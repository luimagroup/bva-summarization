round 18, index 32: 
While this case is in remand status, the veteran is free to submit additional evidence and argument on the question at issue.

round 19, index 31: 
Then, the case should be returned to the Board for further appellate consideration.

round 20, index 6: 
Based on the foregoing, the Board indicated that that the possibility of service connection for an anxiety disorder should be developed on appeal.

round 21, index 18: 
When the remand orders of the Board or the Court are not complied with, the Board errs as a matter of law when it fails to ensure compliance, and a further remand will be mandated.

round 22, index 7: 
The Board directed the RO to schedule the veteran for a VA psychiatric examination in order to identify whether he had PTSD or any other psychiatric disorder.

round 23, index 9: 
The Board also directed the RO to readjudicate the issue of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD.

In light of the above, the claim must be remanded to the RO.

round 27, index 4: 
In its November 1998 remand, the Board noted that the veteran's service medical records showed an impression of anxiety in April 1967.

round 28, index 14: 
However, in so doing, the RO did not fully develop the issue service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, which may potentially include other diagnoses.

round 29, index 15: 
Second, notwithstanding the Board's references to an anxiety disorder, the RO did not readjudicate the issue of entitlement to service connection for any acquired psychiatric disability but instead limited its inquiry to PTSD.

round 30, index 0: 
The veteran had active military service in the United States Marine Corps from March 1966 to April 1969.

round 31, index 2: 
This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 1997 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in Houston, Texas (the RO) which denied the veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

round 32, index 8: 
The RO was to instruct the VA psychiatrist to render an opinion as to whether any psychiatric disorder found was related to the veteran's military service, to include the entries in 1966 and 1967 which referred to functional headache, hypochondriacal symptoms and anxiety.

round 33, index 3: 
This matter was previously before the Board in November 1998, at which time it was remanded for further development of the evidence.

round 34, index 12: 
First, the RO did not schedule the veteran for a VA psychiatric examination.

round 35, index 10: 
The RO was  instructed that if the benefit sought on appeal was not granted, the RO should issue a Supplemental Statement of the Case and provide the veteran and his representative an opportunity to respond.

round 36, index 13: 
It appears that because the RO found that evidence received since the November 1998 remand did not verify the veteran's claimed PTSD stressors, there was no need to schedule him for another VA psychiatric examination.
