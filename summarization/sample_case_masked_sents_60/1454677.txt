round 22, index 1: 
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2009 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Louisville, Kentucky.

round 23, index 14: 
The Board finds that the proximity of the Veteran's treatment for bipolar disorder, coupled with the July 2013 examiner's notation that the Veteran continued to experience symptoms as recently as 2011, is evidence of a current psychological disorder.

round 24, index 5: 
After review of the claims file, the Board finds that additional development is necessary prior to adjudication of the Veteran's claim.

round 25, index 3: 
Because the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim and reported symptoms and all other information of record, the Board has re-characterized this claim more broadly to encompass all psychiatric disorders.

round 27, index 27:

round 30, index 11: 
The evidence also reflects that the Veteran has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder in the past.

round 31, index 15: 
In light of the Veteran's confirmed in-service stressor and current disorder, a medical opinion regarding the nexus of the Veteran's bipolar disorder is required.

round 32, index 10: 
Further, the examiner stated that there was no discernible nexus between the Veteran's mood disturbances and his in-service stressor.

round 33, index 17: 
The opinion is also inadequate because it does not address whether the Veteran's bipolar disorder is related to any other aspect of his military service besides the specific stressors asserted in his PTSD claim.

round 34, index 12: 
Specifically, VA treatment records from February and April 2009 contain an Axis I diagnosis of bipolar disorder by history.

The examiner noted that he had a history of mood disturbances but that these had been in remission for approximately two years.

round 40, index 16:
