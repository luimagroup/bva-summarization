J.E. also noted that there was a diagnosis of anxiety neurosis in the mid 70's, diagnoses of bipolar/mixed affective/cluster C personality traits in the mid 90's, and PTSD/chronic delayed onset and major depressive disorder also in the mid 90's.  Dr. J.E. noted that the presence of Axis II "Personality traits" had been highlighted throughout the years (Passive, Aggressive, Cluster C, etc.); and that the detailed assessment in January 1999 revealed that through the years the veteran experienced the following PTSD symptoms: exposure to a traumatic event, recurrent/intensive/distressing recollections of event, persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with event, feelings of detachment/estrangement from others, symptoms of increased arousal (difficulty concentrating, irritability, sleep disturbance).

round 8, index 150: 
Dr. J.E. initially determined that it was reasonable to conclude from the medical evidence of record that the veteran had a "traumatic incident" when, at age 18, he accidentally shot a fellow soldier and experienced loss of rank, court-martial and transfer; that one year later the veteran was hospitalized with anxiety/depression symptoms when the diagnosis was "stress/accidental shooting" and "passive-aggressive reaction."

round 9, index 228: 
(1)

round 10, index 153: 
In response to the Board's question concerning whether the diagnosis of a personality disorder made during active service was a correct one, the IME indicated: "Possibly yes".

round 11, index 230: 
(2)

round 12, index 154: 
It was noted that clearly the veteran had presented a number of personality disorder traits.

round 13, index 155: 
In response to the Board's question concerning what is the veteran's most likely current diagnosis or diagnoses, the IME concluded that on Axis I, the diagnosis is PTSD, based on the PTSD symptoms reported above and on Axis II, the diagnosis is Cluster C Personality Traits (avoidant, dependent).

round 14, index 39: 
Standard of reviewOnce the evidence has been assembled, the Board has the duty to assess the credibility and weight to be given to the evidence.

round 15, index 231: 
You are no longer required to file a copy of your Notice of Appeal with VA's General Counsel.

?

round 20, index 233: 
In the section entitled "Representation before VA," filing a "Notice of Disagreement with respect to the claim on or after November 18, 1988" is no longer a condition for an attorney-at-law or a VA accredited agent to charge you a fee for representing you.

round 21, index 227: 
These changes apply to the section entitled "Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims."

round 22, index 157: 
The IME continued that the PTSD symptoms seem to be related to a traumatic event during service.

round 23, index 229: 
A "Notice of Disagreement filed on or after November 18, 1988" is no longer required to appeal to the Court.

round 24, index 158: 
Also, the veteran's personality disorder traits may have made him more vulnerable to the traumatic event.

round 25, index 40: 
When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.

round 26, index 131: 
Dr.

round 27, index 220: 
Board concludes that the weight of competent and credible evidence supports a grant of service connection for PTSD.

round 28, index 165: 
The VCAA is applicable to all claims filed on or after the date of enactment, November 9, 2000, or filed before the date of enactment and not yet final as of that date.

round 29, index 166: 
Except for provisions pertaining to claims to reopen based upon the submission of new and material evidence, which are not applicable in the instant case, the implementing regulations are also effective November 9, 2000.

round 30, index 203: 
With respect to element (2), an in-service stressor, the

round 31, index 164: 
Regulations implementing the VCAA have been enacted.

round 32, index 41: 
To deny a claim on its merits, the evidence must preponderate against the claim.

The veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1957 to March 1961.

round 35, index 49: 
The veteran re-enlisted for a second tour of duty in December 1959.

round 36, index 167: 
In this case, the regulations are accordingly applicable.

round 37, index 138: 
M. concluded by stating that the veteran's "mood problems and character style would certainly be evident in his history whether he spent time in the military or not."

round 38, index 202: 
Accordingly, the first element of 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.304(f) is established.

round 39, index 204: 
Board is required to "make specific findings of fact as to whether or not the veteran was engaged in combat with the enemy and, if so, whether the claimed stressor is related to such combat."

round 40, index 136: 
The accidental shooting would, in the words of Dr. M., be certainly traumatic and bothersome for any average individual, but the veteran lacked the psychological resources to adapt to relationships and normal life demands.

round 41, index 132: 
M.'s assessment summary shows that the veteran was suspicious, avoidant and angry with others.

round 42, index 135: 
M. that most of the veteran's symptoms associated with PTSD were better accounted for by his longstanding depression, anxiety and personality disorder.

round 43, index 133: 
He was likely to be argumentative in the course of his relationships.

round 44, index 183: 
Accordingly, the Board will proceed to a decision on the merits.

round 45, index 134: 
He tended to attribute much of his dysfunction to the accidental shooting incident during his period of military service.

round 46, index 199: 
(1)

round 47, index 140: 
M. entered diagnoses on Axis I of chronic dysthymia disorder with a significant anxiety component; history of recurrent major depressive episodes which were in partial or full remission at the time of the examination; rule out bipolar II disorder; and history of alcohol abuse, resolved by report of the veteran, and in remote history.

round 48, index 149:

round 49, index 141: 
On Axis II, the diagnosis was mixed personality disorder with prominent passive-aggressive features.

round 50, index 142: 
In January 2002, the Board requested an IME opinion.

round 51, index 148: 
If so, what is its diagnosis?

round 52, index 212: 
After having considered the entire record in this case, the

round 53, index 213: 
Board concludes that service connection is in order for an acquired psychiatric disability, specifically  PTSD.

round 54, index 211: 
credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and medical evidence of a causal nexus between current symptomatology and the specific claimed in-service stressor.

round 55, index 59: 
He was diagnosed with passive-aggressive reaction, manifested by increasing tension, difficulty with authority, alleged difficulty restraining hostile impulses and manipulative propensities.

round 56, index 58: 
It was the opinion of the psychiatric staff that he was not homicidal but rather represented a passive-aggressive character which was confirmed on psychological testing.

round 57, index 200: 
A current medical diagnosis of PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a causal nexus between current symptomatology and the specific claimed in-service stressor.

round 58, index 24: 
The order of the Court is the law of the case.

round 59, index 209: 
Thus, the Board finds that all three elements of 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.304(f) have been satisfied.
