round 0, index 80: 
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.

round 1, index 78: 
In view of the foregoing, because there is no credible supporting evidence of an in-service stressor, the Board concludes that the preponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

round 2, index 79: 
The benefit sought on appeal must, accordingly, be denied.

round 3, index 77: 
Consequently, absent probative supporting evidence, an essential element for a grant of service connection for PTSD is not established.

round 4, index 76: 
Thus, there is no probative evidence that the claimed in-service stressors actually occurred.

round 5, index 75: 
In conclusion, there is no evidence that the veteran engaged in combat and the only evidence of in-service stressors are contained in the veteran's uncorroborated statements, and private medical records based on the veteran's uncorroborated statements.

round 6, index 11: 
Thereafter, another letter was issued in September 2006.

round 7, index 74: 
Service connection for PTSD must be denied as there is no evidence that any current PTSD that he may suffer from is related to any stressors that occurred during his active duty service.

round 8, index 14: 
The July and September 2003 letters have clearly advised the veteran of the evidence necessary to substantiate his claim of service connection for PTSD.

round 9, index 10: 
The letter predated the September 2003 rating decision.

round 10, index 33: 
The veteran's DD Form 214 reflects that he served during the Vietnam Era; however, he had no foreign and/or sea service.

round 11, index 35: 
As it is not shown the veteran engaged in combat, his unsupported assertions of service stressors are not sufficient to establish the occurrence of such events.

round 12, index 25: 
Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service.

round 13, index 12: 
Collectively, the VCAA letters notified the veteran of what information and evidence is needed to substantiate his claim of service connection for PTSD, as well as what information and evidence must be submitted by the claimant, what information and evidence will be obtained by VA, and the need for the claimant to submit any evidence in his possession that pertains to the claim.

round 14, index 15: 
In March 2006, the veteran was provided with notice of the types of evidence necessary to establish a disability rating and the type of evidence necessary to establish an effective date.

round 15, index 17: 
In any event, since the Board concludes below that the preponderance of the evidence is against entitlement to service connection, any questions as to the appropriate disability rating and effective date to be assigned are rendered moot.

round 16, index 81: 
Veterans Law Judge, Board of Veterans' Appeals Department of Veterans Affairs

round 17, index 16: 
Despite initial inadequate notice provided to the veteran, the Board finds no prejudice to him in proceeding with the issuance of a final decision.

round 18, index 18: 
The Board also finds that VA has complied with all assistance provisions of VCAA.

round 19, index 19: 
The evidence of record contains the veteran's service medical records and post-service private medical records.

round 20, index 5: 
Any current PTSD is not related to the veteran's active duty service.

round 21, index 24: 
If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.

round 22, index 20: 
There is no indication of relevant, outstanding records which would support the veteran's claim.

round 23, index 21: 
For all the foregoing reasons, the Board concludes that VA's duties to the veteran have been fulfilled with respect to the issue on appeal.

round 24, index 13: 
Id.; but see VA O.G.C. Prec. Op. No. 1-2004 (Feb. 24, 2004).

round 25, index 22: 
Criteria & AnalysisApplicable law provides that service connection will be granted if it is shown that the veteran suffers from disability resulting from an injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty, in the active military, naval, or air service.

round 26, index 9: 
In this case, VA satisfied its duties to the veteran in a VCAA letter issued in July 2003.

round 27, index 27: 
and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.

round 28, index 8: 
Under the VCAA, VA has a duty to notify the veteran of any information and evidence needed to substantiate and complete a claim, and of what part of that evidence is to be provided by the claimant and what part VA will attempt to obtain for the claimant.

round 29, index 23: 
That an injury or disease occurred in service alone is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury.

round 30, index 26: 
Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a), a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor;

round 31, index 0: 
The veteran served on active duty from November 1971 until August 1975.

round 32, index 1: 
This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2003 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

round 33, index 2: 
A notice of disagreement was filed in October 2003, a statement of the case was issued in November 2004, and a substantive appeal was received in January 2005.

round 34, index 7: 
On November 9, 2000, the President signed into law the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), which has been codified at 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126;

round 35, index 34: 
Service personnel records reflect that he served as an "Air Trans. Occup." in the United States.

round 36, index 3: 
The veteran requested a hearing before the Board and withdrew that request in September 2006.1.

round 37, index 67: 
Additionally, although he claimed that a friend, Mr. W., died in a crash, he did not provide any other information pertaining to Mr. W., such as his first name, rank, and the date or approximate date of such death.

round 38, index 68: 
Thus, the veteran's statements do not provide specific details of claimed stressors that could be corroborated.

round 39, index 69: 
The Board acknowledges the veteran's statements that he had traumatic experiences in service; nevertheless, the veteran has failed to provide the necessary specifics of stressor information to confirm the stressor.

round 40, index 66: 
Specifically, although the veteran claims that he cleaned up crash sites in 1973, he did not provide any detailed information pertaining to the date of a specific crash to allow for verification.

round 41, index 36: 
Because the record does not persuasively show participation in combat, the claimed stressors must be corroborated.

round 42, index 4: 
The veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy, and he has not furnished sufficient information regarding claimed stressors to allow for verification.

round 43, index 31: 
With regard to the question of whether the veteran engaged in combat, the phrase "engaged in combat with the enemy," as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1154(b), requires that a veteran have participated in events constituting an actual fight or encounter with a military foe or hostile unit or instrumentality.

round 44, index 32: 
Mere service in a combat area or combat zone does not in itself lead to the conclusion that an individual engaged in combat.

round 45, index 28: 
If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.

round 46, index 29: 
The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) require that a diagnosis of a mental disorder conform to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).

round 47, index 70: 
Thus, the veteran has not furnished any details of alleged stressors to allow for an attempt to verify such claimed stressors.

round 48, index 58: 
He claimed these experiences led to his increased alcohol consumption as self-medication.

round 49, index 60:

He claimed one crew member kept a skull and used it as an ashtray.

round 51, index 55: 
He claimed he had to clean up the site following the crash of a good friend, Mr. W.

round 52, index 59: 
He claimed to have severe feelings of guilt, nightmares, depression, isolation, and continual reliving of these events.

round 53, index 30: 
Initially, the Board finds that there is no evidence that the veteran participated in combat during active service.

round 54, index 56: 
He claimed that he still visualizes Mr. W. and the other trainees who died in crashes.

round 55, index 37: 
His alleged service stressors must be established by official service records or other credible supporting evidence.

round 56, index 6: 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAWPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated during the veteran's active duty service.

round 57, index 71: 
The Board acknowledges that the veteran has not been afforded a VA examination to assess whether he has PTSD, however, assuming for the sake of argument that a diagnosis of PTSD was rendered, his claim would still fail since there is no competent evidence that any PTSD is related to a verified stressor.

round 58, index 61: 
Moreover, his service personnel records do not reflect that he was assigned to crash unit security.

round 59, index 43: 
He has five to six hours of broken sleep at night, has trouble maintaining his weight, is sad all of the time, very withdrawn, has no outside interests and has some fleeting thoughts of self harm.
