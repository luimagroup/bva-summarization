round 9, index 36:

round 11, index 45: 
This remand is in the nature of a preliminary order and does not constitute a decision of the Board on the merits of your appeal.

round 12, index 34:

round 15, index 42: 
GEORGE R. SENYK	Member, Board of Veterans' AppealsThe Board of Veterans' Appeals Administrative Procedures Improvement Act, Pub. L. No. 103-271, § 6, 108 Stat. 740, 741 (1994), permits a proceeding instituted before the Board to be assigned to an individual member of the Board for a determination.

round 16, index 35: 
If the facts surrounding the veterans stressor events and psychiatric symptomatology have changed significantly, then another psychiatric examination is likely warranted.

round 17, index 10: 
Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet.App. 406 (1991).

round 18, index 23: 
If the fact scenario has changed significantly, another VA psychiatric examination may be warranted.

round 19, index 44: 
Board of Veterans' Appeals is appealable to the United States Court of Veterans Appeals.

round 20, index 43: 
This proceeding has been assigned to an individual member of the Board.

round 21, index 15: 
Upon remand, then, it must be determined whether the veteran participated in combat.

round 22, index 24: 
The report of the January 1994 VA examination shows that the examination was particularly thorough, as it lasted for three sessions, covering a total of six hours of interviews with the veteran.

round 23, index 26: 
In order to conserve administrative and judicial resources, the Board is of the opinion that unless further evidence is uncovered which would change the examiners understanding of the veterans history and background, an additional examination will not be necessary.

round 24, index 25: 
The report itself is quite comprehensive, covering the veterans history and mental status in depth.

round 25, index 22: 
Following this development, the RO should review the record to determine whether the facts supporting the veterans claim are materially different.

round 26, index 16: 
If not, further evidentiary development to corroborate the veterans contentions will be necessary.

round 27, index 21: 
Records reflecting the veterans mental health proximate to service could be very probative on his claim.

round 28, index 11: 
The veterans service personnel records are not in his claims file.

round 29, index 9: 
The Court has held that the Board is not bound to accept the diagnosis of PTSD if the evidence of record does not objectively support that diagnosis.

round 30, index 0: 
The veteran served on active duty from August 1969 to March 1971.

round 31, index 4: 
The veteran contends that service connection is warranted for PTSD.

round 32, index 5: 
He asserts he experienced traumatic events during his Vietnam service and has suffered anxiety, nightmares, and thoughts of combat since discharge.

round 33, index 2: 
The substantive appeal, however, submitted in a timely fashion and signed by the veteran, was limited to the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

round 34, index 20: 
Apparently he was prescribed the drug Ritalin for symptoms of hyperactivity.

round 35, index 3: 
In the absence of a substantive appeal regarding the other disabilities originally claimed, the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) has no jurisdiction over these issues and will not address them further herein.

round 36, index 8: 
Instead, the record must contain service records which corroborate the veterans testimony as to the occurrence of the claimed stressor.

round 37, index 12: 
These records are necessary to corroborate the veterans reported assignments during service.

round 38, index 17: 
In this regard, it is important to note that some of the events which the veteran claims occurred during service and which continue to haunt him, such as the rape and beating of a Vietnamese girl, and his involvement with drugs during service are most likely unverifiable and if true, would have constituted misconduct on his part.

round 39, index 7: 
Where, however, the VA determines that the veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy, or that the veteran did engage in combat with the enemy but the claimed stressor is not related to such combat, the veterans lay testimony and/or written contentions, by themselves, will not be enough to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.

round 40, index 1: 
The veterans original claim included allegations of entitlement to service connection for other disabilities in addition to PTSD.

round 41, index 19: 
The veteran reports receiving psychiatric treatment from a Dr. Jablin soon after his discharge from service.

round 42, index 18: 
Service connection may be granted only when a disability was not the result of the veterans own willful misconduct.

round 43, index 0: 
The veteran served on active duty from August 1969 to March 1971.

round 44, index 6: 
Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence establishing a clear diagnosis of the condition, credible supporting evidence that the claimed inservice stressor actually occurred, and a link between current symptomatology and the claimed inservice stressor.

round 45, index 14: 
As outlined above, if the veteran participated in combat and the stressor is related to combat, no further development is necessary.

round 46, index 0: 
The veteran served on active duty from August 1969 to March 1971.
