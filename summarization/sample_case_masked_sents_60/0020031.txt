As indicated before, there is no competent medical evidence of PTSD and also no evidence of medical causation or an etiological relationship concerning PTSD and service.

The claim of service connection for PTSD is not well grounded.

round 6, index 35: 
In fact PTSD has not been reported as a diagnosis at all.

round 7, index 37: 
Lay testimony is insufficient to fulfill the burden because lay persons generally lack the expertise necessary to opine on matters involving medical knowledge.

However, there is absolutely no indication from the record that the veteran has received treatment for PTSD.

round 9, index 17: 
In June 1998 the RO forwarded a letter requesting information from the veteran including the dates and places of his military assignments and duties; to whom his claimed sexual assaulted was reported and if an investigation occurred; a list of persons nearby during the assault and if there were any related events.

round 10, index 18: 
In conjunction with the letter the RO also forwarded to the veteran a PTSD information support form.

round 15, index 36:

round 20, index 13: 
The diagnosis was emotional unstable personality, chronic, severe, manifested by an inability to react properly.

round 21, index 6: 
In order for a claim to be well grounded, there must be competent evidence of current disability (a medical diagnosis); of incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service (lay or medical evidence); and of a nexus between inservice disease or injury and the current disability (medical evidence).

round 22, index 12: 
The July 1967 psychiatric examination revealed that the veteran was emotionally unstable and immature.

round 23, index 7: 
Establishing service connection for PTSD requires a greater evidentiary showing than that necessary to well ground the claim.

The provisional diagnosis was antagonistic behavior disorder.

round 25, index 9: 
If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, and hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.

round 26, index 8: 
Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. ยง 4.125(a), a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed inservice stressor actually occurred.

round 32, index 33: 
Lay evidence of a sexual assault sufficient for the service incurrence requirement for a well-grounded clam has been received.

He stated that by keeping the circumstances surrounding his rape in service secret, he had created a block in his ability to fully and comfortably live his life.
