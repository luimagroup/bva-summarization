round 35, index 3: 
In November 2010, the Veteran offered testimony at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge at the RO.

round 36, index 16: 
These records show that the Veteran was diagnosed as having PTSD in January 2009 by a VA psychiatrist, and that he continued to be treated for PTSD as well as other psychiatric disabilities by this psychiatrist.

round 40, index 18: 
Under the VCAA, VA is obliged to provide an examination when the record contains competent evidence that the claimant has a current disability or signs and symptoms of a current disability, the record indicates that the disability or signs and symptoms of disability may be associated with active service; and the record does not contain sufficient information to make a decision on the claim.

round 49, index 22: 
He has reported plausible stressors that are consistent with the facts and circumstances of his service.

round 50, index 12: 
The records show that the September 2006 rating decision which denied the Veteran's claim did so on the basis that there was no there was no diagnosis of PTSD, and the current diagnosis of schizophrenia was not shown in service or until many years after discharge from service.
