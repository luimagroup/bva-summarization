round 2, index 22: 
After securing any necessary releases, the RO should attempt to obtain a copy of any indicated records which have not been obtained previously.

round 6, index 51: 
The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

round 10, index 19: 
As part of the notice, VA is to specifically inform the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of which portion, if any, of the evidence is to be provided by the claimant and which part, if any, VA will attempt to obtain on behalf of the claimant.

round 11, index 50: 
This claim must be afforded expeditious treatment by the RO.

round 12, index 38: 
The claims folder, to include a copy of this Remand and any additional evidence secured, must be made available to the examiner for proper review of the medical history.

round 15, index 49: 
The appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded to the RO.

round 16, index 37: 
If PTSD is not diagnosed, the examiner should explain why the veteran does not meet the criteria for this diagnosis.

round 17, index 46: 
Thereafter, subject to current appellate procedures, the case should be returned to the Board for further appellate consideration, if appropriate.

round 18, index 18:

round 21, index 34: 
Any indicated studies, tests and evaluations should be performed.

round 22, index 33: 
Upon completion of the above development, the veteran should be afforded a VA examination by a psychiatrist to determine if he has PTSD which is etiologically related to his military service.

round 23, index 35: 
A diagnosis of PTSD under DSM IV criteria should be made or ruled out.

round 24, index 32: 
The veteran should be requested to submit corroborating evidence of his alleged stressors, such as statements from persons who served with him and have knowledge of the alleged stressors.

round 25, index 31:

round 26, index 24:

round 27, index 40:

round 30, index 42: 
If any development is incomplete, appropriate corrective action is to be implemented.

round 31, index 16: 
It essentially eliminates the requirement that a claimant submit evidence of a well-grounded claim, and provides that VA will assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate a claim but is not required to provide assistance to a claimant if there is no reasonable possibility that such assistance would aid in substantiating the claim.

round 32, index 0: 
The veteran had active military service from November 1944 to November 1946.

round 33, index 1:

round 34, index 2: 
This matter was REMANDED by a member of the Board in October 1993 and March 1996 for the purpose of obtaining additional factual and medical evidence.

round 35, index 44: 
Then, the RO should readjudicate the issue on appeal.

round 36, index 28: 
This summary, a copy of any stressor statements from the veteran, and a copy of any pertinent personnel records should be sent to the U.S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records (USASCRUR), 7798 Cissna Road, Suite 101, Springfield, Virginia 22150-3197, for verification of the veteran's alleged stressors.

round 37, index 43: 
Then, the RO should undertake any other development it deems to be required to comply with the notice and duty to assist provisions of the VCAA.

round 38, index 39: 
The examination report is to reflect that such a review of the claims folder was made.

round 39, index 17:

round 40, index 12: 
The Court has stated that compliance by the Board or the RO is neither optional nor discretionary.

round 41, index 13: 
Where the remand orders of the Board or the Court are not complied with, the Board errs as a matter of law when it fails to ensure compliance.

round 42, index 14: 
Finally, the Board notes that during the pendency of the veteran's appeal but after the RO's most recent consideration of the veteran's claim, the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000), was signed into law.

round 43, index 30: 
The RO should then carefully review all evidence obtained pursuant to the development requested above.

round 44, index 29: 
In doing so, the RO should provide as much detailed information regarding the veteran's service as possible, including the units listed in paragraph 3, page 2, of the Board's October 1993 remand (with 81st Division and Signal Battalion corrected to 88th Division and Signal Battalion).

round 45, index 4: 
However, this decision was vacated by the Board in July 2001 based on the determination that there had been a due process violation in the November 1996 decision.

round 46, index 3: 
The claim for service connection for PTSD was subsequently denied by the Board in November 1996.

round 47, index 5: 
In its March 1996 REMAND, the Board directed the RO to contact the veteran and request that he complete a Questionnaire About Military Service (NA Form 13075), and to attempt to verify the veteran's purported in-service stressors through the U.S. Army and Joint Services Environmental Support Group (ESG) [now named the United States Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records (USASCRUR)].

round 48, index 9: 
A completed NA Form 13075 was apparently received by the RO on April 3, 1996, but for reasons unclear to the Board, was not associated with the claims folder until some time after the Board's November 1996 decision.

round 49, index 11: 
The RO is advised that the Board is obligated by law to ensure that the RO complies with its directives, as well as those of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).

round 50, index 10: 
In addition, the RO failed to comply with the Board's directive to attempt to verify the veteran's claimed in-service stressors through USASCRUR.

round 51, index 8: 
He was told that he had 60 days from the date of the letter to respond and that the matter would be returned to the Board without further development if he failed to respond within 60 days.

round 52, index 6: 
Although the RO had previously attempted to verify the veteran's alleged stressors through the USASCRUR, its request to the USASCRUR did not adequately identify the veteran's claimed stressors.

round 53, index 7: 
Pursuant to the Board's remand, a letter was mailed to the veteran on March 21, 1996, which asked him to complete the NA Form 13075.
