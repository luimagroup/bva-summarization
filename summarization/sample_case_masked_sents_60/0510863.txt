round 0, index 105: 
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

round 1, index 104:

round 2, index 103: 
The preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for service connection for PTSD.

round 3, index 102: 
Consequently, the claim of service connection for PTSD must be denied.

A critical element needed to establish service connection for PTSD is therefore missing.

round 5, index 35: 
He has not identified any additional, relevant evidence that has not been requested or obtained.

round 6, index 34:

round 7, index 36: 
For the aforementioned reasons, there is no reasonable possibility that further assistance would aid in the substantiation of the claim.

round 8, index 37: 
In short, the requirements under the VCAA have been met.

round 9, index 38: 
Accordingly, there is no potential prejudice to the veteran for failure to develop the claim.

round 10, index 39:

G.H. Shufelt	Veterans Law Judge, Board of Veterans' Appeals Department of Veterans Affairs

Service records indicate the veteran is a non-combat veteran who served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam War period.

round 19, index 41:

round 25, index 97: 
There must be credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressors actually occurred.

round 26, index 9:

round 27, index 11: 
The claimant must be given proper notice and an opportunity to respond.

round 28, index 10: 
The VCAA also created 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103A, which codifies VA's duty to assist, and essentially states that VA will make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate a claim.

round 29, index 12: 
Implementing regulations for the VCAA were subsequently enacted, which were also made effective November 9, 2000, for the most part.

round 30, index 13: 
The intended effect of the implementing regulations was to establish clear guidelines consistent with the intent of Congress regarding the timing and scope of assistance VA will provide to claimants who file a claim for benefits.

round 31, index 14: 
Both the VCAA and the implementing regulations are applicable in the present case, and will be collectively referred to as "the VCAA."

This has not been provided or demonstrated as the evidence shows the veteran's claimed in-service stressors are inconsistent with the activities attributed to the company the veteran was assigned to.

round 35, index 96: 
Because the service records and evidence do not establish that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, the veteran may not rely on his lay testimony alone to establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressors.

round 36, index 75: 
Even if the condition at issue is initially diagnosed after the veteran's discharge from service, service connection may still be granted for any disability first noted after discharge, when all of the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service.

round 37, index 5: 
There is no credible supporting evidence to verify or corroborate the veteran's claimed in-service stressors of being exposed to enemy mortar and rocket attacks, and being a witness to a rocket attack that killed a friend of his, while operating in "Dong Ha" and "Gong Hoi," Vietnam, during approximately December 1967 to March 1968.

round 38, index 74: 
In order to establish service connection for the disability, the evidence must show it resulted from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.

round 39, index 76: 
Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence establishing a diagnosis of the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) (2004); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptomatology and an in-service stressor;

and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred.

round 41, index 92: 
A search for remarks containing an incident where a rocket hit a bunker killing a person named "John" found no reference to an explosion or those killed in action.

round 42, index 93: 
The evidence shows that the veteran was diagnosed by a VA physician for PTSD.

round 43, index 94: 
However the evidence also shows that the diagnosis was made without a review of the case folder or a review of the recent evidence regarding the veteran's company assignment and company activities, and thus the diagnosis was based primarily on the veteran's own reported history of combat exposure.

round 44, index 78: 
If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.

round 45, index 89:

round 48, index 79: 
If the evidence establishes that the veteran was a prisoner of war under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(y) (2004), and the claimed stressor is related to that prisoner-of-war experience, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.

round 49, index 15: 
To comply with the aforementioned VCAA requirements under 38 U.S.C. § 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b), the RO must satisfy the following four duty to notify and assist requirements.

round 56, index 57: 
Based on the veteran's reported history, the examiner diagnosed the veteran with PTSD and found the veteran to be socially isolated, suffering from flashbacks, and suffering from survivor guilt, with interrupted sleep.
