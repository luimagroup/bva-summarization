REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONDuties to Notify and AssistIn a correspondence dated in March 2003 and August 2006, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) satisfied its duty to notify the Veteran under 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a) (West 2002) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b) (2008).

round 5, index 11: 
Specifically, in the March 2003 notice, the AOJ notified the Veteran of information and evidence necessary to substantiate his claim for service connection for PTSD.

round 6, index 12: 
He was notified of the information and evidence that VA would seek to provide and the information and evidence that he was expected to provide.

round 7, index 13: 
In the August  2006 notice, the RO informed the Veteran of the process by which disability ratings and effective dates are assigned.

round 8, index 14: 
Although the August 2006 notice was delivered after the rating decision, the AOJ subsequently readjudicated the claims based on all the evidence in the February 2009 supplemental statement of the case (SSOC).

round 9, index 15: 
(the issuance of a fully compliant notification letter followed by readjudication of the claim, such as an SOC or SSOC, is sufficient to cure a timing defect).

round 10, index 16: 
Thus, the Veteran was not precluded from participating effectively in the processing of his claims and the late notice did not affect the essential fairness of the decision.

round 11, index 46:

round 25, index 52: 
If the evidence establishes that the Veteran was engaged in combat with the enemy or was a prisoner of war (POW), and the claimed stressor is related to combat or POW experiences (in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service), the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
