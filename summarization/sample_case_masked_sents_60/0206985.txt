round 0, index 60: 
The claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.

round 1, index 59: 
However, that doctrine is not applicable in this case because the preponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim.

round 2, index 12: 
The criteria for entitlement to service connection for PTSD have not been met.

round 3, index 56: 
However, the evidence of record does not in any way reflect participation in combat with the enemy, and there is no evidence showing that the veteran's current diagnosis of PTSD is based upon a verified stressor from service.

round 4, index 61: 
JEFF MARTIN	Member, Board of Veterans' AppealsIMPORTANT NOTICE:

round 5, index 14: 
Initially, the Board finds that all relevant facts have been properly developed in regard to the veteran's claim, and no further assistance is required in order to comply with the VA's statutory duty to assist him with the development of facts pertinent to his claim.

round 6, index 62: 
We have attached a VA Form 4597 that tells you what steps you can take if you disagree with our decision.

round 7, index 11: 
The veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD is not predicated upon a verified in-service stressor.

round 8, index 57: 
As such, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

round 9, index 13: 
66 Fed. Reg. 45630-45632 (Aug. 29, 2001) (to be codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. § 3.159).

round 10, index 63: 
We are in the process of updating the form to reflect changes in the law effective on December 27, 2001.

round 11, index 64: 
In the meanwhile, please note these important corrections to the advice in the form:

round 12, index 37: 
Moreover, the veteran has not in any way alleged that he participated in combat during his military service.

round 13, index 10: 
All relevant evidence necessary to render a decision on the veteran's claim has been obtained by the RO, and the RO has notified him of the type of evidence needed to substantiate his claim.

round 14, index 16: 
The VA's duty to notify the veteran of the evidence necessary to substantiate his claim has also been met, as the RO informed him of the need for such evidence in the April 1991 Statement of the Case.

round 15, index 70: 
?

round 16, index 65: 
These changes apply to the section entitled "Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims."

round 17, index 66: 
(1)

round 18, index 68: 
(2)

round 19, index 69: 
You are no longer required to file a copy of your Notice of Appeal with VA's General Counsel.

round 20, index 28: 
The Board has first considered the question of whether the veteran has a medical diagnosis of PTSD.

round 21, index 71: 
In the section entitled "Representation before VA," filing a "Notice of Disagreement with respect to the claim on or after November 18, 1988" is no longer a condition for an attorney-at-law or a VA accredited agent to charge you a fee for representing you.

round 22, index 36: 
Board observes that he did not have service during a period of war and was not stationed overseas at any time during service.

round 23, index 15: 
Moreover, as described in further detail below, the RO has made all necessary efforts to verify the veteran's claimed in-service PTSD stressors.

round 24, index 58: 
In reaching this decision, the Board acknowledges that the VA is statutorily required to resolve the benefit of the doubt in favor of the veteran when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an outstanding issue.

round 25, index 67: 
A "Notice of Disagreement filed on or after November 18, 1988" is no longer required to appeal to the Court.

round 26, index 27: 
Such corroborating evidence cannot consist solely of after-the-fact medical evidence containing an opinion as to a causal relationship between PTSD and service.

round 27, index 30: 
VA examination reports from March 1992 and January 1998 contain a diagnosis of PTSD.

round 28, index 31: 
The Board also finds no other evidence that calls this diagnosis into serious question.

round 29, index 9: 
This development will be accomplished by the Board in accordance with the revised provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 19.9, and the issue of entitlement to TDIU will be addressed in a separate, forthcoming Board decision.

round 30, index 17: 
Specifically, the RO informed the veteran that, for his claim to be granted, there would have to be evidence of PTSD based on a verified in-service stressor.

round 31, index 55: 
Board finds that the evidence of record shows that the veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD.

round 32, index 7: 
The Court granted this motion in the same month, and the case is again before the Board.

round 33, index 0: 
The veteran served on active duty from February 1976 to January 1978.

round 34, index 1: 
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 1990 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

round 35, index 2: 
The veteran's claim was initially denied by the Board in January 1995.

round 36, index 8: 
The issue of entitlement to TDIU was also subject to the September 2001 Court order, but the Board has determined that additional development is needed in regard to this issue.

round 37, index 6: 
specifically, the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103 (West 1991 & Supp. 2001) were described as not having been adequately discussed by the Board.

round 38, index 54: 
Overall, based upon a review of the entire claims file, the

round 39, index 26: 
Instead, the record must contain service records or other credible evidence corroborating the stressor.

round 40, index 25: 
Where, however, the VA determines that the veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy and was not a POW, or the claimed stressor is not related to combat or POW experiences, the veteran's lay statements, by themselves, will not be enough to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.

round 41, index 32: 
Nevertheless, the veteran's diagnosis of PTSD must be based upon either participation in combat with the enemy or a verified in-service stressor for service connection to be warranted, as noted above.

round 42, index 18: 
The RO has further informed the veteran of the need for such evidence in several subsequent Supplemental Statements of the Case.

round 43, index 38: 
As such, the question becomes whether the veteran experienced a verifiable in-service stressor, upon which the current diagnosis of PTSD is predicated.

round 44, index 35: 
With regard to the question of whether the veteran participated in combat with the enemy during service, the

round 45, index 40: 
The Board notes that the veteran's service medical records are entirely negative for documentation of his claimed stressors.

round 46, index 39: 
In this regard, the veteran has reported that he was severely beaten during boot camp, that he feared being beaten to death because of rumors that this had happened to a prior recruit, and that he was afraid of being killed because of the shooting of live ammunition during "motivation" training.

round 47, index 41: 
While the veteran was treated for right upper extremity symptomatology during service, this was attributed to sports injuries at the time of treatment.

round 48, index 42: 
It is acknowledged that the veteran was most likely utilizing live ammunition at some point during his training regimen, although documenting a subjective reaction to this activity that would be emotionally disproportionate would seem to be the evidentiary question presented with regard to this aspect of the stressor situation being considered.

round 49, index 53: 
Board finds that sufficient efforts have been made to verify his stressors and that, even though no stressors were verified, there is no reasonable basis for further stressor development.

round 50, index 19: 
Given that the actions by the RO reflect fundamental compliance with the newly enacted provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 5103 and 5103A, the Board finds that the veteran's appeal will not be adversely affected merely because the RO developed this appeal prior to, and did not inform him of, the enactment of the new provisions.

round 51, index 48: 
In a March 2000 lay submission, the veteran provided additional information, including the names of several other commanders and instructors.

round 52, index 34: 
Thus, the question becomes whether the veteran either engaged in combat with the enemy during service or experienced a verified in-service stressor upon which the diagnosis of PTSD is predicated.

round 53, index 45: 
In October 1998, the veteran's former representative responded that he was unable to remember the names of other individuals with knowledge of the reported stressors.

round 54, index 29: 
In this case, the veteran's current PTSD is confirmed by the evidence of record.

round 55, index 43: 
While the veteran also contended that he was subjected to live ammunition fire during training exercises having a punitive purpose, this assertion would, quite simply, require some form of corroboration, which has not been forthcoming.

round 56, index 44: 
In a September 1998 letter, the RO requested that the veteran provide additional details about his claimed stressors, specifically to include the names of other individuals who could corroborate these stressors.

round 57, index 47: 
A request for further information in this regard from the headquarters of the United States Marine Corps of the Department of the Navy resulted in a negative response in October 1999.

round 58, index 33: 
Again, a favorable medical opinion is insufficient, in and of itself, to predicate the grant of service connection for PTSD.

round 59, index 52: 
Given the limited information provided by the veteran and the RO's attempts to obtain service department information, the
