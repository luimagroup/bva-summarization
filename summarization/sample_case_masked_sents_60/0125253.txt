round 2, index 20:

round 3, index 22: 
The RO should ask the veteran to identify (names, locations, dates) all medical providers who treated him at any time for psychiatric problems after service, and the RO should obtain copies of related medical records which are not already on file.

round 4, index 17: 
Further efforts should be made to obtain pertinent records from during and after service, and another VA examination should be provided.

round 5, index 23: 
The RO should also ask the veteran and his representative to submit copies of any records in their possession concerning past VA adjudications prior to the original claims folder being lost.

round 6, index 21: 
if so, they should be obtained.

round 7, index 31: 
The RO should then review the claim for service connection for a psychiatric disorder, including PTSD.

round 8, index 26: 
The RO should undertake appropriate development to verify the veteran's alleged service stressors for PTSD.

round 9, index 30:

round 10, index 27: 
Thereafter, the veteran should undergo another VA psychiatric examination to determine the nature and etiology of all psychiatric disorders, including PTSD.

round 11, index 35:

round 14, index 15:

round 15, index 32: 
If the claim remains denied, the veteran and his representative should be provided with a supplemental statement of the case, and given an opportunity to respond, before the case is returned to the Board.

L. W. TOBIN	Member, Board of Veterans' AppealsUnder 38 U.S.C.A. ยง 7252 (West 1991 & Supp. 2001), only a decision of the Board of Veterans' Appeals is appealable to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.

round 17, index 24: 
The RO should ask the Social Security Administration (SSA) to provide any medical and other records considered in awards of SSA disability benefits to the veteran, along with copies of the related SSA decisions.

round 18, index 33: 
On remand, the veteran may submit any other evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded to the RO.

round 19, index 5: 
The Board finds that the issue on appeal is service connection for any psychiatric disorder, including PTSD.

round 20, index 6: 
The current claims file indicates that the initial claims file was lost, and the current claims file is a "rebuilt" one containing only partial records.

round 21, index 4:

round 22, index 25: 
(At his last VA examination, the veteran related he received SSA disability benefits from 1975 to 1983.)

round 27, index 11: 
Some medical records from after service have been submitted, including records dated in and after 1975 which show variously diagnosed psychiatric conditions.

round 28, index 10: 
The current rebuilt claims folder does not contain the veteran's service medical records.

round 29, index 16: 
In view of the fact that the original claims folder has been lost, and given the duty to assist requirements of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000), and a recently enacted companion VA regulation, further development of the evidence is warranted.
