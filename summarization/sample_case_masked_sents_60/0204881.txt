Regulations also provide that service connection may be established where all the evidence of record, including that pertinent to service, demonstrates that the veteran's current disability was incurred in service.

round 58, index 90: 
Moreover, a general statement in the veteran's service personnel records that he participated in a particular operation or campaign would not, in itself, establish that he engaged in combat with the enemy because the terms "operation" and "campaign" encompass both combat and non-combat activities.

round 59, index 2: 
After remanding the case for additional development in June 1995, the Board denied the appellant's service connection claim in a decision dated April 29, 1999.
