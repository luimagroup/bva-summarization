round 15, index 47: 
For each diagnosed psychiatric disorder, the examiner should opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent or greater probability) that the disorder had its onset in or is related to active service.

The examiner should also specifically discuss whether it is credible that the Veteran's response to the claimed incidents involved "intense fear, helplessness, or horror."

The physician noted that the attack was not sexual in nature, but rather the Veteran was scalded by hot water, but did not sustain any burns.

round 18, index 36: 
Prior to the examination, the AOJ should obtain any outstanding medical records.

round 19, index 44: 
The examiner should provide a full multi-axial diagnosis pursuant to DSM-IV and specifically state whether each criterion for a diagnosis of PTSD is met, to include discussion of the sufficiency of the stressors involving the assault in the shower and seeing the physical assaults of other recruits.

round 20, index 48: 
The examiner should address the June 1968 service medical record showing that the Veteran was treated for angioneurotic edema and recurrent urticaria and prescribed Atarax for nervous problems, the August 2005 VA examiner's opinion that the Veteran's PTSD with secondary depression was related to a traumatic event during active duty, the March 2007 Vet Center opinion that the Veteran's overall military experience may have led to depression, the March 2011 VA physician's conclusion that the Veteran did not meet criterion A for PTSD, and the August 2014 private physician's opinion that the stressor involving the assault in the shower was sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD and the Veteran has PTSD due to that stressor.

round 21, index 45: 
If the examiner finds that criterion A for a diagnosis of PTSD is met, the examiner should explain specifically how the Veteran's described experiences during service meet the criterion that he "experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others."

round 22, index 38: 
Thus, any treatment notes since that time should be obtained.

round 43, index 30: 
While the March 2011 VA physician opined that the stressor involving the assault in the shower was not sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD, that opinion appears to be based on the fact that the Veteran was not physically harmed by the stressor.

round 44, index 25:

round 45, index 23:

round 53, index 33: 
While the August 2014 private physician opined that the stressor involving the assault in the shower was sufficient and the Veteran has PTSD due to that stressor, that opinion is based on the finding that the Veteran was hypersensitive to stressors.
