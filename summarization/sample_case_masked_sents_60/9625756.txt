round 4, index 231: 
Ultimately, of course, such lay evidence from Mr. [redacted] or the Fallens could not establish medical diagnosis or causation, and thus can not serve as competent evidence of the presence of PTSD or any psychiatric disorder related to service.

round 5, index 15: 
The veteran is not a reliable historian as to alleged stressful events in service; even if it were assumed that he did engage in combat with the enemy his accounts of his experiences are not satisfactory since they are contradicted by service records.

round 12, index 221: 
Since this opinion is that the veteran does not have PTSD, the requirements of Watson are not met.

round 13, index 230:

round 23, index 177: 
It was opined that he veteran had some manifestations of post-traumatic stress disorder, but the examiner believed they may have been of subthreshold magnitude and perhaps half of his psychopathology and impaired social and vocational functioning had been based on personality disorder, anxiety and depression, and that this was only partially related to PTSD.
