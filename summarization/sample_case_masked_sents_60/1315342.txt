round 11, index 22: 
The examiner must review the entire record (to include this remand) in conjunction with the examination, and the examination and the report thereof should be in accordance with DSM-IV.

round 12, index 43:

round 13, index 44: 
The examiner should discuss any credibility issues raised by the record.

round 14, index 41:

round 15, index 19:

round 17, index 25: 
(b)

round 18, index 13:

round 28, index 9:

(a) Please identify (by psychiatric diagnosis) any and each chronic psychiatric disability entity currently found or diagnosed during the pendency of this claim (since the year 2002).

round 33, index 14: 
"The examination did not address whether the appellant's MDD was incurred or aggravated by active duty military service."

round 34, index 18: 
Finally, the Court rejected the Veteran's argument that the Board erred by failing to apply 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.304(f)(3) to her allegations of in-service sexual assaults resulting in PTSD.

round 35, index 17: 
The Court furthermore noted that the Veteran also advances a theory that her first psychiatric symptoms had onset during service after no psychiatric symptoms or defects were noted upon entry (arguing that 38 U.S.C.A. ยง 1111 is applicable to her claim); in this regard, the Court explains that as "VA must still provide the appellant with an adequate medical examination, her additional arguments are best addressed after any further development by VA on remand."

round 36, index 36: 
The response should address the Veteran's lay statements concerning psychiatric stressor events and symptom history.

round 37, index 35: 
The response to this question must specifically address both of the claimed psychiatric diagnoses ( PTSD and MDD).

round 38, index 37:

round 39, index 32: 
The response to this question should address the Veteran's lay statements concerning psychiatric stressor events and symptom history.

round 40, index 34: 
As to any and each psychiatric disability diagnosed, is it at least as likely as not (a 50% or greater probability) that such disability pre-existed service and was permanently aggravated by (increased in severity during/due to) her military service or any event therein, to include the alleged incidents of hazing, harassment, and assault in 1981?

round 41, index 27: 
The response to this question must specifically address the claimed psychiatric diagnoses of PTSD and MDD.

round 42, index 15: 
The Court noted that such an evaluation was "undoubtedly pertinent to the appellant's claim" and found that the Board erred in "relying, in large part, on the examination that failed to address the etiology and history of the appellant's MDD."

round 43, index 26: 
As to each psychiatric disability entity diagnosed, is it at least as likely as not (a 50% or greater probability) that any symptoms shown during active duty military service were manifestations of the chronic psychiatric disability (i.e., is any chronic psychiatric diagnosis shown to have manifested during the Veteran's active duty military service)?

round 44, index 30: 
As to any and each psychiatric disability entity diagnosed, is it at least as likely as not (a 50% or greater probability) that such disability was caused by (or otherwise a consequence of) her military service or any event therein, to include the alleged incidents of hazing, harassment, and assault in 1981?

round 45, index 10:

round 46, index 16:

The response to this question should address the Veteran's lay statements concerning symptom history, as well as all other available pertinent information.

round 48, index 11: 
At present there are no additional documents pertinent to this appeal in Virtual VA.

round 49, index 40: 
(f) Are the Veteran's behavioral changes/disciplinary problems, noted in the latter part of her service and postservice, corroborating evidence that her alleged stressor events in service actually occurred?

round 50, index 39: 
Are her explanations why behavioral changes are not documented to a greater degree even though she was deeply affected by personal assaults consistent with what an individual might experience under these circumstances?

round 51, index 38: 
The examiner must explain the rationale for all opinions, to include comment on any credibility issues raised by the record (i.e., by conflicting reports).(e) Does the record reflect that during service the Veteran exhibited behavioral changes suggesting she was a victim of personal/sexual assault?

round 52, index 31:
