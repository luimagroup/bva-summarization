He also served on active duty from March 1972 to June 1979, except for an unspecified 20 months of inactive service during that period.

round 37, index 11: 
This letter noted that the Veteran's statement received in February 2008 did not provide VA with sufficiently detailed information.

round 38, index 16: 
Therefore, it does not appear that this evidence was considered when denying the Veteran's claim.

round 39, index 0: 
The Veteran served on active duty from August 1969 to March 1972 and from June 1979 to December 1991.
