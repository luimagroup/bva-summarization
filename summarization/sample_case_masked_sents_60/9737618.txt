Accordingly, the case is hereby REMANDED for the following actions:1.

round 5, index 31:

round 6, index 40: 
If the diagnosis of PTSD is deemed appropriate, the examiner should comment upon the link between the current symptomatology and one or more of the in-service stressors found to be established by the RO.

round 7, index 41: 
The report of examination should include the complete rationale for all opinions expressed.

round 8, index 25: 
If indicated, the RO should then schedule a VA psychiatric examination.

round 9, index 39: 
The examiner should integrate any previous psychiatric findings and diagnoses with current findings to obtain a true picture of the nature of the veteran's psychiatric status.

round 10, index 38: 
The examination report should reflect review of pertinent material in the claims folder.

round 11, index 9: 
A review of the record indicates that further development remains to be accomplished.

round 12, index 37: 
The RO must specify for the examiner the stressor or stressors that it has determined are established by the record and the examiner must be instructed that only those events may be considered for the purpose of determining whether exposure to a stressor in service has resulted in current psychiatric symptoms and, whether the diagnostic criteria to support the diagnosis of PTSD have been satisfied.

round 13, index 36: 
If, and only if, the RO determines that the record establishes the existence of a stressor or stressors, then the RO should arrange for the veteran to be accorded a VA psychiatric examination to determine the diagnosis of all psychiatric disorders that are present.

round 14, index 43: 
Related post- traumatic stress disorders, should be accomplished.

round 15, index 24: 
In view of the foregoing, it is the Boards judgment that the RO should obtain additional information from the veteran regarding his alleged in-service stressors and forward this information to the USASCRUR for verification of the stressors.

All necessary special studies or tests, to include psychological testing and evaluation, such as the Mississippi Scale for Combat-

round 21, index 32: 
The veteran is advised that this information is vitally necessary to obtain supportive evidence of the stressful events and that he must be as specific as possible because without such details an adequate search for verifying information cannot be conducted. 3.

round 22, index 45: 
The RO should then review the record and the claim should be readjudicated.

round 23, index 22: 
Likewise, if the examiner(s) render a diagnosis of PTSD that is not clearly based upon stressors in service whose existence the adjudicators have accepted, the examination would be inadequate for rating purposes.

round 24, index 33: 
With the additional information obtained and the evidence currently of record, the RO should review the file and prepare a summary of all the claimed stressors.

round 25, index 49: 
The purpose of this action is to comply with the holdings of the Court.

round 33, index 1: 
This case comes before the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 1995 RO rating decision which denied the veterans claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

round 34, index 55: 
BARBARA B. COPELAND	Member, Board of Veterans' AppealsUnder 38 U.S.C.A. § 7252 (West 1991), only a decision of the Board of Veterans' Appeals is appealable to the United States Court of Veterans Appeals.

round 35, index 48: 
The case should then be returned to the Board for further appellate review.

round 36, index 52: 
This claim must be afforded expeditious treatment by the RO.

round 37, index 50: 
The Board does not indicate any factual or legal conclusion as to any final outcomes warranted in the appeal.

round 38, index 10: 
In particular, although the RO sent information provided by the veteran in support of his stressors to the U.S. Army and Joint Services Environmental Support Group (ESG) [now renamed the U.S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records (USASCRUR)], it does not appear that a report of its findings has been associated with the claims file.

round 39, index 21: 
In other words, if the adjudicators determine that the existence of an alleged stressor or stressors in service is not established by the record, a medical examination to determine whether PTSD due to service is present is pointless.

round 40, index 20: 
In such a referral, the adjudicators should specify to the examiner(s) precisely what stressors have been accepted as established by the record, and the medical examiner(s) must be instructed that only those events may be considered in determining whether stressors to which the veteran was exposed during service were of sufficient severity as to have resulted in current psychiatric symptoms.

round 41, index 54:

round 43, index 3: 
A transcript of that hearing is on file.

round 44, index 13: 
In adjudicating a claim for service connection for PTSD, the Board is required to evaluate the supporting evidence in light of the places, types, and circumstances of service, as evidenced by the veteran's military records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence.

round 45, index 11: 
As information in addition to that which was already sent to the USASCRUR has now been added to the claims file, the Board has determined that the RO should forward to the USASCRUR any additional information regarding the veteran's unit of assignment, and his duties and responsibilities during his tour in Vietnam, and an account of his particularly stressful experiences.

round 46, index 23: 
Court set out guidelines for PTSD claims.

round 47, index 18: 
Upon reviewing Zarycki and West, it appears that in approaching a claim for service connection for PTSD, the question of the existence of an event claimed as a recognizable stressor must be resolved by adjudicatory personnel.

round 48, index 19: 
If the adjudicators conclude that the record establishes the existence of such a stressor or stressors, then, and only then, the case should be referred for a medical examination to determine the sufficiency of the stressor and whether the remaining elements required to support the diagnosis of PTSD have been met.

round 49, index 7: 
Through the course of his appeal, the veteran has asserted that certain stressful incidents which occurred while serving in Vietnam led to the development of PTSD.

round 50, index 16: 
In West, the Court held that the sufficiency of the stressor is a medical determination, and therefore adjudicators may not render a determination on this point in the absence of independent medical evidence.

round 51, index 2: 
The veteran testified at a personal hearing before a member of the Board on travel section at the RO in July 1997.

round 52, index 17: 
The Court also held in West that a psychiatric examination for the purpose of establishing the existence of PTSD was inadequate for rating purposes because the examiners relied, in part, on events whose existence the Board had rejected.

round 53, index 15: 
In Zarycki, the Court held that in addition to demonstrating the existence of a stressor, the facts must also establish that the alleged stressful event was sufficient to give rise to PTSD.

The claims file includes medical evidence showing a current diagnosis of PTSD.

round 55, index 0:

round 58, index 0: 
The veteran served on active duty with the Army from March 1964 to March 1966, including service in Vietnam from August 1965 to February 1966.
