Shane A. Durkin	Veterans Law Judge, Board of Veterans' AppealsUnder 38 U.S.C.A. § 7252 (West 2002), only a decision of the Board of Veterans' Appeals is appealable to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.

round 5, index 55: 
This remand is in the nature of a preliminary order and does not constitute a decision of the Board on the merits of your appeal.

round 6, index 49: 
If the benefit sought on appeal is not granted to the veteran's satisfaction, the RO or the AMC should issue to the veteran and his representative a supplemental statement of the case (to include a discussion of 38 C.F.R. § 3.655, if appropriate) and afford them the appropriate opportunity for response before the claims file is returned to the Board for further appellate consideration.

The RO or the AMC should also undertake any other development it determines to be warranted.

round 9, index 44:

The examiner should set forth the complete rationale for all opinions expressed and conclusions reached, in a typewritten report.

round 11, index 38: 
The claims file, to include a copy of this Remand, must be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner.

round 12, index 35: 
After providing the veteran with an opportunity to respond, the RO or the AMC should forward the veteran's pertinent stressor information of record (including copies of the veteran's service personnel records and a listing of alleged stressors) to the USASCURR and request that that organization attempt to verify the claimed stressors.

round 13, index 32: 
In light of these circumstances, the case is hereby REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC) in Washington, DC, for the following actions:

round 14, index 42: 
If PTSD is not diagnosed, the examiner should explain why the veteran does not meet the criteria for this diagnosis.

round 15, index 41: 
If PTSD is diagnosed, the examiner should identify the specific stressor(s) upon which the diagnosis is based.

round 16, index 40: 
Following examination of the veteran, review of his pertinent medical history, and with consideration of sound medical principles, the examiner should identify all currently present acquired psychiatric disorders.

round 17, index 37: 
Thereafter, the veteran should be afforded a VA psychiatric examination to confirm or rule out the presence of PTSD.

round 18, index 34: 
The veteran should be informed that dates within 60 days of the alleged stressors were needed in order to perform research.

round 19, index 48: 
Full reasons and bases for the determination must be provided.

round 20, index 36: 
If the veteran has not provided more specific dates for his alleged stressors, the RO or AMC should break the time period from January 1973 through September 1973 into 60-day search periods for USASCURR.

round 21, index 20:

The RO or AMC should request the veteran to provide more specific dates for his alleged stressors.

If the veteran fails to report to any scheduled examination, the RO should obtain and associate with the record any notice(s) of the examination(s) sent to the veteran.

round 25, index 30: 
The Board regrets any further delay in this case.

round 26, index 39: 
The examination and the report thereof should be in accordance with DSM-IV.

round 27, index 26: 
Therefore, the Board finds that the RO should once again schedule the veteran for a VA psychiatric examination.

round 28, index 31: 
However, the Board concludes that additional development of the record is required prior to appellate disposition.

round 29, index 25: 
In Connolly v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 566 (1991), the Court held that if VA failed to explain to the veteran the importance of a definitive diagnosis and thus failed to give the veteran the opportunity to make an informed decision regarding whether to undergo additional examination, then VA violated its duty to assist.

round 30, index 27: 
Because of the veteran's failure to cooperate in the past, he is hereby advised that failure to report to any scheduled VA examination, without good cause, may well result in a denial of his claim.

round 38, index 9: 
Although the RO issued a rating decision denying service connection for paranoid schizophrenia with hallucinations in May 2005, the issue of whether new and material evidence has been received to reopen a claim for service connection for depression has not been developed for appellate review.

round 40, index 24: 
Also in the August 2005 informal hearing presentation, the veteran's representative maintained that, although the veteran had failed to report for the December 2004 VA examination, he had not been specifically advised of the consequences (under 38 C.F.R. § 3.655) of his refusal to undergo further VA medical examinations.

round 41, index 19: 
In December 2004, the veteran failed to report for a scheduled VA PTSD examination.

round 42, index 18:

round 46, index 8:

round 47, index 17: 
The RO indicated that, according to the veteran, all the alleged stressors occurred during 1973.

round 48, index 6: 
Although the RO characterized the issue as entitlement to service connection for depression, the SOC cited 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a) and the RO stated that no new and material evidence had been submitted to reopen the veteran's previously denied claim.

round 49, index 7: 
Thereafter, in a statement received by the RO in April 2001, the veteran stated that he did not wish to pursue an appeal of this issue.

round 50, index 21: 
The representative also submitted a record recounting the deployments of the U.S.S. Constellation along with a waiver of RO consideration of the additional evidence (see 38 C.F.R. § 20.1304(c) (effective October 4, 2004).

round 56, index 0: 
The veteran served on active duty from September 1972 to September 1973.
