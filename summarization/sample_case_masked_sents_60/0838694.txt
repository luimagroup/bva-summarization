Service personnel records note that she requested, and was approved for, early separation from service due to pregnancy.

round 19, index 11:

round 20, index 12: 
however, because the benefit sought is being granted, there is no reason to belabor its impact in this matter.        II. Legal Criteria, Evidence and AnalysisInitially, the Board notes all of the evidence in the veteran's claims file, with an emphasis on the evidence relevant to this appeal, has been reviewed.

round 21, index 20: 
In her October 2002 claim of service connection for PTSD, the appellant alleged that she was beaten and raped on numerous occasions in service, and that the Army did nothing to discourage it.

round 22, index 21: 
In her stressor statement she further reiterated that J. M., the soldier committing the abuse (and father of her child), physically, sexually and mentally abused her, even while she was pregnant.

round 23, index 30: 
The Board finds no reason in the record to question the competence of that VA care-provider.

round 24, index 22: 
She stated that she was not allowed to seek medical help while in the military because J. M. (who was then a married noncommissioned officer who was superior to her) prevented it.

Letters from J. M. in essence acknowledge that he gravely mistreated the veteran.

round 26, index 3: 
A transcript of the hearing is associated with the claims file.

round 27, index 31: 
The Board recognizes that the veteran was subjected to sexual abuse trauma prior to service and has (apparently) experienced abuse since.

round 28, index 26: 
Based on history elicited and mental status evaluation, the examiner provided an Axis I diagnosis of PTSD, and opined that the veteran has PTSD from physical, sexual, and mental abuse she incurred while she was in the military.

round 29, index 28: 
Her accounts of sexual and mental abuse in the military by a married noncommissioned officer are, in essence, corroborated by the fact that she bore the child of that individual, and by his letters acknowledging abuse.
