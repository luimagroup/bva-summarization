round 0, index 35: 
Then, the case should be returned to the Board for further appellate review.

round 4, index 23: 
Therefore, the case is REMANDED to the RO for the following development:1.

round 5, index 25: 
The RO should then ask the veteran to provide a detailed written account (including dates, locations, names of other persons involved, unit designations, etc.) of the alleged service stressors for PTSD.

round 6, index 31: 
PTSD should be diagnosed or ruled out in accordance with the standards of DSM-IV.

round 7, index 32: 
If PTSD is diagnosed, the doctor should clearly identify the claimed events which are considered stressors supporting the diagnosis, and the doctor should fully explain why the stressors are considered sufficient under the standards of DSM-IV.

round 8, index 33: 
Thereafter, the RO should review the claim for service connection for PTSD.

round 9, index 24: 
The RO should obtain, from the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), service personnel records of the veteran concerning his Air Force active duty.  2.

round 10, index 30: 
The claims folder must be provided to and reviewed by the examiner.

round 11, index 29: 
Following completion of the above development, the veteran should be afforded a VA psychiatric examination concerning claimed PTSD.

round 12, index 27: 
The RO should have the veteran identify (names, addresses, dates) all sources of VA or non-VA treatment or examination for any psychiatric disorder since 1997.

round 13, index 28: 
The RO should then contact the sources and obtain copies of the related medical records, which are not already on file.

round 14, index 12: 
A July 1995 VA psychological outpatient treatment record shows that the veteran reported that during active Air Force service, he was stationed in Greece as a communications specialist and was responsible for sending out the coordinates for sites which were to be bombed in Vietnam.

round 15, index 26: 
The RO should forward the veterans statement (along with copies of his service personnel records and any other relevant evidence) to the USASCRUR, and request that organization investigate and attempt to verify the alleged stressors.

round 16, index 9: 
A review of his DD Form 214 shows that his primary military occupational specialty was that of a Morse system operator, and does not indicate either that he was stationed in Vietnam or that he engaged in combat.

round 17, index 8: 
The veteran served on active duty in the Air Force from December 1970 to July 1972.

round 18, index 22: 
ongoing treatment records should be obtained.

round 19, index 11: 
The Board finds that such records should be obtained.

round 20, index 10: 
His service personnel records are not associated with the file.

round 21, index 16: 
Such records do not indicate the stressors on which such diagnoses were based.

round 22, index 19: 
The RO should obtain a statement from the veteran as to his claimed in-service stressors, and should then attempt to corroborate the statements of stressors with the U.S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records (USASCRUR).

round 23, index 20: 
The Board finds that a VA examination should be provided to ascertain whether there is a clear diagnosis of PTSD based on any verified in-service stressor.

round 24, index 21: 
The medical evidence indicates that the veteran has been receiving episodic private psychiatric treatment in recent years;

round 25, index 7: 
If the claimed stressor is related to combat, service department evidence that the veteran engaged in combat or that the veteran was awarded the Purple Heart, Combat Infantryman Badge, or similar combat citation will be accepted, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as conclusive evidence of the claimed in-service stressor.

round 26, index 6: 
In order to establish service connection for PTSD, there must be medical evidence establishing a clear diagnosis of the condition, credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred and a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.

round 27, index 18: 
Since the veteran did not engage in combat, his statements and testimony are inadequate to prove the occurrence of a stressor in service; such a stressor must be established by official service records or other credible supporting evidence.

round 28, index 5: 
Regardless of whether or not his claim is well grounded, the VA has an obligation to help him complete his application for benefits.

round 29, index 17: 
Service connection for PTSD has been denied by the RO partly on the grounds that there is no clear diagnosis of PTSD or credible evidence of an in-service stressor.

round 30, index 4: 
The veteran contends he has PTSD, which is attributable to traumatic experiences while serving in the Air Force in Greece during the Vietnam era.

round 31, index 1:

round 33, index 15:

round 34, index 2: 
An RO hearing was requested and scheduled, but the veteran canceled his hearing request, as indicated by the RO hearing officer in an October 1997 deferred rating decision.

round 35, index 3: 
In a July 1998 decision, the RO granted entitlement to non-service-connected disability pension benefits, and such issue is not on appeal.
