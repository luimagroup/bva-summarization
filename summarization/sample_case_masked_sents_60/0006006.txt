round 3, index 5: 
Claimed PTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by service.

round 4, index 4: 
During service, the veteran did not engage in combat, and there is no credible supporting evidence that a stressor, which might lead to PTSD, occurred during service.

round 5, index 6: 
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONI. Factual BackgroundThe veteran served on active duty in the Marine Corps from January 1965 to January 1969.

round 6, index 7: 
His service personnel records show he served in Vietnam from November 1965 to December 1966; his primary duty was that of a field radio operator.

round 7, index 8: 
The service records disclose no combat decorations or other evidence of combat.

round 8, index 9: 
His service medical records do not reflect any pertinent abnormalities, and his December 1968 separation examination notes a normal psychiatric system.

round 9, index 10: 
Outpatient treatment records from Health Services Associates show treatment beginning in 1986 for medical conditions, especially hypertension, chest pain, upper respiratory infections.

round 10, index 11:

round 13, index 51: 
II.

round 14, index 64: 
The veteran's claimed stressors include humiliating beatings inflicted on him by marine instructors in boot camp.

L. W. TOBIN	Member, Board of Veterans' Appeals

round 17, index 56: 
The above regulation was revised on June 18, 1999, effective March 7, 1997, to reflect the Court's holding in Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).

round 18, index 76: 
For the above reasons, the Board finds that the veteran has not proffered credible supporting evidence that his claimed service stressors, which might lead to PTSD, actually occurred.

round 19, index 75: 
Allegations of such criminal conduct demand more substantial proof than the contradictory reports by the veteran and his fellow soldier.

round 20, index 62: 
The Board concludes that the veteran did not engage in combat.

round 21, index 55: 
If a claimed stressor is related to combat, service department evidence that the veteran engaged in combat or that the veteran was awarded the Purple Heart, Combat Infantryman Badge, or similar combat citation will be accepted, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as conclusive evidence of a claimed service stressor.

round 22, index 72: 
The veteran, himself, has given the Board reason to question his veracity.

round 23, index 63: 
Therefore his assertions of service stressors are not sufficient to establish that they occurred; rather, his stressors must be established by service records or other credible supporting evidence.

round 24, index 12: 
He admitted to previous psychiatric care, including a hospital admission 2 years earlier.

round 25, index 58: 
If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.

round 26, index 57: 
The current version of the regulation provides that service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. ยง 4.125(a) [i.e., under the criteria of DSM-IV]; a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.

round 27, index 71: 
The discrepancies in the veteran's and the corroborating story are not the only basis to question the occurrence of the claimed stressor.

round 28, index 59: 
During the veteran's active duty he had service in Vietnam, but service records do not show he engaged in combat.

round 29, index 60: 
In some early 1990 treatment records, he reported significant combat experience, but in later correspondence, testimony, and treatment records he denies combat.

round 30, index 77: 
Without such stressor evidence, service connection for PTSD may not be granted.

round 31, index 61: 
Also his current diagnosis of PTSD is predicated on a claimed stressor unrelated to combat.

round 32, index 3: 
The case was returned to the Board in January 2000.

round 37, index 65: 
The veteran's own service records do not mention the stressors, and the service department recently could not verify the claimed stressors.

round 38, index 15: 
Later in April 1991 he reported that he had been in Vietnam, seen much combat, and had been jumpy ever since.

round 52, index 73:

round 53, index 34: 
He proffered the names of those that he accused.

round 54, index 74:
