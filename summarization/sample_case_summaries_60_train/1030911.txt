On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Indianapolis, Indiana.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The appellant had active service from July 1964 to July 1967.
Instead, the record must contain evidence that corroborates the Veteran's account as to the occurrence of the claimed stressor.
The evaluation was conducted by a VA psychiatrist, who tentatively diagnosed the appellant with PTSD.
He also reported that while working at an airfield, he had to remove dead bodies from helicopters into trucks to be transported back to the base.
The appellant's MOS and assigned principal duty in Vietnam indicate that his claimed stressor of fear of being killed or injured while on patrol or due to mortar attacks was consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the appellant's service, his lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
In sum, the appellant has been diagnosed as having PTSD, which was linked by a VA psychiatrist in December 2004 to a stressor of fear of death and injury during his service in Vietnam.
Resolving all doubt in the appellant's favor, the Board finds that the evidence of record is sufficient to support a finding of service connection for PTSD.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.
