On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Columbia, South Carolina.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active service from September 1995 to February 1996 and from December 2003 to March 2005.
As the Board has concluded that service connection is warranted for PTSD, further discussion of the VCAA is not necessary.
If a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.
