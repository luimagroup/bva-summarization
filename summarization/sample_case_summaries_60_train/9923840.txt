On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in New York, New York.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from October 1982 to March 1992.
The examiner apparently based the diagnosis of PTSD on the above unverified stressors reported by the veteran.
In an effort to assist the veteran in completing his claim for service connection for PTSD, the Board finds that additional development (including an attempt to verify claimed in-service stressors, and the other action outlined below) is warranted.
The RO should obtain any medical records of VA psychiatric treatment of the veteran at the Brooklyn VAMC and at the Vet Center at 25 Chapel Street since 1996.3.
Therefore, the case is REMANDED to the RO for the following development:1.
