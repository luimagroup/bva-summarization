On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in St. Paul, Minnesota.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active service from November 1971 to December 1975.
The claims file contains service treatment records (STRs), service personnel records, VA treatment records, and private treatment records.
While the Veteran had been diagnosed with acquired psychiatric disabilities, there is no indication that they are associated with an in-service event that was not willful misconduct, as discussed below in detail.
As such, the Board finds that the duties set forth in 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.103(c)(2) were satisfied and that the Board can adjudicate the claim based on the current record.
If the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, then, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
Corroborating evidence is not needed if the claimed in-service stressor is related to the Veteran's "fear of hostile military or terrorist activity."
He reported that when he was buying illegal drugs a person attempted to rob him at knife point.
Then, the Veteran, in a state of panic, cut the body open, put rocks inside it, and pushed it into a river.
At the December 1975 separation examination the examiner noted that the Veteran was normal from a psychiatric standpoint.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, is denied.
