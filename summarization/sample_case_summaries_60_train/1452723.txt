On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in St. Louis, Missouri.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from November 1968 to June 1971, and from September 1984 to February 2005.
The Board has carefully reviewed the record and concludes that there has been no identification of further available evidence not already of record.
The memorandum lists the attempts made to obtain the records.
In each case where a veteran is seeking service connection for any disability, due consideration shall be given to the places, types, and circumstances of such veteran's service as shown by such veteran's service record, the official history of each organization in which such veteran served, such veteran's medical records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence.
He stated that he was with MACV at the time of the combat.
The March 2012 VA examination report provides an Axis I diagnosis of PTSD.
The diagnoses of PTSD in the Veteran's VA treatment records and the March 2012 VA examination report do not corroborate that any stressor occurred.
The Board is not bound to accept the Veteran's uncorroborated account of his experiences.
In the absence of a showing of combat with the enemy or evidence of a verifiable stressor, the Board concludes that the Veteran has failed to satisfy the criteria for service connection for PTSD.
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
