Dunphy, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from December 1973 to \r\nDecember 1976.  \r\n\r\nIn a June 1997 decision, the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) denied service connection for a skin disorder, to \r\ninclude consideration of service connection based on Agent \r\nOrange exposure.  The issue of service connection for PTSD \r\nwas remanded to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \r\nRegional Office (RO) for further development.  That issue is \r\nonce more properly before the Board for action.    \r\n\r\nThe veteran has further contended that he should be awarded a \r\npermanent and total disability rating for pension purposes, \r\nalong with a special monthly pension.  These claims were \r\ndenied in a December 1998 rating action.  However, as these \r\nclaims have not been developed for appellate review, no \r\naction by the Board at this time is appropriate.  \r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The veteran's claim was remanded to the RO for, among \r\nother requests, to verify the veteran's claimed stressors.  \r\n\r\n2.  The veteran did not provide sufficient information to \r\nverify the stressors, and, while he was given ample notice \r\nthat additional information was required, he failed to \r\nprovide this information.  \r\n\r\n3.  An underlying stressor in service, which could have led \r\nto PTSD, has not been verified.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131, 5107 (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304 (f) (1999)\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nInitially, the Board finds that the veteran's claim is well \r\ngrounded within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a).  See \r\nMurphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 78, 81 (1990).  By this \r\nfinding, the Board means that the veteran has presented a \r\nclaim which is not implausible when the contentions and the \r\nevidence of record are viewed in the light most favorable to \r\nthe claim.  The Board is also satisfied that all relevant \r\nfacts have been properly and sufficiently developed.\r\n\r\nIn the June 1997 remand, the Board requested that that the \r\nveteran provide specific information with regard to the \r\nclaimed stressors, that the RO determine which stressors had \r\nbeen verified, that the RO secure all reports of outpatient \r\ntreatment, and that the RO schedule the veteran for a \r\ncompensation examination.  From its review of the claims \r\nfolder, the Board concludes that all requested actions have \r\nbeen completed, and that the veteran's claim is ready for \r\nreview.  Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1999)\r\n\r\nService connection for post-traumatic stress disorder \r\nrequires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in \r\naccordance with Sec. 4.125(a) of this chapter; a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence, between current symptoms and \r\nan in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that \r\nthe claimed in-service stressor occurred.  If the evidence \r\nestablishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy \r\nand the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the \r\nabsence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and \r\nprovided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the \r\ncircumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's \r\nservice, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the \r\noccurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f) (1999)\r\n\r\nThe evidence does not suggest, nor is it contended, that the \r\nveteran was in combat.  Thus, as an initial matter, the \r\nveteran must provide credible supporting evidence that the \r\nclaimed in service stressor actually occurred.  Here, the \r\nveteran has contended that he was involved in the disposition \r\nof unusable equipment and explosives, by exploding them.  As \r\na result of these explosions, civilians near the base stormed \r\nthe front gate, threatening harm to the Marine guards.  He \r\nalso contended that one of his friends was killed by falling \r\noff a bridge in March 1974.  In his personal hearing in May \r\n1996, he also indicated that a member of his platoon was \r\nkilled when some explosives ignited.  However, he did not \r\nrecall the name of either individual. \r\n\r\nThe Board further notes that after service, the veteran was \r\ninvolved in an automobile accident which resulted in him \r\nbecoming a quadriplegic.  Given that the accident took place \r\nafter service, it cannot be considered a stressor for the \r\npurpose of PTSD.  Moreover, this accident was considered to \r\nbe the result of willful misconduct, and, hence, on this \r\nbasis alone cannot be considered the basis for a grant of \r\nservice connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe veteran's statements, along with extracts from his \r\nservice records, were referred in June 1998 to the Marine \r\nCorps Personnel Management Support Branch (MMSB).  In a \r\nletter later in June, the MMSB replied that the information \r\nprovided by the veteran was insufficient to conduct any \r\nmeaningful research.  In particular, the veteran did not \r\nprovide the specific unit to which he was assigned, along \r\nwith additional information to verify the claimed stressors.  \r\n\r\nA review of the evidence of record does not verify the \r\nstressors reported by the veteran.  In a December 1998 \r\nsupplemental statement of the case (SSOC) the veteran was \r\ninformed of the problems encountered by the MMSB, but he did \r\nnot provide any additional information which could have been \r\nused to assist in verification of the claimed stressors.  \r\n\"The duty to assist is not always a one-way street.  If a \r\nveteran wishes help, he cannot passively wait for it in those \r\ncircumstances where he may or should have information that is \r\nessential in obtaining the putative evidence.\"  Wood v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991). \r\n\r\nThus, the Board must conclude that the veteran has not met \r\nthe initial requirement for service connection for PTSD, the \r\npresence of a verified stressor.  The Board has considered \r\nthat the veteran has been treated at VA medical facilities \r\nfor a disorder diagnosed as PTSD.  However, as noted, the \r\nveteran must meet all three criteria for a grant of service \r\nconnection for PTSD.  In the absence of a verified stressor, \r\none of these requirements, the veteran's claim must fail.  \r\n\r\nA review of the determinations made by the RO indicates that \r\nservice connection for PTSD was denied on a number of bases, \r\nincluding that the examining physicians concluded that the \r\nstressors the veteran reported were not of sufficient \r\nseverity to have led to PTSD.  The veteran's representative \r\nargued that this was not a requirement under DSM-IV.  \r\nHowever, as the Board in this decision denies service \r\nconnection for PTSD on the basis that a stressor had not been \r\nverified, the issue of whether this unverified stressor would \r\nhave been sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD is not \r\nfor Board review.  Moreover, on at least the August 1999 \r\nSSOC, the veteran was informed that the basis of the denial \r\nwas that the stressor had not been established.  Hence, the \r\nBoard finds that the current denial of service connection for \r\nPTSD was not on a differing basis from the RO, and that the \r\nveteran's due process rights are therefore not prejudiced.  \r\nBernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 393-94 (1993).\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is denied.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tV. L.

H.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nMichael J. Skaltsounis, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from August 1973 to November \r\n1974.\r\n\r\nInitially, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) notes that \r\nthis matter was previously remanded for the purpose of \r\naffording the veteran a requested hearing before a member of \r\nthe Board at the regional office (RO).  While in remand \r\nstatus, the veteran indicated that he instead wanted a \r\nhearing before a hearing officer at the RO.  The hearing was \r\nscheduled for February 2000, but the veteran failed to \r\nreport.  Therefore, the Board finds that the action requested \r\nby its previous remand has now been accomplished to the \r\nextent possible.  \r\n\r\nHowever, for reasons noted below, remand is now warranted \r\nbased on other considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nWhile this matter has been in remand status, the Board has \r\nlearned of a pending fraud investigation which is being \r\nconducted by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The veteran's claim \r\nfile is believed to contain information relevant to this \r\ninvestigation and OIG has requested that the claims file be \r\ntransferred to OIG in connection with a hearing scheduled for \r\nJuly 3, 2000, in the jurisdiction of the RO.  The Board is \r\nnot aware of the documents contained within the claims file \r\nwhich are relevant to the pending investigation.  \r\nConsequently, the Board finds that it would not be \r\nappropriate for the Board to proceed further in this matter \r\nuntil the investigation has been concluded and the results of \r\nthe investigation have been associated with the claims \r\nfolder.  The claims file will therefore be returned to the RO \r\nfor immediate transfer to OIG.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, to ensure full compliance with due process \r\nrequirements, the case is remanded to the RO for the \r\nfollowing development:\r\n\r\n1.  The appellant is advised that he has \r\nthe right to submit additional evidence \r\nand argument on the matter or matters the \r\nBoard has remanded to the regional \r\noffice.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. \r\nApp. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\n2.  Upon receipt of the claims folder, \r\nthe RO should take immediate steps to \r\nforward the claims folder to the OIG in \r\nconnection with a hearing currently \r\nscheduled for July 3, 2000.  The RO \r\nshould thereafter obtain any relevant \r\nreports reflecting the results of the \r\ninvestigation conducted by OIG and \r\nassociate those reports with the claims \r\nfolder.\r\n\r\n3.  After the completion of any \r\ndevelopment deemed appropriate in \r\naddition to that requested above, the RO \r\nshould readjudicate the issue of \r\nentitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD.\r\n\r\n4.  Thereafter, the RO should again \r\nreview the record.  If the benefits \r\nsought on appeal remain denied, the \r\nappellant and representative should be \r\nfurnished a supplemental statement of the \r\ncase and given the opportunity to respond \r\nthereto.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the case should be returned to the Board, if in \r\norder.  The Board intimates no opinion as to the ultimate \r\noutcome as to this issue.  The appellant need take no action \r\nuntil otherwise notified.\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment by the RO.  \r\nThe law requires that all claims that are remanded by the \r\nBoard or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans \r\nClaims (previously known as the United States Court of \r\nVeterans Appeals prior to March 1, 1999, hereafter \"the \r\nCourt\") for additional development or other appropriate \r\naction must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Jefferson, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from September 1965 to \r\nSeptember 1968.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nCompetent medical evidence of PTSD is not shown.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe claim of service connection for PTSD is not well \r\ngrounded.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a)(West 1991). \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe threshold question that must be resolved with respect to \r\nthe veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD is whether the claim is well grounded.  38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n5107(a) (West 1991); Murphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 78, 81 \r\n(1990).  A well-grounded claim is a plausible claim as \r\nmeritorious on its own or capable of substantiation. See \r\nMurphy, 1 Vet. App. at 81.  An allegation alone is not \r\nsufficient, the appellant must submit evidence in support of \r\nhis/her claim that would \"justify a belief by a fair and \r\nimpartial individual that the claim is plausible.\"  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 5.107(a) (West 1991); Tirpak v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. \r\nApp. 609, 611 (1992).\r\n\r\nIn order for a claim to be well grounded, there must be \r\ncompetent evidence of current disability (a medical \r\ndiagnosis); of incurrence or aggravation of a disease or \r\ninjury in service (lay or medical evidence); and of a nexus \r\nbetween inservice disease or injury and the current \r\ndisability (medical evidence).  Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. \r\n498 (1995).\r\n\r\nEstablishing service connection for PTSD requires a greater \r\nevidentiary showing than that necessary to well ground the \r\nclaim.  Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 4.125(a), a link, established by medical evidence, between \r\ncurrent symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed inservice stressor \r\nactually occurred.  If the evidence establishes that the \r\nveteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed \r\nstressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, \r\nand hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay \r\ntestimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed \r\nin-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f). \r\n\r\nService medical records show that in June 1967 the veteran \r\nwas referred to a psychiatric clinic for complaints about his \r\nbehavior that included violent acts such as fighting, \r\nreckless driving, and thievery.  The provisional diagnosis \r\nwas antagonistic behavior disorder.  The July 1967 \r\npsychiatric examination revealed that the veteran was \r\nemotionally unstable and immature.  The diagnosis was \r\nemotional unstable personality, chronic, severe, manifested \r\nby an inability to react properly. \r\n\r\nThe veteran's service medical records are negative for any \r\ntreatment concerning a sexual assault.  Service \r\nadministrative records show that the veteran lost rank and \r\nwas disciplined for infractions but are negative for any \r\ninformation concerning a sexual assault.  \r\n\r\nIn a VA Form 21-526, Veteran's Application for Compensation \r\nor Pension, received in March 1998, the veteran claimed that \r\nhe was sexually assaulted and drugged during service in early \r\nto middle 1967.  \r\n\r\nIn June 1998 the RO forwarded a letter requesting information \r\nfrom the veteran including the dates and places of his \r\nmilitary assignments and duties; to whom his claimed sexual \r\nassaulted was reported and if an investigation occurred; a \r\nlist of persons nearby during the assault and if there were \r\nany related events.  In conjunction with the letter the RO \r\nalso forwarded to the veteran a PTSD information support \r\nform.  \r\n\r\nA letter from a clinical coordinator at a Vet Center was \r\nreceived in October 1998.  It was stated that the veteran had \r\nreceived treatment from the Vet Center since 1986, and that \r\nhis primary therapist had left the agency.  The veteran had \r\njoined a therapy group to improve his relationship with men, \r\nwhich had become strained and fearful since a rape had \r\noccurred in service.  The veteran had questions about his own \r\nsexual identity, fears of being considered homosexual, and a \r\nfear of an actual assault. \r\n\r\nThe Vet Center excerpts from January through March 1998 chart \r\nnotes reveal that the veteran discussed his feelings about \r\nthe reported rape that he was subjected to during service and \r\nhis feelings about men.  He stated that by keeping the \r\ncircumstances surrounding his rape in service secret, he had \r\ncreated a block in his ability to fully and comfortably live \r\nhis life.  It was stated that during service the veteran was \r\ndrugged and raped by two men, one of which had passed himself \r\noff as being friendly to the veteran.  Subsequent to \r\nreporting the rape to his superior officers, it was stated \r\nthat the veteran was labeled a homosexual, lost rank, and was \r\npersecuted.  \r\n\r\nThe evidence shows that while the veteran received a \r\npsychiatric evaluation during service, his problems were \r\nclinically assessed as emotional unstable personality.  It is \r\nimportant to note that under the laws and regulations of VA, \r\npersonality disorders are not considered disabilities for \r\nwhich compensation may be awarded.  38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.303(c)(1999).  Regulatory authority provides that \r\npersonality disorders will not be considered as disabilities \r\nunder terms of the rating schedule.  38 C.F.R. �� 4.9, 4.127 \r\n(1999).  \r\n\r\nWhile evidence has been submitted in support of the veteran's \r\nclaim of PTSD, close scrutiny of the evidence shows that it \r\nis negative for a diagnosis of PTSD.  The October 1998 \r\nstatement from the Vet Center shows that the veteran \r\napparently received counseling in the past, wherein he \r\napparently discussed the reported sexual assault that \r\noccurred during service.  However, the statement indicates \r\nthat the counseling was primarily for educational and coping \r\nskills, and it was conducted by clinician no longer at the \r\nfacility.  Lay evidence of a sexual assault sufficient for \r\nthe service incurrence requirement for a well-grounded clam \r\nhas been received.  See Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272, 277 \r\n(1999).  However, there is absolutely no indication from the \r\nrecord that the veteran has received treatment for PTSD.  In \r\nfact PTSD has not been reported as a diagnosis at all.  \r\n\r\nWhile it has been asserted that the veteran has PTSD, where \r\nthe determinative issue involves medical causation, it has \r\nbeen held that competent medical evidence that a claim is \r\n\"plausible\" is required in order for the claim to be well \r\ngrounded.  See Kirwin v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 148 (1995); \r\nGrivois v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 136, 140 (1994); Grottveit v. \r\nBrown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 (1993).  Lay testimony is \r\ninsufficient to fulfill the burden because lay persons \r\ngenerally lack the expertise necessary to opine on matters \r\ninvolving medical knowledge. Kirwin, 8 Vet. App. at 152; \r\nGrivois, 6 Vet. App. at 140; Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. \r\nApp. 492, 494 (1992).  In this regard, it must be stated that \r\nany lay assertions concerning medical causation offered by \r\nthe veteran are not considered competent.  As indicated \r\nbefore, there is no competent medical evidence of PTSD and \r\nalso no evidence of medical causation or an etiological \r\nrelationship concerning PTSD and service.  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is denied.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tJohn E.

Service connection may also be granted for any \r\ndisease or injury diagnosed after discharge when all the \r\nevidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes \r\nthat the disease or injury was incurred in service.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (1999).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between \r\nthe current symptoms and an inservice stressor; and credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed inservice stressor \r\noccurred.  If the evidence establishes that the veteran \r\nengaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is \r\nrelated to that combat, in the absence of clear and \r\nconvincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the \r\nclaimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, \r\nconditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the \r\nveteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of \r\nthe claimed stressor.  See, 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1999).\r\n\r\nWhen, after consideration of all the evidence of record, \r\nthere is an approximate balance of positive and negative \r\nevidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the \r\ndetermination of the matter or a reasonable doubt arises \r\nregarding service origin, the degree of disability or any \r\nother point, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such \r\nissue shall be given to the claimant.  By reasonable doubt is \r\nmeant one which exists because of an approximate balance of \r\nthe positive and the negative evidence which does not \r\nsatisfactorily prove or disprove the claim.  It is a \r\nsubstantial doubt and one within the range of probability, as \r\ndistinguished from pure speculation or remote possibility.  \r\nThe reasonable doubt doctrine is also applicable even in the \r\nabsence of official records, particularly if the basic \r\nincident allegedly arose under combat, or similarly strenuous \r\nconditions, and is consistent with the probable results of \r\nsuch known hardships.  See, 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b) (West \r\n1991); and 38 C.F.R. � 3.102 (1999).\r\n\r\nThe \"benefit of the doubt doctrine\" requires a veteran only \r\nto demonstrate that there is an approximate balance of \r\npositive and negative evidence in order to prevail; \r\nentitlement need not be established beyond a reasonable \r\ndoubt, by clear and convincing evidence or by a fair \r\npreponderance of the evidence.  In other words, the \r\npreponderance of the evidence must be against the claim for \r\nbenefits to be denied.  When a veteran seeks benefits and the \r\nevidence is in relative equipoise, the law dictates that the \r\nveteran prevails.  This \"unique standard of proof\" is in \r\nkeeping with the high esteem in which our nation holds those \r\nwho have served in the Armed Services.  It is in recognition \r\nof our debt to our veterans that society has, through \r\nlegislation, taken upon itself the risk of error when, in \r\ndetermining whether a veteran is entitled to benefits, there \r\nis an \"approximate balance of positive and negative \r\nevidence.\"  By tradition and by statute, the benefit of the \r\ndoubt belongs to the veteran.   See, Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 \r\nVet. App. 49, 54 (1990).\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the veteran contends that he experienced \r\ntraumatic events while serving in combat in the Republic of \r\nVietnam during the Vietnam era, and that these experiences \r\ntriggered the onset of his PTSD, which has caused industrial \r\nand social impairment, and has prompted multiple VA \r\npsychiatric admissions throughout the years.  The Board notes \r\nthat the veteran is a combat veteran, and that he has claimed \r\ncombat stressors that are credible, and consistent with the \r\ncircumstances, conditions and hardships of his service.  \r\nTherefore, there is no need to accomplish additional \r\ndevelopment to attempt to verify the claimed stressors, to \r\nwhich further reference will be made later in this decision.  \r\nAlso, since there is competent evidence in the record showing \r\nmultiple diagnoses of PTSD, as well as lay evidence \r\nsuggesting a nexus between the PTSD and the inservice \r\nstressors, the Board finds that the veteran has submitted a \r\nclaim for service connection for PTSD that is well grounded \r\nor capable of substantiation, in accordance with the \r\nprovisions of 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a) (West 1991), and Murphy \r\nv. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 78 (1990).  The Board also notes \r\nthat the facts relevant to this appeal have been properly \r\ndeveloped, and that VA's obligation to assist the veteran in \r\nthe development of his claim has been fully satisfied.  Id.\r\n\r\nThe service medical records in the file reveal that, while a \r\npsychiatric disability was not diagnosed on discharge, the \r\nveteran indicated, in the report of medical history for \r\nseparation purposes that he filled out and signed in \r\nSeptember 1970, that he had had, or currently had, trouble \r\nsleeping, as well as nervous troubles of some sort.  In \r\nSeptember 1972, he had his first VA psychiatric admission \r\nand, while the diagnosis was listed as schizophrenia, \r\nundifferentiated type, it was noted in that record that the \r\nveteran reported that he had felt strange, easily irritable, \r\nwithdrawn, and with a general apathy and lack of interest for \r\neverything since being discharged from active military \r\nservice.  He also reported terrifying nightmares, which would \r\nwake him up, as well as homicidal and suicidal ideations, all \r\nhaving started shortly after service.\r\n\r\nThe record contains opinions from several VA mental health \r\nspecialists indicating that either the criteria for a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD are not fulfilled in this case, or that \r\ndiagnoses other than PTSD, such as depression, dysthymia, and \r\nalcohol dependence, are warranted instead.  In this regard, \r\nit is noted that, according to a December 1990 VA psychiatric \r\nexamination report, the veteran had a post-service medical \r\nhistory that included admissions with diagnoses of \r\nschizophrenia, undifferentiated type, alcohol dependence, by \r\nhistory, rule-out PTSD, and PTSD.  The veteran was examined, \r\nbut it was noted that his thought content dealt mostly with \r\n\"description of some depressive symptomatology,\" although \r\nthe veteran did describe having memories from Vietnam, \r\n\"becoming rather depressed when he starts thinking about \r\nthis, unable to sleep, and also ... irritable and sometimes \r\nlosing control of his impulses.\"  The subscribing examiners \r\nlisted depressive disorder, not otherwise specified, and \r\nsubstance (alcohol) abuse, by record, as the diagnoses in \r\nAxis I, and explained that they had found no evidence to make \r\na diagnosis of PTSD, although the veteran did show \"some \r\nfeatures of the condition, but this is not enough to comply \r\nwith DSM-III diagnostic requirements.\"\r\n\r\nIn August 1992, the veteran was again examined by VA mental \r\nhealth specialists, and, while a depressive disorder and \r\nalcohol dependence, in remission, were again diagnosed, it \r\nwas again noted that the veteran complained of recalling \r\ninservice stressful events, such as witnessing a fellow \r\nsoldier who fell from a helicopter, and killing four \r\nVietnamese with a grenade.  In November 1993, he was again \r\nexamined by the VA psychiatrist who conducted the December \r\n1990 psychiatric examination, but, again, it was noted that \r\n\"[i]t is our opinion that this veteran's condition and \r\nsymptoms do not fulfill [the] criteria for a diagnosis of \r\nP[TSD] and that his correct psychiatric diagnosis should be \r\nthat of Dysthymia.\"  This psychiatrist thereafter re-\r\nexamined the veteran in July 1998, and indicated that \"the \r\ndiagnosis will remain as stated,\" while the VA psychiatrist \r\nwho examined the veteran in August 1992 diagnosed once again, \r\nin July 1998, a depressive disorder and alcohol abuse, in \r\nremission.  It was implied, in these reports of July 1998, \r\nthat alcohol intake might be a component of the veteran's \r\npsychiatric problems, but it was thereafter clarified in them \r\nthat a \"urine ethanol level test was found negative.\"\r\n\r\nAll of the above notwithstanding, the Board notes that the \r\nrecord also contains, as indicated earlier in this decision, \r\nmultiple diagnoses of PTSD, all rendered by VA mental health \r\nspecialists.  In this regard, the Board notes that, according \r\nto an April 1988 VA psychological examination report, the \r\nveteran complained of headaches, loss of energy, sleeping \r\ndifficulties, nightmares, and anger outbursts.   He \r\nacknowledged that at times his behavior became unintelligible \r\nto himself and others, since he appeared to behave as if he \r\nwere still in the war.  The veteran was not able to elaborate \r\nmuch on this, and only discussed an instance in which he \r\nappeared to have a visual hallucination, but his wife did \r\ndiscuss various instances in which he appeared to have been \r\nexperiencing flashbacks.  For example, she said that, on two \r\noccasions, he had requested that his wife run over an \r\nindividual because \"he was a Vietnamese.\"  At those times, \r\nhe would usually tear off a piece of his clothing, would wrap \r\nit around his head, and would then start referring to himself \r\nas a soldier who had been \"commanded to destroy the enemy.\"  \r\nWhen his spouse refused to comply with his requests, he would \r\nbecome angry and would start screaming at her, saying that \r\nshe should follow orders, \"or all of them would die.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the above report, the veteran's anxiety level \r\nappeared to be moderate to severe, but he was in contact with \r\nreality and there was no apparent evidence of a perceptual \r\nand/or thought disorder.  The theme of war and death, \r\nhowever, appeared to occupy most of his conscious thinking, \r\nbut these thoughts were seldom acknowledged for fear of \r\ndisorganization.  In the examiner's opinion, \"[t]he result \r\nof this evaluation supports the diagnosis of P[TSD].\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, the vast majority of the multiple \r\nVA psychiatric admissions of the veteran throughout the years \r\nhave included a diagnosis of PTSD.  For instance, the Board \r\nnotes that, in May 1990, the veteran had a one-day admission \r\ndue to complaints of auditory hallucinations, depression, \r\nnightmares, insomnia, poor control of his impulses, suicidal \r\nideas, anorexia, and frequent crying.  He was noted to be \r\nsad, depressed, with low self-esteem, with accusatory \r\nideations, guilt feelings and death wishes, his main topic of \r\nconcern being about Vietnam experiences and flashbacks.  It \r\nwas noted that the veteran had attended a VA PTSD group, and \r\nthat, in the subscribing physician's opinion, he was \"a \r\nseverely disabled veteran that is unemployable.\"  Major \r\ndepression and PTSD were both diagnosed, and similar \r\ndiagnoses were rendered in August 1990 (after a 43-day VA \r\npsychiatric admission), March 1991 (after a 28-day \r\npsychiatric admission), June 1991 (after a 22-day psychiatric \r\nadmission), March 1992 (after a 21-day psychiatric \r\nadmission), June 1992 (after a 37-day admission), August 1992 \r\n(after a 29-day psychiatric admission), October 1992 (after a \r\n23-day psychiatric admission), and April 1993 (after a 22-day \r\nadmission).  Similar diagnoses were also rendered pursuant to \r\nVA admissions in 1995, 1996 and 1997, and the Board notes \r\nthat this pattern suggests that there may have been \r\nadditional, more recent psychiatric admissions in this case, \r\nwith the same diagnoses.\r\n\r\nThe most recent VA discharge summary in the file, which \r\nreveals a 21-day psychiatric admission starting in February \r\n1997, is illustrative of the contents of the above mentioned \r\nhospitalization reports.  According to this report, the \r\nveteran was admitted due to his having become increasingly \r\nirritable, destructive and aggressive.  The veteran \r\ncomplained of ideas of aggression, fear of losing control of \r\nhis aggressive impulses, anhedonia, anorexia, \"command-\r\ntype\" auditory hallucinations telling him to kill himself \r\nand to \"help us,\" helicopter sounds and nightmares about an \r\nincident in Vietnam in which he was hurt by a mine-like \r\nweapon.  He also reported sadness, insomnia and isolation \r\ntendencies, and said that he was mad at a helicopter that had \r\nflown over his house.  Depression, not otherwise specified, \r\nand PTSD, chronic, were diagnosed, and the veteran was \r\neventually discharged after the exacerbation of his symptoms \r\nwas controlled by medication and mental health therapy.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, the record shows that the veteran is a combat \r\nveteran, who has reported stressful inservice experiences, \r\nand he has had multiple hospitalizations in which he has \r\nreported symptoms arising from those inservice experiences.  \r\nA question has arisen as to whether he indeed suffers from \r\nPTSD.  Insofar as the remaining criteria set forth in \r\n� 3.304(f) for a grant of service connection for PTSD have \r\nbeen met, the answer to this question will determine whether \r\nthe benefits sought on appeal are warranted in this case.  As \r\nclearly shown in the above discussion of the pertinent \r\ncompetent evidence of record, several mental health experts \r\nhave said that the veteran does not meet the criteria for a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD, while other mental health experts, \r\nparticularly those who have treated the veteran during his \r\nmultiple psychiatric hospitalizations, have indicated that \r\nthe veteran indeed suffers from PTSD.  The Board then finds \r\nthat the evidence as to whether the veteran has PTSD or not \r\nis in relative equipoise.  Therefore, resolving reasonable \r\ndoubt in favor of the veteran, the Board concludes that \r\nservice connection for PTSD is warranted.\r\n \r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tJEFF MARTIN\r\n\tMember, Board of Veterans' Appeals\r\n\r\n \r\n- 8 -\r\n\r\n\r\n- 1 -\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"5bec3ad78102470b4a111761","name":"0010647.txt","plainText":"Citation Nr: 0010647\t\r\nDecision Date: 04/21/00    Archive Date: 04/28/00\r\n\r\nDOCKET NO.  92-24 064\t)\tDATE\r\n\t)\r\n\t)\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in St. \r\nPetersburg, Florida\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for a heart disorder, \r\nincluding as secondary to service-connected PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nAppellant represented by:\tVeterans of Foreign Wars of \r\nthe United States\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nRichard E. Coppola, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active, honorable service with the United \r\nStates Coast Guard from July 1948 to July 1954.  \r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal of rating decisions from the St. Petersburg, \r\nFlorida, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office \r\n(RO).  The Board remanded this case in November 1991, April \r\n1993 and February 1998 to accomplish additional development.  \r\nIn the February 1998 decision, the Board denied claims of \r\nservice connection for residuals of a right shoulder injury, \r\nresiduals of a right hand injury, and a neck disorder and \r\ngranted a 30 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder \r\n(PTSD).  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThere is no competent evidence that any currently diagnosed \r\nheart disorder is of service origin, was first manifested \r\nduring within one year after service, or is otherwise related \r\nto the active service, or that such was caused or permanently \r\nworsened by service-connected PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for \r\na heart disorder, including as secondary to service-connected \r\nPTSD, is not well-grounded.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a) (West \r\n1991).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFactual Background\r\n\r\nThe service medical records reflect that on the July 1948 \r\nservice entrance examination the veteran's heart and blood \r\nvessels were normal.  The report of a July 1951 reenlistment \r\nexamination shows that the veteran's heart and vascular \r\nsystem were normal, as was a chest x-ray examination.  On the \r\nJuly 1954 service discharge examination the veteran's heart \r\nand vascular system were normal.  His blood pressure was \r\n118/72, 116/70 and 120/74.  A chest x-ray examination was \r\nalso normal.  The service medical records do not contain a \r\ndiagnosis of any heart disorder.  \r\n\r\nThe initial post-service medical evidence is a private \r\nmedical record dated in April 1976, at which time a review of \r\nsystems revealed that the veteran reported occasional \r\npalpitations of very short duration but he denied chest pain, \r\nhypertension and other potential cardiovascular symptoms.  \r\nPhysical and x-ray examinations were normal.  In July 1977, \r\nthe veteran complained of a two-week history of chest pain.  \r\nThe impression was chest wall pain.  The medical records show \r\nongoing follow-up and treatment for palpitations and chest \r\npain 9often referred to as chest wall or musculoskeletal \r\npain) through 1992.  Multiple records from that time period \r\nreflect the complaints of problems with worrying and \r\nnervousness in addition to cardiac complaints.  By 1984 the \r\nveteran was noted to have adult onset diabetes mellitus.  A \r\nrecord dated in February 1985 includes notation that the \r\nveteran had had an episode of syncope in October 1984, with \r\nsubsequent episodes of irregular heartbeats and palpitations, \r\nmost likely occurring during periods of stress.  The \r\nimpression was palpitations.  The examining physician stated \r\nthat it was difficult to tell whether the veteran's \r\npalpitations were pathologic or just due to anxiety.  In \r\nMarch 1985 and subsequently there were impressions of \r\nparoxysmal atrial fibrillation.  A February 1992 record \r\nindicates that the veteran complained of palpitations while \r\nwearing a Holter monitor; however, there was no evidence of \r\narrhythmia per the monitor and there were very few premature \r\natrial or ventricular contractions noted during that time.  \r\nThese private medical records include diagnoses of chest wall \r\npain, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, history of syncope, \r\nepisodes of syncope, a history of supraventricular \r\ntachycardia, possible vasovagal syncope and paroxysmal \r\nsupraventricular tachycardia.  This physician did not relate \r\nany of these diagnoses to service or as secondary to the \r\nveteran's service-connected disabilities.  A December 1991 \r\nletter from the veteran's treating physician notes that he \r\nhad been treating the veteran since 1976 for various problems \r\nincluding paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.  \r\n\r\nThe claims file contains a letter dated in December 1986, in \r\nwhich M.G., M.D., related treatment and evaluation of the \r\nveteran for a 10-to-12 month history of syncopal-like \r\nepisodes.  Dr. M.G. noted that the veteran provided a history \r\nof similar symptoms in the 1960s, and that the veteran stated \r\nthat such were relieved by treatment to include \r\nantidepressive medication.  After examination, Dr. M.G. \r\nconcluded that there did not seem to be a neurologic etiology \r\nfor the veteran's syncope-like episodes.  Dr. M.G. continued \r\nto note that the veteran did exhibit symptoms of major \r\ndepression and stress and that further psychiatric treatment \r\nwas recommended.  A review of records from the 1960s reveals \r\nno notations of any reported cardiac symptomatology or any \r\ncardiac findings in connection with treatment for depressive \r\nepisodes.\r\n\r\nThe veteran underwent a VA examination in August 1990.  He \r\ncomplained of an irregular heartbeat, palpitations, \r\ndepression, fatigue and shortness of breath.  Cardiac \r\nexamination revealed that the heart was not enlarged.  The \r\nveteran's heart rhythm was regular with good sounds, and all \r\nperipheral vessels appeared intact.  Blood pressure readings, \r\nseated, recumbent, standing and before and after exercise \r\nranged from 110 to 150 systolic and from 80 to 90 diastolic.  \r\nThe examiner included a diagnosis of a history of cardiac \r\narrhythmia with palpitation; no etiology was specified.  \r\n\r\nBy a June 1992 rating decision service connection was granted \r\nfor PTSD and a 10 percent rating was assigned, effective May \r\n14, 1990.\r\n\r\nIn August 1995, the veteran was hospitalized because of \r\nadenocarcinoma of the prostate.  He underwent a radical \r\nretropubic prostatectomy during that time.  The discharge \r\ndiagnoses included paroxysmal atrial tachycardia and \r\nfibrillation.  The veteran was hospitalized in September 1995 \r\nbecause he experienced recurrent paroxysmal supraventricular \r\ntachyarrhythmias associated with shortness of breath, \r\nweakness and chest discomfort.  He underwent chest x-ray and \r\nan echocardiogram.  The discharge diagnoses were paroxysmal \r\natrial fibrillation, which was described as idiopathic, and \r\nmitral valve prolapse.  \r\n\r\nThe evidence shows the veteran was hospitalized in April 1996 \r\nbecause of recurrent chest pain.  He was experiencing \r\nunstable angina pectoris and was admitted to rule out \r\nmyocardial infarction.  He underwent an electrocardiogram and \r\ncardiac catheterization.  The impression was coronary artery \r\ndisease with a recent inferior myocardial infarction.  The \r\nveteran then underwent coronary artery bypass surgery.  The \r\ndischarge diagnoses were recent inferior myocardial \r\ninfarction and coronary artery disease.  During follow-up \r\nexamination and treatment in May 1996 the diagnosis was \r\nsevere coronary artery disease and paroxysmal atrial \r\nfibrillation.  \r\n\r\nThe medical records show that the veteran continued to have \r\natrial fibrillation.  Subsequently, in August 1996, he was \r\nhospitalized for dual chamber pacemaker implantation and \r\natrioventricular node ablation.  The evidence shows the \r\nveteran underwent periodic follow-up examinations through \r\n1998.  The additional impressions included mitral \r\nregurgitation, valvular heart disease, mild aortic \r\ninsufficiency and ventricular abnormalities and hypertrophy.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran has argued that his heart condition was caused by \r\nthe symptoms associated with his service-connected \r\npsychiatric disorder.  In February 1998, the Board remanded \r\nthe issue of service connection for a heart disorder to the \r\nRO, in part to obtain a competent medical opinion addressing \r\nthe issue whether the veteran's his service-connected \r\npsychiatric disorder caused any existing cardiac pathology or \r\naggravated any underlying cardiac pathology.  The Board noted \r\nthat the evidence of record at the time of the remand did not \r\ninclude competent medical evidence indicating the etiology of \r\nthe veteran's cardiac symptomatology.  \r\n\r\nBy a March 1998 rating decision, the RO implemented the \r\nBoard's grant of a 30 percent rating for PTSD and assigned an \r\neffective date of April 12, 1994. \r\n\r\nOf record is the report of a VA examination in May 1998.  The \r\nexaminer, Dr. A., reported a history of the veteran's \r\nsymptoms and treatment, including coronary artery disease \r\nwith myocardial infarction in 1996 and the subsequent \r\ncoronary artery bypass surgery and pacemaker installation.  \r\nPhysical examination showed the heart was normal without any \r\ngallop, murmur, or rub.  Electrocardiogram revealed a paced \r\nrhythm.  Chest x-ray examination was normal.  The impression \r\nwas history of coronary artery disease with left-sided \r\natypical chest pain for angina, which was most likely \r\nmusculoskeletal pain, and shortness of breath.  The examiner \r\nnoted that the veteran was not in congestive heart failure, \r\nbut recommended additional testing to rule out any remote \r\npossibility of ischemia causing the chest pain and to \r\nevaluate left ventricular systolic function.  \r\n\r\nIn an October 1998 statement the veteran alleged that Dr. A., \r\nwho reportedly had the claim file, had only asked the veteran \r\nto sign a form and had not examined him, or taken his blood \r\npressure or done anything else.  \r\n\r\nIn November 1998 the veteran underwent an echocardiogram.  \r\nThe impression was calcification of the aortic valve with \r\nminimal aortic insufficiency, minimal mitral regurgitation, \r\nmild tricuspid regurgitation and regional wall motion \r\nabnormalities with a mild decrease in left ventricular \r\nsystolic function.  The veteran underwent a stress test \r\nseveral days later.  The impression was coronary artery \r\ndisease involving the left anterior descending artery with \r\nmild active ischemia.  \r\n\r\nIn July 1999 the RO returned the claims folder to the VA \r\nMedical Center in order to obtain a medical opinion on the \r\nquestions raised in the Board's February 1998 remand \r\ndecision.  \r\n\r\nThe September 1999 report of a VA cardiac evaluation is of \r\nrecord and is signed by Dr. L., who certified that he \r\nreviewed the entire claims folder, including the May 1998 \r\nVA cardiology examination report.  Dr. L. noted the veteran's \r\ncontention that his service-connected psychiatric disorder \r\ncaused his heart disease.  It was noted that the veteran's \r\nheart size and rate were normal.  There was no evidence of \r\nmurmurs.  The lungs were not congested and they functioned \r\nnormally.  Dr. L. stated that further diagnostic studies were \r\nunnecessary to establish a diagnosis of disease involving the \r\nheart, noting that no further testing would demonstrate \r\nwhether there was a relationship between post-traumatic \r\nstress disorder and the veteran's heart disease.  In essence, \r\nDr. L. concluded that arteriosclerotic heart disease with \r\ncardiac abnormalities had no relationship to the veteran's \r\nservice time or to his post traumatic stress disorder and \r\nthat the heart disorders were most likely diseases that occur \r\nin the average human being without post traumatic stress \r\ndisorder.  \r\n\r\nIn an informal hearing presentation of March 2000, the \r\nrepresentative argued that Dr. A., the May 1998 examiner, did \r\nnot state that he had reviewed the claims file and did not \r\nrender an opinion as to any relationship between PTSD and the \r\nveteran's heart disorders.  The representative also referred \r\nto the veteran's statement saying that Dr. A. had not \r\nexamined him.  The representative further argued that Dr. L. \r\nhad only reviewed the claims file; thus, the RO did not \r\ncomply with the Board's remand instructions and the case \r\nshould be remanded again for an adequate examination.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCriteria\r\n\r\nPursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a), a person who submits a \r\nclaim for benefits under a law administered by the Secretary \r\nshall have the burden of submitting evidence sufficient to \r\njustify a belief by a fair and impartial individual that the \r\nclaim is well grounded.  \r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \r\n(Court) has held that a well-grounded claim is \"a plausible \r\nclaim, one which is meritorious on its own or capable of \r\nsubstantiation.  Such a claim need not be conclusive but only \r\npossible to satisfy the initial burden of � [5107(a)].\"  \r\nMurphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 78, 81 (1990).  \r\n\r\nThe Court has also held that although a claim need not be \r\nconclusive, the statute provides that it must be accompanied \r\nby evidence that justifies a \"belief by a fair and impartial \r\nindividual\" that the claim is plausible.  Tirpak v. \r\nDerwinski, 2 Vet. App. 609, 610 (1992).  \r\n\r\nThe Court has held that \"where the determinative issue \r\ninvolves medical causation or a medical diagnosis, competent \r\nmedical evidence to the effect that the claim is 'plausible' \r\nor 'possible' is required.\"  Heuer v. Brown, 7 Vet. \r\nApp. 379, 384 (1995); Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 \r\n(1993) (citing Murphy, at 81).  \r\n\r\nThe Court has held that a well-grounded claim requires \r\ncompetent evidence of current disability (a medical \r\ndiagnosis), of incurrence or aggravation of a disease or \r\ninjury in service (lay or medical evidence), and of a nexus \r\nbetween the in-service injury or disease and the current \r\ndisability (medical evidence).  See Epps v. Brown, 126 F.3d. \r\n1464, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. \r\nApp. 498, 506 (1995) aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996). \r\n\r\nIn order to establish service connection for a claimed \r\ndisability the facts must demonstrate that a disease or \r\ninjury resulting in current disability was incurred in active \r\nmilitary service or, if pre-existing active service, was \r\naggravated therein.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131 (West 1991); \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (1999).  \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability which is \r\nproximately due to or the result of service-connected disease \r\nor injury.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310(a).  When there is aggravation \r\nof a nonservice-connected condition which is proximately due \r\nto or the result of service-connected disease or injury, the \r\nclaimant will be compensated for the degree of disability \r\nover and above the degree of disability existing prior to the \r\naggravation.  Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).  \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed \r\nafter discharge, when all the evidence, including that \r\npertinent to service, establishes that the disease was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d) (1999).  \r\n\r\nCardiovascular-renal disease, including hypertension, may be \r\npresumed to have been incurred during active military service \r\nif manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within the \r\nfirst year following active service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, \r\n1112, 1137 (West 1991 & Supp. 1999); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.307, \r\n3.309 (1999).  \r\n\r\nWhere there is a chronic disease shown as such in service or \r\nwithin the presumptive period under � 3.307 so as to permit a \r\nfinding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of \r\nthe same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, \r\nare service connected, unless clearly attributable to \r\nintercurrent causes.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b) (1999).  \r\n\r\nThis rule does not mean that any manifestation in service \r\nwill permit service connection.  To show chronic disease in \r\nservice there is required a combination of manifestations \r\nsufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient \r\nobservation to establish chronicity at the time, as \r\ndistinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis \r\nincluding the word \"chronic.\"  When the disease identity is \r\nestablished, there is no requirement of evidentiary showing \r\nof continuity.  When the fact of chronicity in service is not \r\nadequately supported, then a showing of continuity \r\nafter discharge is required to support the claim.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.303(b) (1999).  \r\n\r\nThe Court has established the following rules with regard to \r\nclaims addressing the issue of chronicity.  The chronicity \r\nprovision of 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b) is applicable where \r\nevidence, regardless of its date, shows that a veteran had a \r\nchronic condition in service and still has such condition.  \r\nSuch evidence must be medical unless it relates to a \r\ncondition as to which, under the Court's case law, lay \r\nobservation is competent.  \r\n\r\nIf the chronicity provision is not applicable, a claim may \r\nstill be well grounded if (1) the condition is observed \r\nduring service, (2) continuity of symptomatology is \r\ndemonstrated thereafter and (3) competent evidence relates \r\nthe present condition to that symptomatology.  Savage v. \r\nGober, 10 Vet. App. 489 (1997).  A lay person is competent to \r\ntestify only as to observable symptoms.  See Savage; Falzone \r\nv. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 403 (1995).  A layperson is not, \r\nhowever, competent to provide evidence that the observable \r\nsymptoms are manifestations of chronic pathology or diagnosed \r\ndisability.  Id.  \r\n\r\nRecently, the Court reaffirmed that for a service-connection \r\nclaim to be well grounded a claimant must submit evidence of \r\neach of the following: (1) medical evidence of a current \r\ndisability; (2) medical evidence, or in certain circumstances \r\nlay evidence, of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a \r\ndisease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus \r\nbetween the asserted in-service injury or disease and the \r\ncurrent disability.  McManaway v. West, 13 Vet. App. 60, 65 \r\n(1999) (citing Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. at 506, aff'd per \r\ncuriam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table)); (also citing \r\nEpps v. Gober, 126 F.3d at 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (expressly \r\nadopting definition of well-grounded claim set forth in \r\nCaluza, supra), cert. denied sub nom.  Epps v. West, 118 S. \r\nCt. 2348 (1998) (mem.)).  \r\n\r\nThe Court also reiterated that, alternatively, either or both \r\nof the second and third Caluza elements can be satisfied, \r\nunder 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b) (1999), by the submission of (a) \r\nevidence that a condition was \"noted\" during service or \r\nduring an applicable presumption period; (b) evidence showing \r\npost-service continuity of symptomatology; and (c) medical \r\nor, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between \r\nthe present disability and the post-service symptomatology.  \r\nMcManaway v. West, 13 Vet. App. at 65 (citing Savage v. \r\nGober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 495-97).  The Court determined that \r\na claim for a right knee condition was not well grounded \r\nbased upon a continuity of symptomatology analysis, when the \r\nsole evidentiary basis for the asserted continuous \r\nsymptomatology was the sworn testimony of the appellant \r\nhimself and when \"no\" medical evidence indicated continuous \r\nsymptomatology.  McManaway, 13 Vet. App. at 66.\r\n\r\nIn Voerth v. West, 13 Vet. App. 117 (1999), the Court held \r\nthat the appellant had not submitted medical evidence \r\nproviding a nexus between an in-service injury and a current \r\ndisability.  The Court held that where a claimant's personal \r\nbelief, no matter how sincere, was unsupported by medical \r\nevidence, the personal belief cannot form the basis of a \r\nwell-grounded claim.  The Court stated that it clearly held \r\nin Savage that section 3.303 does not relieve a claimant of \r\nthe burden of providing a medical nexus.  \r\n\r\nRather, a claimant diagnosed with a chronic condition must \r\nstill provide a medical nexus between the current condition \r\nand the putative continuous symptomatology.  Until the \r\nappellant presents competent medical evidence to provide a \r\nrelationship between a current disability and either an in-\r\nservice injury or continuous symptomatology, the claim cannot \r\nbe considered well grounded.  Voerth, 13 Vet. App. at 120.  \r\n\r\nWhen all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for \r\ndetermining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in \r\nrelative equipoise, with the appellant prevailing in either \r\nevent, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against \r\na claim, in which case, the claim is denied.  Gilbert v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nSection 5107 of Title 38, United States Code unequivocally \r\nplaces an initial burden upon the veteran to produce evidence \r\nthat his claim is well grounded; that is, that his claim is \r\nplausible.  Grivois v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 136, 139 (1994); \r\nGrottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 92 (1993).  Because the \r\nveteran has failed to meet this burden, the Board finds that \r\nhis claim of entitlement to service connection for a heart \r\ndisorder must be denied as not well grounded.  \r\n\r\nThe service medical records do not contain any evidence or \r\ndiagnosis of heart disease or any other cardiovascular \r\ndisorder and the July 1954 service discharge examination \r\nshowed that the veteran's heart and vascular system were \r\nnormal.  A chest x-ray examination was also normal.  \r\n\r\nThere is no post-service medical evidence of cardiac problems \r\nuntil many years after service so there is no basis for \r\ngranting service connection on a presumptive basis.  \r\n38 C.F.R. �� 3.307, 3.309.  \r\n\r\nThe initial post-service medical evidence reflecting \r\ncomplaints of chest pain and palpitations is found in the \r\nprivate medical records beginning in April 1976, many years \r\nafter service.  These records show ongoing evaluation and \r\ntreatment for such symptoms as palpitations, heart rhythm \r\nirregularities, and chest pain through 1992, but they contain \r\nno medical opinion attributing any heart problems to the \r\nveteran's active service or to his service-connected PTSD.  \r\nAlthough a February 1985 treatment record indicates that the \r\nveteran's episodes of syncope, irregular heartbeat and \r\npalpitations most likely occurred during periods of \r\n\"stress,\" the physician did not diagnose an underlying \r\nheart disorder or opine that PTSD caused or aggravated any \r\nheart disorder.  In fact, that physician stated that it was \r\ndifficult to tell whether the veteran's palpitations were \r\npathologic or just due to anxiety.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran does not argue that his heart condition was \r\nincurred during active service or as a result of some \r\nincident or event of active service.  Rather, he argues that \r\nhis heart condition was either caused or permanently \r\naggravated by his service-connected psychiatric disorder.  \r\n\r\nThe medical evidence establishes that the veteran has \r\nmultiple diagnoses including chest wall pain, paroxysmal \r\natrial fibrillation, history of syncope, episodes of syncope, \r\na history of supraventricular tachycardia, possible vasovagal \r\nsyncope, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, a history \r\nof cardiac arrhythmia with palpitation, mitral valve \r\nprolapse, coronary artery disease with inferior myocardial \r\ninfarction, status post coronary artery bypass surgery, dual \r\nchamber pacemaker implantation, atrioventricular node \r\nablation, mitral regurgitation, valvular heart disease, mild \r\naortic insufficiency and ventricular abnormalities and \r\nhypertrophy.  Thus the medical evidence establishes that the \r\nveteran has a current disability, but these diagnoses are \r\nfirst reflected many years after active service and they do \r\nnot tend to establish that any current heart condition had \r\nits onset during or is otherwise attributable to active \r\nservice or attributable to the veteran's service-connected \r\npsychiatric disorder.  \r\n\r\nAs the basic issue in this case is whether the veteran's \r\npost-service heart disease is of service origin or is \r\nproximately due to or aggravated by his service-connected \r\npsychiatric disorder, it is medical in nature and pertains to \r\nthe etiology of the post-service heart disease.  Since the \r\ndeterminative issue involves a medical question, competent \r\nmedical evidence to the effect that the claim is plausible or \r\npossible is required.  Heuer v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. at 384; \r\nGrottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 93.  \r\n\r\nThe only medical evidence of record that addresses this issue \r\nconsists of the September 1999 VA evaluation report.  Dr L., \r\nwho reviewed the entire file, concluded that the veteran's \r\nheart disease has no relationship to service or to PTSD.  \r\nThus, this opinion goes against the claim.  \r\n\r\nThe only evidence indicating a relationship between the \r\nservice-connected post traumatic stress disorder and the \r\nveteran's current heart conditions is statements from the \r\nveteran.  However, they do not well ground this claim because \r\nthe veteran is a lay person and not qualified to render a \r\ncompetent opinion on a medical question.  Grottveit, 5 Vet. \r\nApp. at 93 (Court held that lay assertions of medical \r\ncausation cannot constitute evidence to render a claim well \r\ngrounded).  While a lay person is competent to provide \r\nevidence on the occurrence of observable symptoms during and \r\nfollowing service, a lay person is not competent to make a \r\nmedical diagnosis or render a medical opinion, which relates \r\na medical disorder to a specific cause.  Espiritu v. \r\nDerwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 494-495 (1992) (Court held that a \r\nwitness must be competent in order for his or her statements \r\nor testimony to be probative as to the facts under \r\nconsideration).  \r\n\r\nLacking any competent evidence or opinion linking any current \r\nheart disorder to service or to service-connected PTSD, the \r\nclaim for service connection for a heart disorder is not well \r\ngrounded.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131, 5107(a).  \r\n\r\nPursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) (West 1991), if VA is \r\nplaced on notice of the possible existence of information \r\nthat would render the claim plausible, and therefore well \r\ngrounded, VA has the duty to advise the appellant of the \r\nnecessity to obtain the information.  McKnight v. Gober, 131 \r\nF.3d 1483, 1484-1485 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Robinette v. Brown, 8 \r\nVet. App. 69, 80 (1995).  However, such evidence must be \r\nidentified with some degree of specificity; with an \r\nindication that the evidence exists and that it would well \r\nground the claim.  See Carbino v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 507, \r\n510 (1997).  In this case, the veteran has not identified \r\nexisting medical evidence that would make his claim well \r\ngrounded.  Therefore, 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) is not applicable \r\nto the present case.  \r\n\r\nAs the veteran's claim for service connection for a heart \r\ndisorder is not well grounded, the doctrine of reasonable \r\ndoubt has no application to his case.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran's representative argues that the RO failed to \r\ncomply with the Board's February 1998 remand instructions and \r\nthat the case should be remanded again for an adequate \r\nexamination.  The Court has recently held that if the \r\nappellant fails to submit a well-grounded claim, VA is under \r\nno duty to assist in any further development of the claim.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a); Morton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 477, 480-\r\n481 (1999).  Clearly the veteran's case is not well grounded, \r\nso VA had no duty to offer the veteran an examination or \r\nobtain a medical opinion in the first place.  The 1998 \r\n\"examination\" report, even if based on the extensive record \r\nrather than a contemporaneous examination, offers an opinion \r\nand the opinion goes against the claim.  Thus, absent a well-\r\ngrounded claim, the Board need not remand the case again for \r\nstrict compliance with the prior remand directives.   \r\n\r\nThe Board views its foregoing discussion as sufficient to \r\ninform the veteran of the elements necessary to complete his \r\napplication for service connection.  See Graves v. Brown, 8 \r\nVet. App. 522 (1996); Robinette v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 69, 77-\r\n78 (1995); McKnight v. Gober, 131 F.3d 1483 (Fed. Cir. 1997); \r\nEpps v. Gober, 126 F.3d 1464 (Fed.

Riffe, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from October 1943 to \r\nOctober 1948.  This case comes to the Board of Veterans' \r\nAppeals (Board) from an October 1998 RO decision which denied \r\nhis claim for service connection for PTSD.  He failed to \r\nreport for a Board hearing which was scheduled for January \r\n2001.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the RO also denied an application to \r\nreopen a previously denied claim for service connection for a \r\npsychiatric condition other than PTSD, but such issue has not \r\nbeen appealed.  The present appeal only involves a new claim \r\nfor service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nRO rating decisions in October 1998 and June 1999, and the \r\nAugust 1999 statement of the case, collectively indicate the \r\nRO denied service connection for PTSD on the rationale that \r\nthe claim was not well grounded.  However, there has been a \r\nsignificant change in the law during the pendency of this \r\nappeal.  On November 9, 2000, the President signed into law \r\nthe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-\r\n475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000).  Among other things, this law \r\neliminates the concept of a well-grounded claim and redefines \r\nthe obligations of the VA with respect to notice to a \r\nclaimant and the duty to assist.  This change in law is \r\napplicable to all claims filed on or after the date of \r\nenactment of the law, or filed before the date of enactment \r\nand not yet final as of that date.  Id.  Because of the \r\nchange in the law, a remand is required for compliance with \r\nthe notice and duty to assist provisions contained in the new \r\nlaw.  See Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. \r\n106-475, �� 3-4, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000) (to be codified as \r\namended at 38 U.S.C. �� 5102, 5103, 5103A, and 5107).  \r\n\r\nIn denying the claim, the RO stated that the veteran's \r\nclaimed stressors for PTSD have not been verified, and that \r\nthere is no confirmed diagnosis of PTSD even though he has \r\nbeen noted to have \"PTSD symptoms\" short of a diagnosis.  See \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  Under the circumstances of this case, \r\nas part of the duty to assist, an effort should be made to \r\nverify service stressors, any additional post-service medical \r\nrecords should be obtained, and a VA compensation examination \r\nfor PTSD should be provided.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, this case is REMANDED for the following:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should ascertain whether the \r\nveteran had combat service.  If he did \r\nnot, attempts should be made to verify \r\nclaimed service stressors, including \r\nthrough contact with the U.S. Armed \r\nServices Center for Research of Unit \r\nRecords (USASCRUR).\r\n\r\n2.  The RO should have the veteran \r\nidentify (names, addresses, dates) all VA \r\nand non-VA medical providers who have \r\ntreated him for psychiatric problems since \r\nservice.  The RO should then obtain copies \r\nof the related medical records which are \r\nnot already on file.\r\n\r\n3.  Thereafter, the RO should have the \r\nveteran undergo a VA psychiatric \r\nexamination to diagnose or rule out PTSD.  \r\nThe claims folder should be provided to \r\nand reviewed by the doctor, and the \r\nexamination report should confirm that \r\nsuch has been accomplished.  Any diagnosis \r\nof PTSD should be in accordance with the \r\ncriteria of DSM-IV.  If PTSD is diagnosed, \r\nthe doctor should identify the stressors \r\nwhich are believed to be the cause of the \r\ncondition, and the doctor should explain \r\nwhy such stressors are sufficient under \r\nDSM-IV.\r\n\r\n4.  The RO should ensure that any other \r\nnotification and development action \r\nrequired by the Veterans Claims Assistance \r\nAct of 2000 is completed with respect to \r\nthe veteran's claim for service connection \r\nfor PTSD.\r\n\r\n5.  Thereafter, the RO should review, on \r\nthe merits, the claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD.  If the claim \r\nremains denied, the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative should be provided with a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case, and \r\ngiven an opportunity to respond, before \r\nthe case is returned to the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tL.

Gervasio, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from April 1969 to November \r\n1970.  \r\n\r\nThis case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on \r\nappeal of a March 1996 rating decision of the New Orleans, \r\nLouisiana, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA).  \r\n\r\nThe case was remanded by the Board in January 1998 and April \r\n2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\nPTSD is of service origin.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West \r\n1991); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304 (2000).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nService medical records do not show any complaints or \r\nmanifestations of a psychiatric disorder, including PTSD.  \r\nPrivate medical records, dated from 1960 to 1999, are \r\nnegative for any complaints or treatment for PTSD.  \r\n\r\nA review of the veteran's service records shows that he was \r\nawarded the Vietnam Service Medal and the National Defense \r\nService Medal, but no combat awards.  It was not indicated \r\nthat he had served during any campaign, although it was noted \r\nthat \"11th Campaign Pending.\"  His military occupational \r\nspecialty while he was stationed in Vietnam was as a radio \r\noperator with the 459th Signal Battalion.  He was assigned to \r\nHHC, BMT, 459th Sig Bn from December 2, 1969 to the end of \r\nFebruary 1970 and to Co C, 459th Sig Bn from March November \r\n1970.  There is no indication of any temporary duty \r\nassignment.\r\n\r\nIn February 1995 the veteran submitted a list of stressors.  \r\nHe indicated that he had been assigned to a Special Forces \r\nUnit.  He also indicated that he was a member of the 459th \r\nSig Det on December 12, 1969 when he injured his shoulder \r\nwhile stationed Ban Me Thuot.  He reported weekly exposure to \r\nmotor and/or rocket attacks at his duty station from November \r\n1969 to November 1970 while he was a member of the 459th \r\nSignal Co. \r\n\r\nIn September 1997 the appellant submitted a list of \r\nstressors.  These included daily exposure to motor and/or \r\nrocket attacks.  He stated that he was a member of the 459th \r\nSignal Co.  The attacks occurred on barracks.\r\n\r\nAn examination was conducted by VA in February 1996.  At that \r\ntime, the veteran stated that he was with the Signal Corp and \r\nwas personally attached to a Special Forces Unit in a region \r\ndesignated as \"east field.\"  He stated that upon first \r\narriving by aircraft at Long Bin on November 27, 1969, the \r\nairfield was under a rocket attack.  His unit had just \r\narrived in the country and they had not yet been issued \r\nweapons.  This made him feel even more vulnerable.  \r\n\r\nHe recalled that he was so scared that he lost bladder \r\ncontrol and continued to \"shake\" for the next sixteen \r\nhours.  He reported that his first foray inside the country \r\nwas via a truck convoy to \"Nutran.\"  He recalled this as \r\nbeing a particularly scary event as it took approximately one \r\nand one-half days to go eighty miles, often with stops due to \r\nshelling in the area.  He denied any direct hits to the \r\nconvoy.  He reported that he had pulled his share of guard \r\nduty and listening post duty.  He stated that he feared \r\nfalling asleep and having his throat cut by the enemy.  He \r\nreportedly witnessed two GI's to whom this happened.  \r\n\r\nHe also reported being involved in numerous firefights and \r\ndescribed himself as being so scared that he was too afraid \r\nto look up.  He also reported that, while he was assigned to \r\nthe Special Forces camp, the camp was shelled and a sergeant \r\ntook a more or less direct hit from a mortar or rocket and \r\nwas blown to pieces with only small bits being found.  One \r\nsuch bit was apparently a small piece of flesh that was \r\nclinging to the eyeglasses of another soldier.  After having \r\nsurvived this attack, the veteran felt guilt about having \r\ntemporarily lost his faith in God.  This lead to his \r\ndeveloping a stronger faith in that he felt that God had \r\nsaved him from this attack and he became less fearful.  He \r\ndescribed another incident where the landing gear of a plane \r\nin which he was riding had collapsed on landing, and that \r\nafter this he was afraid to fly.  He also reported that he \r\nwas stationed in a combat area and constantly in fear of \r\nbeing attacked or overrun by the enemy.  But he could not \r\nrecall any other specific incidence which stood out as being \r\nmore frightening or traumatic than those already recounted.  \r\n\r\nOn examination, the veteran reported that his primary \r\nsymptoms were anger, paranoia and feelings of depression.  \r\nWhile he felt that he had been changed by his experiences in \r\nVietnam, he attributed most of his problems to job-related \r\nstresses.  In terms of PTSD symptomatology, he denied \r\nproblems with nightmares, sleep disturbance, or other \r\nflashback type phenomena or disruptive intrusive memories of \r\nVietnam, except for a very brief period after he first \r\nreturned from Vietnam.  He also denied avoidance of stimuli \r\nassociated with Vietnam and stated that he enjoyed watching \r\nVietnam War movies.  \r\n\r\nHe had no difficulty associating with Vietnamese nationals \r\nand denied any particular adverse psychological or \r\nphysiological reaction when exposed to sights, sounds or \r\nother stimuli.  He denied hypervigilance.  He did believe \r\nthat he had been significantly changed by his Vietnam \r\nexperiences in terms of his anger, aggression and decreased \r\ntolerance.  On mental status evaluation, he was alert, well-\r\noriented and showed good insight into his present condition.  \r\nAffect was subdued, but showed a normal range of expression.  \r\nHe was quite appropriate interpersonally and demonstrated \r\ngood social skills.  Thought processes were logical and \r\ncoherent, with no signs of looseness of association or \r\ndelusional content.  He denied auditory or visual \r\nhallucinations, either presently or in the past.  He \r\nevidenced good memory.  Psychological testing was not found \r\nto be consistent with the veteran's clinical presentation.  \r\nBut it was noted that testing for combat exposure was \r\ngenerally consistent with a report of light to moderate \r\nexposure to combat.  \r\n\r\nThe diagnoses were probable major depressive disorder, in \r\nremission (by history); probable previous alcohol abuse, in \r\npartial remission; probable ongoing adjustment disorder with \r\ndysthymic features; probable mild to moderate symptoms of a \r\nPTSD complex, characterized primarily by decreased ability to \r\nhandle or control anger and decreased frustration tolerance, \r\nparticularly when under stress.  \r\n\r\nA second psychiatric evaluation was conducted by VA in \r\nFebruary 1996.  On this evaluation, the veteran's chief \r\ncomplaint was of \"retaliating.\"  He felt that people at \r\nwork and his friends were \"after him.\"  He stated that \r\nthere had recently been some Oriental people hired who caused \r\nhim to have flash backs of Vietnam when seeing them.  He was \r\ndepressed a lot, but this came and went.  Regarding his \r\nmilitary duty, he stated that he was a radio courier \r\nattendant, but that he mostly did guard duty around the \r\nperimeter where he was serving.  He also stated that he went \r\nout to locate the enemy.  He described stressors of a rocket \r\nattack near the Cambodian boarder, when \"everybody was \r\nrunning around,\" finding weapons and firing, without knowing \r\nwho they were firing at.  The next morning he stated that he \r\nremembered the smell of charred human flesh that he \r\nremembered vividly to this day.  He began crying at this \r\npoint.  When asked about other stressors, he stated that \r\nthere was just stress \"of everyday.\"  He said that he began \r\nusing drugs at this time to cope with the stress.  He stated \r\nthat he stopped using drugs around 1970.  \r\n\r\nOn mental status evaluation, it was noted that the veteran \r\nwas dressed in a military fashion, with back boots, and wore \r\na Vietnam veteran's cap.  He cried rather profusely when \r\ntalking about cursing God when he was in Vietnam.  His mood \r\nwas mildly depressed.  He denied suicidal ideation, but \r\nadmitted to homicidal ideation.  He admitted to being \r\nparanoid and he was asked about auditory or visual \r\nhallucinations and said that most of them were associated \r\nwith Vietnam.  He occasionally saw things like something \r\ncoming out of the bushes.  \r\n\r\nLoud noises, the sound of helicopters, smelling Vietnamese \r\nfood triggered flashbacks.  His recent and remote memory was \r\ngood.  His insight was limited.  Judgment was considered poor \r\nat times, particularly when under stress.  He showed no \r\nevidence of a psychotic process.  The diagnoses were PTSD; \r\nalcohol abuse; polysubstance dependence, in remission; \r\nnicotine dependence, in remission; and major depression, \r\nrecurrent, in partial remission.  \r\n\r\nIn response to an inquiry to provide specific details of \r\nclaimed stressful events that occurred during his tour of \r\nduty in Vietnam, the veteran, in May 1998, related several \r\nincidents.  The first, he stated, occurred on November 27, \r\n1969, his birthday.  On that day, he had just arrived at Long \r\nBinh, in Vietnam, and was subjected to a \"B-40 Rocket \r\nattack.\"  Another such attack occurred shortly thereafter, \r\nwhile he was on convoy duty to \"Ban Me Tui\"  He reports \r\nthat he was then assigned to a \"M.A.C.V. compound\" which \r\nwas burned to the ground by rocket attacks.  He stated that \r\nhe was often pulled to go on special assignment with a squad \r\nof South Vietnam Soldiers to set up a Listening Post to try \r\nand locate the enemy.  He performed this duty for months at a \r\ntime.  \r\n\r\nIn August 1998, the RO submitted a request to the United \r\nStates Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records \r\n(USASCRUR) to verify the stressors.  It was requested that \r\nUSASCRUR review the veteran's service records and statements \r\nand provide any verification for the veteran's claimed \r\nstressors.  In July 1999, USASCRUR responded that they had \r\nreviewed documents pertaining to the veteran's unit, the \r\n459th Signal Battalion, between November 1, 1969, and January \r\n31, 1970, which they enclosed.  These records did show enemy \r\nattacks during this time, but that no unit casualties \r\noccurred as a result of these attacks.  No rocket attack \r\ncould be documented at Long Binh in late November or early \r\nDecember 1969.  \r\n\r\nRegarding the specific combat incidents, including base camp \r\nattacks and casualties that the veteran has reported, \r\nadditional information is needed to confirm those incidents.  \r\nIf was further noted that the veteran's service documents did \r\nnot show that he was assigned to any unit other than the \r\nHeadquarters Company and Company C of the 459th Signal \r\nBattalion during his Vietnam tour.  USASCRUR was not able to \r\ndocument that the veteran was assigned or attached to any \r\nSpecial Forces unit during this time.  \r\n\r\nUSASCRUR furnished copies of the Operational report and \r\nLessons Learned from November 1, 1969 to January 31, 1970.  \r\nDuring this time there were three enemy attacks.  Two attacks \r\noccurred at Nha Trang.  The first was a mortar attack on the \r\nBOQ was on January 17, 1970, which resulted in no \r\ncausalities.  The second attack occurred on February 1, 1970 \r\non the BOQ area and Nha Trang Sig Bn area resulting in no \r\ncasualties.  The third was a rocket attack on the Ban Me \r\nThuot bungalow on January 29, 1970.  It was also reported \r\nthat the Ban Me Thuot Battalion Signal Site was destroyed by \r\nfire on December 19, 1969.\r\n\r\nIn correspondence received from the veteran in July 2000, he \r\nrelated that he was, while assigned to the 459th Signal \r\nBattalion, involved in the rocket attack on the Ban Me Thuot \r\nbungalow in January 1970.  \r\n\r\nIn order to establish service connection for a claimed \r\ndisability, the facts, as shown by the evidence, must \r\ndemonstrate that a particular disease or injury resulting in \r\ncurrent disability was incurred during active service or, if \r\npreexisting active service, was aggravated therein.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131.  If a condition noted during \r\nservice is not shown to be chronic, then generally, a showing \r\nof continuity of symptoms after service is required for \r\nservice connection.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b).  \r\n\r\nService connection for post-traumatic stress disorder \r\nrequires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in \r\naccordance with Sec. 4.125(a) of this chapter; a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence, between current symptoms and \r\nan in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that \r\nthe claimed in-service stressor occurred.  If the evidence \r\nestablishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy \r\nand the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the \r\nabsence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and \r\nprovided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the \r\ncircumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's \r\nservice, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the \r\noccurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  \r\n\r\nIf the evidence establishes that the veteran was a prisoner-\r\nof-war under the provisions of Sec. 3.1(y) of this part and \r\nthe claimed stressor is related to that prisoner-of-war \r\nexperience, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence \r\nto the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is \r\nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone \r\nmay establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service \r\nstressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (f).\r\n\r\nThe evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a \r\nrecognizable stressor during service to support a claim of \r\nentitlement to service connection for PTSD will vary \r\ndepending on whether or not the veteran was engaged in combat \r\nwith the enemy. Where it is determined, through recognized \r\nmilitary citations or other supportive evidence, that the \r\nveteran was engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed \r\nstressors are related to such combat, the veteran's lay \r\ntestimony regarding claimed stressors must be accepted as \r\nconclusive as to their actual occurrence and no further \r\ndevelopment for corroborative evidence will be required, \r\nprovided that the veteran's testimony is found to be \r\n\"satisfactory,\" e.g., credible, and \"consistent with the \r\ncircumstances, conditions, or hardships of such service.\"  \r\n\r\nWhere, however, the VA determines that the veteran did not \r\nengage in combat with the enemy, or that the veteran did \r\nengage in combat with the enemy but the claimed stressor is \r\nnot related to such combat, the veteran's lay testimony, by \r\nitself, will not be enough to establish the occurrence of the \r\nalleged stressor.  Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91 (1993).  \r\n\r\nTo summarize, the Board is aware that there are \r\ninconsistencies in the stressors reported by the veteran and \r\nthose verified by USASCRUR.  The Board is also aware that the \r\nevents in issue occurred more than 30 years ago.  The Board \r\nis satisfied that the veteran did come under enemy rocket \r\nattacks while a member of the 459th Signal Battalion.  \r\n\r\nThe February 1996 VA psychiatric examination revealed a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD.  The report demonstrates that the \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD was based in part on the rocket attacks.  \r\nThis stressor has been verified.  Under these circumstances, \r\nit is found that the veteran's PTSD had its onset as a result \r\nof service.  \r\n\r\nOn November 9, 2000, the President signed into law the \r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-475, \r\n114 Stat. 2096 (2000).  Among other things, this law \r\neliminates the concept of a well-grounded claim, redefines \r\nthe obligations of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \r\nwith respect to the duty to assist, and supercedes the \r\ndecision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans \r\nClaims in Morton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 477 (1999), withdrawn \r\nsub nom. Morton v. Gober, No. 96-1517 (U.S. Vet. App. Nov. 6, \r\n2000) (per curiam order), which had held that VA cannot \r\nassist in the development of a claim that is not well \r\ngrounded.  The RO has not reviewed this claim in conjunction \r\nwith the new legislation.  However, this decision represents \r\na complete grant of the benefit sought.  The Board is \r\nsatisfied that the veteran has not been prejudiced by this \r\ndecision.  Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet.

Cieplak, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from August 1963 to \r\nDecember 1968.\r\n\r\nThis appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a May 1999 rating decision by the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nChicago, Illinois, which denied the benefit sought.  In \r\nDecember 2000, the veteran withdrew his request for a hearing \r\nbefore a travel section of the Board.\r\n\r\nAdditional medical consultation and treatment records were \r\nreceived in November 2000 after the case had been certified \r\nto the Board by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ); \r\nsuch evidence has not first been considered by the AOJ.  \r\nPursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 20.1304 (2000), pertinent evidence \r\nreceived by the Board under this section necessitates a \r\nreturn of the case to the AOJ for review, consideration and \r\npreparation of a supplemental statement of the case prior to \r\na Board decision unless there has been a waiver of such \r\nreferral.  The evidence submitted in this case does not \r\nsupply a PTSD stressor capable of verification.  Since the \r\nissue before the Board is concerned with such a stressor, \r\nsuch evidence is, thus, not pertinent and does not preclude a \r\ndecision by the Board at this time. \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  All relevant evidence necessary for an equitable \r\ndisposition of this appeal has been obtained by the RO.\r\n\r\n2.  The record does not demonstrate that the veteran engaged \r\nin combat with the enemy.\r\n\r\n3.  The medical evidence does not show a link between a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD and a verified stressor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by active military \r\nservice.  Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. \r\n106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000); 38 U.S.C.A. �  1110 (West \r\n1991 & Supp. 2000); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303 (2000). \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThis appeal arises out of the veteran's claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD.  In particular, the veteran maintains \r\nthat he was exposed to stressful incidents during service in \r\nVietnam, and that these incidents led to his development of \r\nPTSD.  \r\n\r\nAs a preliminary matter, the Board notes that effective \r\nNovember 9, 2000, the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, \r\nwas signed into law.  See Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 \r\n(2000) (\"VCAA\").  This law sets forth requirements for \r\nassisting a claimant in developing the facts pertinent to his \r\nor her claim.  The Board finds that even though this law was \r\nenacted during the pendency of this appeal, and thus, has not \r\nbeen considered by the RO, there is no prejudice to the \r\nveteran in proceeding with this appeal.  See Bernard v. \r\nBrown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 394 (1993) (when the Board addresses \r\na matter not addressed by the RO, the Board must provide an \r\nadequate statement of reasons and bases as to why there is no \r\nprejudice to the veteran).  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the veteran was provided adequate notice \r\nas to the evidence needed to substantiate his claim.  The RO \r\nhas made satisfactory efforts to ensure that all relevant \r\nevidence including post service medical records has been \r\nassociated with the claims file, and numerous attempts have \r\nbeen made to verify his claimed stressors.  The veteran has \r\nbeen offered an opportunity to submit additional evidence in \r\nsupport of his claim.  In short, the Board concludes that the \r\nduty to assist has been satisfied, as well as the duty to \r\nnotify the veteran of the evidence needed to substantiate his \r\nclaim, and the Board will proceed with appellate disposition \r\non the merits.  \r\n\r\nAccording to the law, service connection will be granted if \r\nit is shown that a veteran has a disability resulting from an \r\ninjury or disease contracted in the line of duty, or for \r\naggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease in \r\nactive military service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 1991 & \r\nSupp. 2000); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  \"Generally, to prove \r\nservice connection, a claimant must submit (1) medical \r\nevidence of a current disability, (2) medical evidence, or in \r\ncertain circumstances lay testimony, of in-service incurrence \r\nor aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) medical \r\nevidence of a nexus between the current disability and the \r\nin-service disease or injury.\"  Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. \r\n341, 346 (1999).  Where the determinative issue involves a \r\nmedical diagnosis, competent medical evidence is required.  \r\nThis burden typically cannot be met by lay testimony because \r\nlay persons are not competent to offer medical opinions.  See \r\nEspiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 494-95 (1992). \r\n\r\nThe mere fact of an in-service injury is not enough; there \r\nmust be chronic disability resulting from that injury.  If \r\nthere is no evidence of a chronic condition during service, \r\nor an applicable presumption period, then a showing of \r\ncontinuity of symptomatology after service is required to \r\nsupport the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b).  Evidence of a \r\nchronic condition must be medical, unless it relates to a \r\ncondition to which lay observation is competent.  See Savage \r\nv. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 495-498 (1997).  If service \r\nconnection is established by continuity of symptomatology, \r\nthere must be medical evidence that relates a current \r\ncondition to that symptomatology.  Id.  Service connection \r\nmay also be granted for any disease diagnosed after \r\ndischarge, when all the evidence establishes that the disease \r\nwas incurred in service.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nPrior to March 7, 1997, governing regulations provided that \r\nservice connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\nestablishing a clear diagnosis of the condition, credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor \r\nactually occurred, and a link, established by medical \r\nevidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed in-\r\nservice stressor.  If the claimed stressor is related to \r\ncombat, service department evidence that the veteran engaged \r\nin combat or that the veteran was awarded the Purple Heart, \r\nCombat Infantryman Badge, or similar combat citation will be \r\naccepted, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as \r\nconclusive evidence of the claimed in-service stressor.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nHowever, on June 18, 1999 and retroactive to March 7, 1997, \r\nthat regulation was amended to read as follows: Service \r\nconnection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the \r\ncondition in accordance with Sec. 4.125(a) of this chapter, a \r\nlink, established by medical evidence, between current \r\nsymptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting \r\nevidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually \r\noccurred.  If the evidence establishes that the veteran \r\nengaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is \r\nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions, and hardships \r\nof the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone \r\nmay establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service \r\nstressor.  If the evidence establishes that the veteran was a \r\nprisoner-of-war under the provisions of Sec. 3.1(y) of this \r\npart and the claimed stressor is related to that prisoner-of-\r\nwar experience, in the absence of clear and convincing \r\nevidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed \r\nstressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions and \r\nhardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay \r\ntestimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed \r\nin-service stressor. 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West 1991); 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.304(f) (effective March 7, 1997).\r\n\r\nPursuant to Karnas v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 308 (1991), \r\nwhere a law or regulation changes after the claim has been \r\nfiled or reopened before administrative or judicial review \r\nhas been concluded, the version most favorable to the veteran \r\napplies unless Congress provided otherwise or permitted the \r\nVA Secretary to do otherwise and the Secretary did so.\r\n\r\nAs to the stressor element under �3.304(f), the evidence \r\nnecessary to establish the occurrence of a recognizable \r\nstressor during service varies depending on whether or not \r\nthe veteran was \"engaged in combat with the enemy.\"  West v. \r\nBrown, 7 Vet. App. 70, 76 (1994).  The Board is required to \r\n\"make specific findings of fact as to whether or not the \r\nveteran was engaged in combat with the enemy and, if so, \r\nwhether the claimed stressor is related to such combat.\"  See \r\nZarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 (1996).  If the claimed \r\nstressor is not combat related, \"the veteran's lay testimony \r\nregarding [an] in-service stressors is insufficient, standing \r\nalone, to establish service connection and must be \r\ncorroborated by \"credible evidence,\" Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. \r\nApp. 283, 289 (1994).\r\n\r\n\"[E]ngaged in combat with the enemy\" requires that the \r\nveteran have personally taken part in a fight or encounter \r\nwith a military foe or hostile unit of instrumentality.  The \r\nphrase would not apply to veterans who served in a general \r\n\"combat area\" or \"combat zone\" but did not themselves \r\nengage in combat with the enemy.  The issue must be resolved \r\non a case-by-case basis, assessing the credibility, probative \r\nvalue, and relative weight of each relevant item of evidence.  \r\nVAOPGCPREC 12-99 (Oct. 18, 1999).\r\n\r\nThe veteran provided a detailed accounting of his claimed \r\nstressors while in Vietnam.  He was in Vietnam for \r\napproximately 2 1/2  months in 1968, from May 27, 1968 to \r\nAugust 11, 1968.  His military occupational specialty was as \r\na radar operator.  According to a March 1998 statement, the \r\nveteran had been stationed at a firebase approximately 20 \r\nmiles North of Ahn Khe, Vietnam.  During guard duty, he \r\nclaims he would view the surrounding country with a telescope \r\nor field glasses.  He claimed that at one time he witnessed a \r\nfriend named L.P. driving a vehicle, being blown up by a mine \r\nand killed while enroute to his station.  He also claimed \r\nbeing subjected to daily rocket attacks.  On the same \r\nquestionnaire, he denied any association with graves \r\nregistration or in transporting bodies.  The United States \r\nCenter for Research of Unit Records was unable to verify that \r\nanyone identified by the veteran as L.P. was injured or \r\nkilled while the veteran was in Vietnam or that his claimed \r\nstressors could otherwise be verified.  Documented enemy \r\nattacks against his unit are after the veteran's departure \r\nfrom Vietnam.  Subsequently, the veteran provided evidence \r\nthat an individual named C.K.R. was killed at An Khe, Vietnam \r\nwhen his vehicle struck a mine.  At his VA mental disorders \r\nexamination, the veteran also claimed that on his return \r\nflight home he was the only live passenger placed on a plane \r\nfilled only with \"hundreds of dead bodies.\"   \r\n\r\nEvidence to support a claim that a veteran engaged in combat \r\nmay include the veteran's own statements and an \"almost \r\nunlimited\" variety of other types of evidence.  However, VA \r\nis not required to accept the veteran's assertion that he \r\nengaged in combat.  Gaines v. West, 11 Vet. App. 353 (1998).  \r\nNeither is VA required to accept statements or testimony \r\nwhich is inherently incredible.  See Samuels v. West, 11 Vet. \r\nApp. 433 (1998).  VA would ordinarily be justified in \r\nconcluding that certain military citations constitute \r\nsufficient evidence, in the absence of evidence to the \r\ncontrary, that a particular veteran engaged in combat.  \r\nHowever, the records do not document receipt of such \r\ndecorations and awards indicative of combat, and, \r\naccordingly, that weighs against the claim in this instance.  \r\nMoreover, the veteran is reported to have served as a radar \r\noperator affiliated with a mortar unit rather than as an \r\ninfantryman, which, suggests that, while he was in a combat \r\narea, he did not personally engage in combat with the enemy.  \r\nMoreover, he does not assert combat status  Accordingly, the \r\nBoard considers that the preponderance of the evidence is \r\nagainst the veteran having served in combat.\r\n\r\nA stressor involves exposure to a traumatic event in which \r\nthe person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an \r\nevent or events that involved actual or threatened death or \r\nserious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self \r\nor others and the person's response involved intense fear, \r\nhelplessness, or horror.  See Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. \r\n128 (1997).  \r\n\r\nThe sufficiency of a stressor is a medical determination and \r\nis presumed by a medical diagnosis of PTSD.  Cohen.  \r\nNevertheless, the occurrence of a stressor is an adjudicatory \r\ndetermination.  If the claimed stressor is related to combat, \r\nservice department evidence that the veteran engaged in \r\ncombat or that the veteran was awarded the Purple Heart \r\nMedal, Combat Infantryman Badge, or similar combat citation \r\nwill be accepted, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, \r\nas conclusive evidence of the claimed in-service stressor.  \r\n\"Credible supporting evidence\" is necessary such stressors \r\nand be obtained from service records or other sources.  \r\nMoreau, supra.  However, the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims (known as the United States Court of \r\nVeterans Appeals prior to March 1, 1999) (hereinafter, \r\n\"Court\") has held that the regulatory requirement for \r\n\"credible supporting evidence\" means that \"the appellant's \r\ntestimony, by itself, cannot, as a matter of law, establish \r\nthe occurrence of a noncombat stressor.\"  Dizoglio v. Brown, \r\n9 Vet. App. 163 (1996).\r\n\r\nThe RO sought to obtain verifiable evidence of the alleged \r\nincidents.  Based on the lay statements of record and the \r\nresponses from official agencies, it is concluded that no \r\nincident reports capable of verification of the claimed \r\nstressors were filed.  Lay testimony is not competent to \r\nprove a matter requiring medical expertise, such as a \r\ndiagnosis or an opinion as to medical causation.  See \r\nEspiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 494-495 (1992). \r\n\r\nThe credibility of a witness can be impeached by a showing of \r\ninterest, bias, or inconsistent statements.  The veteran's \r\nstake in the outcome of this claim affects the credibility of \r\nhis assertions or opinion.  See Cartwright v. Derwinski, 2 \r\nVet. App. 24, 25 (1991) (holding that while interest in the \r\noutcome of a proceeding does not affect the competency of to \r\ntestify, it may affect the credibility of testimony). \r\n\r\nThe Board considers the account that he was the sole live \r\npassenger placed on a plane with hundreds of dead bodies \r\ninherently incredible.  Had the claimed event in that regard \r\nreally happened, the Board is of the opinion that the veteran \r\nwould have advanced the claim when he filled out the PTSD \r\nstressor development questionnaire.  The Board also observes \r\nthat while the veteran claimed exposure on a daily basis to \r\nrocket attacks, the record does not corroborate the claim.  \r\nClose evaluation of the claimed stressor associated with the \r\nperson who was killed when a mine exploded also does not \r\nfavor the veteran.  That individual was killed at a location \r\nsome 20 miles away from where the veteran was stationed.  \r\nHowever, even assuming the veteran was using a telescope or \r\nfield glasses at the time, the incident occurred far from \r\nwhere the veteran was at the time for him to be aware at the \r\ntime of death or serious injury to anyone.  Nevertheless, the \r\nincident, at least based on the record, probably occurred \r\nabout 20 miles from the veteran, too far for him to have seen \r\nit.  Accordingly, the claimed stressors are not verified in \r\nthis instance. \r\n\r\nIn this case, the source evidence of the stressors derives \r\nfrom the veteran alone and has not been verified.  \r\nAccordingly, it is concluded that, even if the veteran \r\ncarried diagnoses that unequivocally include PTSD, such \r\ndiagnosis would be based on a stressor, which has been \r\ndefined by the Court as inadequate as a matter of law to \r\nconstitute \"credible supporting evidence.\"  Hence, it would \r\nnot be profitable to obtain additional medical evidence, in \r\nview of the absence of a confirmed stressor. \r\n\r\nService medical records are silent as to complaints, \r\ntreatment or diagnoses relating to PTSD.  In November 1967, a \r\npsychiatric evaluation was afforded due to history of rule \r\ninfractions and depression.  The mental evaluation noted \r\nmarital problems only.  No severe psychiatric pathology was \r\nfound.  An impression of passive aggressive disorder was \r\ngiven.  On discharge, no mental disorders were identified and \r\nthe veteran was reported as clinically normal.\r\n\r\nThere is no medical opinion suggesting that any currently \r\ndiagnosed disorder is related to or due to some other \r\nincident of the veteran's active military service apart from \r\nthe unverified stressors.  The preponderance of the evidence \r\nis against the veteran's claim.  As such. there is not an \r\napproximate balance of positive and negative evidence \r\nregarding the merits of the veteran's claim that would give \r\nrise to a reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran, the \r\nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applicable, and the appeal \r\nis denied.

App. 49, 54-56 \r\n(1990). \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tBRUCE KANNEE\r\n\tMember, Board of Veterans' Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"5bec3ad78102470b4a111765","name":"0116083.txt","plainText":"Citation Nr: 0116083\t\r\nDecision Date: 06/13/01    Archive Date: 06/19/01\t\r\n\r\nDOCKET NO.  94-07 039\t)\tDATE\r\n\t)\r\n\t)\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric \r\ndisorder, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nStephen F. Sylvester, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from July 1972 to June 1975. \r\n\r\nCurrently before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) is a \r\nrebuilt claims folder, the veteran's original claims folder \r\nhaving been lost at the RO.  Available evidence of record is \r\nto the effect that, while certain of the veteran's personnel \r\nrecords have, in fact, been obtained, attempts to procure his \r\nservice medical records have been unsuccessful.  In a \r\nSupplemental Statement of the Case dated in June 1996, it was \r\nnoted that, in December 1993, there was issued a Statement of \r\nthe Case, followed by a Supplemental Statement of the Case in \r\nJuly 1994.  Neither of these Statements of the Case is \r\ncurrently a part of the veteran's claims folder.  Presumably, \r\nthe aforementioned Statement of the Case was preceded by a \r\nrating action denying the benefit sought, and a Notice of \r\nDisagreement, neither of which is at present a part of the \r\nveteran's file.  \r\n\r\nThe Board observes that, at the time of the issuance of the \r\naforementioned Supplemental Statement of the Case in June \r\n1996, it was noted that letters sent to the veteran in \r\nOctober and December 1995 requesting information regarding \r\nhis inservice stressors had gone unanswered.  Additionally \r\nnoted was that the veteran had failed to report for a \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) examination scheduled in \r\nNovember 1995.  \r\n\r\nBased on the available evidence of record, it is clear that \r\nstressor verification letters sent to the veteran in December \r\n1999 and March 2001 were inadequate.  This is particularly \r\nthe case given that the veteran's alleged inservice stressors \r\nconsisted of two sexual assaults/rapes by fellow service \r\nmembers.  Because of the unique problems encountered in \r\ndocumenting personal-assault claims, the Regional Office (RO) \r\nis responsible for assisting the veteran in gathering, from \r\nsources in addition to inservice records, evidence \r\ncorroborating an inservice stressor, by sending a special \r\nletter and questionnaire, by carefully evaluating that \r\nevidence, including behavior changes, and by furnishing a \r\nclinical evaluation of behavior evidence.  See VA \r\nAdjudication Procedure Manual M 21-1 (Manual M 21-1), Part \r\nIII, paragraph 5.14c (February 20, 1996); see also Patton v. \r\nWest, 12 Vet. App. 272 (1999).  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that, in addition to a diagnosis of \r\npost-traumatic stress disorder, the veteran has received \r\nother psychiatric diagnoses of an avoidant personality \r\ndisorder, and an adjustment disorder with accompanying \r\ndepression.  All of these diagnoses are contained in VA \r\nclinical records currently in the claims folder.  The VA \r\nmedical records indicate that the diagnosis of PTSD has been \r\nlinked to the reported sexual assaults in service.  Under \r\nsuch circumstances, and in light of the aforementioned, \r\nfurther development of the evidence is necessary prior to a \r\nfinal adjudication of the veteran's current claim.  This \r\ndevelopment, however, will not include additional attempts to \r\nobtain the veteran's missing service medical records, \r\ninasmuch as this is a rebuilt claims folder, and exhaustive \r\nmeasures have already been undertaken in an attempt to secure \r\nthose missing documents.  \r\n\r\nFinally, the Board observes that, during the pendency of the \r\nveteran's appeal, there has been a significant change in the \r\nlaw.  More specifically, on November 9, 2000, the President \r\nsigned into law the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 \r\n(VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000).  This law \r\nredefines the obligations of the VA with respect to the duty \r\nto assist, and includes an enhanced duty to notify a claimant \r\nas to the information and evidence necessary to substantiate \r\na claim for VA benefits.  This law also eliminates the \r\nconcept of a well-grounded claim, and supersedes the decision \r\nof the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \r\n(Court) in Morton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 477 (1999), withdrawn \r\nsub nom.  Morton v. Gober, No. 96-1517 (U.S. Vet. App. Nov. \r\n6, 2000) (per curiam order), which had held that the VA \r\ncannot assist in the development of a claim that is not well \r\ngrounded.  This change in the law is applicable to all claims \r\nfiled on or after the date of enactment of the VCAA, or filed \r\nbefore the date of enactment, and not yet final as of that \r\ndate.  Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub. L. \r\nNo. 106-475, � 7(a), 114 Stat. 2096 (2000).  See also \r\nKarnas v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 308 (1991).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  Any pertinent VA or other inpatient \r\nor outpatient treatment records \r\nsubsequent to September 1999 should be \r\nobtained and incorporated in the claims \r\nfolder.  The veteran should be requested \r\nto sign the necessary authorization for \r\nrelease of any private medical records to \r\nthe VA.  \r\n\r\n2.  The RO should then request from the \r\nveteran pertinent information regarding \r\nthe alleged inservice sexual \r\nassaults/rapes reportedly responsible for \r\nhis currently diagnosed post-traumatic \r\nstress disorder.  In so doing, the RO \r\nshould specifically adhere to the \r\nprovisions of Part III, paragraph 5.14c \r\nof the VA Adjudication Procedure Manual M \r\n21-1 (Manual M 21-1) (February 20, 1996), \r\ndictating the procedures to be followed \r\nin the documentation of personal and/or \r\nsexual assault claims.  Regarding his \r\ninservice assaults, the veteran should be \r\nrequested to identify any sources \r\n(military or non-military) which might \r\nprovide information concerning the \r\nincidents in question, for example, \r\nwhether he sought help from a rape crisis \r\ncenter, counseling facility, or health \r\nclinic.  Inquiry should additionally be \r\nmade as to whether the veteran confided \r\nin a roommate, family member, chaplain, \r\nclergy, or fellow service person, and, if \r\nso, whether he might possibly obtain \r\nstatements from those individuals \r\nconcerning their knowledge of the \r\nincidents.  See Patton v. West, 12 \r\nVet. App. 272 (1999).  All such \r\ninformation, when obtained, should be \r\nmade a part of the veteran's claims \r\nfolder.\r\n\r\n3.  The veteran should then be afforded a \r\nVA psychiatric examination in order to \r\ndetermine the nature and etiology of his \r\ncurrent psychiatric disorder, to include \r\na post-traumatic stress disorder.  All \r\npertinent symptomatology and findings \r\nshould be reported in detail.  The RO \r\nshould specify for the examiner the \r\nstressor or stressors which it has \r\ndetermined are established by the record, \r\nand the examiner is to be instructed that \r\nonly those events may be considered for \r\nthe purpose of determining whether \r\nexposure to a stressor in service has \r\nresulted in PTSD.  Following completion \r\nof the examination, the examiner should \r\nanswer the following questions:  (a) Does \r\nthe veteran currently suffer from a \r\nchronic acquired psychiatric disorder (to \r\ninclude a post-traumatic stress \r\ndisorder), as distinguished from a \r\npersonality disorder, and, if so, what is \r\nthe diagnosis of that acquired \r\npsychiatric disorder?  (b) If the answer \r\nto question (a) is in the affirmative, is \r\nit at least as likely as not that the \r\nacquired psychiatric disorder in question \r\ndeveloped during the veteran's period of \r\nactive service, or is it otherwise \r\nrelated to the veteran's active service?  \r\n(c) Should it be determined that the \r\nveteran currently suffers from a \r\npsychosis, is it at least as likely as \r\nnot that such psychosis was manifest \r\nwithin the first year following the \r\nveteran's discharge from active military \r\nservice?  The claims file and a separate \r\ncopy of this REMAND must be made \r\navailable to and reviewed by the examiner \r\nprior to conduction and completion of the \r\npsychiatric examination. \r\n\r\n4.  Thereafter, the RO should review the \r\nclaims file, and ensure that all \r\nnotification and development action \r\nrequired by the Veterans Claims \r\nAssistance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-\r\n475, is completed.  \r\n\r\n5.  The RO should then readjudicate the \r\nveteran's claim.  If the benefit sought \r\non appeal remains denied, the veteran \r\nshould be provided a Supplemental \r\nStatement of the Case (SSOC).  The SSOC \r\nmust contain notice of all relevant \r\nactions taken on the claim for benefits, \r\nto include a summary of the evidence and \r\napplicable law and regulations considered \r\npertinent to the issue currently on \r\nappeal.  An appropriate period of time \r\nshould be allowed for response.  \r\n\r\nThereafter, the case should be returned to the Board, if in \r\norder.  The appellant need take no action until otherwise \r\nnotified.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded to \r\nthe regional office.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 \r\n(1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment by the RO.  \r\nThe law requires that all claims that are remanded by the \r\nBoard of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or \r\nother appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious \r\nmanner.

Giannecchini,  Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active military service from November 1967 to \r\nDecember 1970.  This matter came to the Board of Veterans' \r\nAppeals (Board) on appeal of a February 1999 rating decision \r\nof the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office \r\n(RO) in Detroit, Michigan.  In March 2001, the veteran \r\ntestified before the undersigned Member of the Board at a \r\nhearing at the RO.  A transcript of the hearing has been \r\nassociated with the claims folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nInitially, the Board notes that during the pendency of the \r\nveteran's appeal, the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 \r\n(VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000), was \r\nsigned into law.  This liberalizing law is applicable to the \r\nveteran's claim.  See Karnas v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 308, \r\n312-13 (1991).  It essentially eliminates the requirement \r\nthat a claimant submit evidence of a well-grounded claim, and \r\nprovides that VA will assist a claimant in obtaining evidence \r\nnecessary to substantiate a claim but is not required to \r\nprovide assistance to a claimant if there is no reasonable \r\npossibility that such assistance would aid in substantiating \r\nthe claim.  It also includes new notification provisions.  \r\nSpecifically, it requires VA to notify the claimant and the \r\nclaimant's representative, if any, of any information, and \r\nany medical or lay evidence, not previously provided to the \r\nSecretary that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  As \r\npart of the notice, VA is to specifically inform the claimant \r\nand the claimant's representative, if any, of which portion, \r\nif any, of the evidence is to be provided by the claimant and \r\nwhich part, if any, VA will attempt to obtain on behalf of \r\nthe claimant.  \r\n\r\nIn reviewing the veteran's claims file, with respect to his \r\nreported stressors, the Board notes that the veteran has \r\nreported that sometime between July and September 1969, while \r\nwith HQ Co., 4th Marines, 3rd Marine Division, he witnessed a \r\nfellow serviceman, Richard Blane, become engulfed by flames, \r\nafter some fuel Blane was attempting to move was ignited by \r\nfire from a malfunctioning generator.  Blane was reportedly \r\nextinguished by other servicemen, and subsequently taken away \r\nfor medical treatment.  In addition, the veteran has reported \r\nthat while at Fire Base Vandergrift, an enemy rocket struck \r\nthe base mess hall, severely injuring a mess hall sergeant.  \r\nThe veteran reportedly helped bandage the sergeant and carry \r\nhim to a truck, where he was taken away for treatment.  \r\nFurthermore, the veteran has reported that he experienced \r\nrocket and mortar attacks while at Fire Base Vandergrift.  \r\n\r\nThe RO has contacted both the U.S. Marine Corps Personnel \r\nManagement Support Branch (PMSB), as well as the Marine Corps \r\nHistorical Center, in an attempt to verify the veteran's \r\nclaimed stressor incidents.  The Marine Corps PMSB notified \r\nthe RO that a search of unit diaries of Headquarters Company \r\nfor April, July, August, and September 1969, did not show a \r\nRichard Blane as a causality.  However, there was a record \r\nR.W. Dobson sustaining facial and body burns.  The RO \r\nsubsequently received from the Marine Corps Historical Center \r\ncommand chronologies for HQ Co., 4th Marines, dated from July \r\nthrough September 1969.  They show that various HQ Co. units \r\nengaged in combat with the enemy and sustained casualties, \r\nand that base facilities received enemy rocket and mortar \r\nfire.  The veteran had also, on his own, requested \r\ninformation from the Marine Corps Historical Center, and \r\nreceived command chronologies for HQ Co. 4th Marines, dated \r\nfrom January through July 1969.  These, he reported, had not \r\ncontained evidence sufficient to verify his reported \r\nstressors.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran has requested that VA obtain morning reports for \r\nHQ Co., 4th Marines, 3rd Marine Division, for the months of \r\nApril and August 1969.  These, he believes, will help in \r\nverifying his reported stressor incidents, particularly with \r\nregard to verifying the accident involving Richard Blane.  \r\nThe RO has not attempted to procure morning reports from the \r\nNational Personnel Records Center (NPRC).  \r\n\r\nUnder the VCAA, the Secretary shall make reasonable efforts \r\nto obtain relevant records that the claimant adequately \r\nidentifies to the Secretary and authorizes the Secretary to \r\nobtain, to include, the claimant's service medical records \r\nand, if the claimant has furnished the Secretary information \r\nsufficient to locate such records, other relevant records \r\npertaining to the claimant's active military, naval, or air \r\nservice that are held or maintained by a governmental entity.  \r\nPub. L. No. 106-475, � 4, 114 Stat. 2096, 2098-99 (2000) (to \r\nbe codified as amended at 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A).  Therefore, \r\nthe Board agrees that morning reports should be obtained in \r\nan effort to verify the veteran's stressors.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED to the RO for the \r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n1. The veteran should be asked once again \r\nto provide as much detail as possible \r\nconcerning his alleged service \r\nstressors, to include the names of \r\nindividuals and casualties involved, \r\nunit designations, dates, and \r\nlocations.  He should also be asked to \r\nobtain and submit any pertinent \r\nstatements he can obtain from fellow \r\nveterans who may be able to \r\ncorroborate events he has described \r\nfrom service.  \r\n\r\n2. The RO should contact the National \r\nPersonnel Records Center in St. Louis, \r\nand request the morning reports of \r\nHeadquarters Company, 4th Marines, 3rd \r\nMarine Division for the months of \r\nApril 1969 and August 1969.  \r\n\r\n3. Then, the RO should undertake any \r\nother development it determines to be \r\nwarranted to comply with the notice \r\nand duty to assist provisions of the \r\nVCAA.  \r\n\r\n4. Then, the RO should readjudicate the \r\nveteran's claim for service \r\nconnection.  If the benefit sought on \r\nappeal is not granted to the veteran's \r\nsatisfaction, the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative should be issued a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case and \r\nafforded an appropriate opportunity to \r\nrespond.  The case should then be \r\nreturned to the Board for further \r\nappellate action, if otherwise in \r\norder.  \r\nNo action is required of the veteran until he receives \r\nfurther notice.  By this remand the Board intimates no \r\nopinion as to any final outcome warranted.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter the Board has remanded to the RO.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment by the RO.  \r\nThe law requires that all claims that are remanded by the \r\nBoard of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or \r\nother appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious \r\nmanner.

Kammel, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from November 1968 to April \r\n1971.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the \r\nBoard) on appeal from a March 1997 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in St. \r\nPetersburg, Florida (the RO). \r\n\r\nIn May 1999, the veteran testified before the undersigned \r\nBoard member at a hearing conducted at the RO in St. \r\nPetersburg, Florida.  A copy of the hearing transcript has \r\nbeen associated with the claims file.  In July 1999, the \r\nBoard remanded this case for additional evidentiary \r\ndevelopment, to include a VA examination.  A VA examination \r\nwas conducted in January 2000 and the case has been returned \r\nfor final appellate review. \r\n\r\nIn a May 2001 written argument, the veteran's representative \r\nraised the issue of whether clear and unmistakable error \r\n(CUE) was shown in a rating action dated in September 1981.  \r\nThat issue has not been developed for appellate review and is \r\nreferred to the RO for appropriate action.\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  In an October 1982 decision, the Board denied the \r\nveteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD.\r\n\r\n2.  Evidence added to the record since the October 1982 Board \r\ndecision includes evidence which is not redundant or \r\ncumulative of evidence previously of record and is so \r\nsignificant that it must be considered in order to fairly \r\ndecide the merits of the claim of entitlement to service \r\nconnection for PTSD.\r\n\r\n3.  The weight of the medical evidence does not support a \r\nfinding that the veteran currently has PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\n1.  Evidence submitted since the Board's October 1982 \r\ndecision denying service connection for PTSD is new and \r\nmaterial.  The claim of entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD is reopened.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5108, 7104 (West 1991); \r\n38 C.F.R. �� 3.156, 20.1100 (2000).\r\n\r\n2.  PTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by active service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �1110 (West Supp. 2000); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, \r\n3.304 (2000).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThe veteran is seeking to reopen a claim of entitlement to \r\nservice connection for PTSD.  As an initial matter, the Board \r\nmust determine whether new and material evidence which is \r\nsufficient to reopen the veteran's previously-denied claim \r\nhas been submitted.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of clarity, the Board will review the law and \r\nrelevant VA regulations, followed by a discussion of the \r\nfactual background of this case. The Board will conclude with \r\nan analysis of the issue on appeal.\r\n\r\nRelevant law and regulations\r\n\r\nService connection - in general\r\n\r\nA disability may be service-connected if it results from an \r\ninjury or disease incurred in, or aggravated by, military \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.\r\nNotwithstanding the above, service connection may be granted \r\nfor disability shown after service, when all of the evidence, \r\nincluding that pertinent to service, shows that it was \r\nincurred in service.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d) (2000); Cosman \r\nv. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 303, 305 (1992).\r\n\r\n\r\nThere must be a current disability in order for service \r\nconnection to be granted.\r\nSee Chelte v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1997); Rabideau \r\nv. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 144 (1992).\r\n\r\nCongenital or developmental defects such as personality \r\ndisorders are not diseases or injuries for the purposes of \r\nservice connection.  38 C.F.R. �� 3.303(c), 4.9 (2000).  See \r\nWinn v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 510, 516 (1996), and cases cited \r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nThe law provides that drug and alcohol abuse cannot itself be \r\nservice connected on a direct basis. 38 U.S.C.A. � 105(a) \r\n(West 1991); see also VAOPGCPREC 7-99 (1999); VAOPGCPREC 2-98 \r\n(1998). \r\n\r\nService connection - PTSD\r\n\r\nFor service connection to be awarded for PTSD, three elements \r\nmust be present: (1) a current medical diagnosis of PTSD; (2) \r\nmedical evidence of a causal nexus between current \r\nsymptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor; and (3) \r\ncredible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service \r\nstressor actually occurred. 38 C.F.R. 3.304(f); Moreau v. \r\nBrown, 9 Vet. App. 389 (1996).\r\n\r\nIn Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91 (1993), the Court set \r\nforth the analytical framework and line of reasoning for \r\ndetermining whether a veteran was exposed to a recognizable \r\nstressor during service, which, as discussed above, is an \r\nessential element in solidifying a claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD.  In Zarycki, it was noted that, under 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. 1154(b), 38 C.F.R. 3.304(d) and (f), and the \r\napplicable provisions contained in VA Manual 21-1, the \r\nevidence necessary to establish the incurrence of a \r\nrecognizable stressor during service to support a claim of \r\nservice connection for PTSD will vary depending on whether \r\nthe veteran \"engaged in combat with the enemy.\"  See Hayes v. \r\nBrown, 5 Vet. App. 60 (1993). If combat is affirmatively \r\nindicated, then the veteran's lay testimony regarding claimed \r\ncombat-related stressors must be accepted as conclusive as to \r\ntheir actual occurrence and no further development or \r\ncorroborative evidence will be required, provided that the \r\nveteran's testimony is found to be \"satisfactory,\" i.e., \r\ncredible, and \"consistent with the circumstances, conditions, \r\nor hardships of such service.\"  Zarycki, 6 Vet. App. at 98.\r\n\r\nFinality/new and material evidence\r\n\r\nThe veteran has petitioned to reopen a previously denied \r\nservice connection claim for PTSD.  The Board's October 1982 \r\ndecision which denied service connection for PTSD is final. \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 7104 (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. � 20.1100 (1982).\r\n\r\nPursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. � 5108 (West 1991), finally \r\ndisallowed claim may be reopened when new and material \r\nevidence is presented or secured with respect to that claim.  \r\nKightly v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 200 (1994).  Only evidence \r\npresented since the last final denial on any basis (either \r\nupon the merits of the case, or upon a previous adjudication \r\nthat no new and material evidence had been presented), will \r\nbe evaluated in the context of the entire record.  Evans v. \r\nBrown, 9 Vet. App. 273 (1996).\r\n\r\nNew and material evidence is defined as evidence not \r\npreviously submitted to agency decisionmakers which bears \r\ndirectly and substantially upon the specific matter under \r\nconsideration; which is neither cumulative nor redundant; and \r\nwhich by itself or in connection with evidence previously \r\nassembled is so significant that it must be considered in \r\norder to fairly decide the merits of the claim.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.156(a) (2000).\r\n\r\nIn Elkins v. West, 12 Vet. App. 209 (1999), the United States \r\nCourt of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the \r\nBoard must first determine whether the veteran has presented \r\nnew and material evidence under 38 C.F.R. � 3.156(a) in order \r\nto have a finally denied claim reopened under \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5108.  Then, if new and material evidence has \r\nbeen submitted, the Board may proceed to evaluate the merits \r\nof the claim but only after ensuring VA's duty to assist has \r\nbeen fulfilled.  See Vargas-Gonzalez v. West, 12 Vet. App. \r\n321, 325 (1999).\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of establishing whether new and material \r\nevidence has been submitted, the credibility of the evidence, \r\nalthough not its weight, is to be presumed.  Justus v. \r\nPrincipi, 3 Vet. App. 510, 513 (1992).\r\n\r\nThe VCAA\r\n\r\nThe Board observes that the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of \r\n2000 [VCAA], Pub. L. No. 106-475, � 3(a), 114 Stat. 2096, \r\n(2000) [to be codified at 38 U.S.C. � 5103A], pertaining to \r\nVA's duty to assist veterans in the development of their \r\nclaims, appears to have left intact the requirement that a \r\nveteran must first present new and material evidence in order \r\nto reopen a previously and finally denied claim under \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5108 before the Board may determine whether the \r\nduty to assist is fulfilled and proceeding to evaluate the \r\nmerits of that claim.  It is specifically noted that nothing \r\nin the Act shall be construed to require the Secretary to \r\nreopen a claim that has been disallowed except when new and \r\nmaterial evidence is presented or secured, as described in \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5108.  See 38 U.S.C. � 5103A(f). \r\n\r\nOnce a claim is reopened, the VCAA provides that the \r\nSecretary shall make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant \r\nin obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the \r\nclaimant's claim for a benefit under a law administered by \r\nthe Secretary, unless no reasonable possibility exists that \r\nsuch assistance would aid in substantiating the claim.  \r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-475, \r\n� 3(a), 114 Stat. 2096, __ (2000) [to be codified at \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A].    \r\n\r\nFactual background\r\n\r\nEvidence of record in October 1982\r\n\r\nThe veteran's DD 214 reflects that he served in Vietnam from \r\nJune 21, 1969 to June 20, 1970.  The veteran was awarded the \r\nCombat Infantryman Badge (CIB). \r\n\r\nService medical records reveal that the veteran underwent a \r\npsychiatric examination in January 1971.  At that time, it \r\nwas noted that the vetearn had received disciplinary action \r\nfor striking a superior officer and failing to obey a lawful \r\norder.  At the time of the examination, the veteran was noted \r\nto have been angry and unmotivated because of his low rank.  \r\nThere was no evidence of any mental disease, defect or \r\nderangement.  He was considered to be mentally responsible as \r\nhe was able to distinguish right from wrong and to adhere to \r\nthe right.  A diagnosis of chronic moderate immature \r\npersonality manifested by a lack of motivation, poor impulse \r\ncontrol, and an inability to control his anger was recorded.  \r\nThe impairments were considered to have existed prior to \r\nservice.  An administrative discharge was recommended.  A \r\npsychiatric examination at discharge was normal.  \r\n\r\nVA treatment and hospital reports, dating from September 1975 \r\nto November 1980, pertinently reflect various diagnoses such \r\nas inadequate personality, acute alcoholism, alcohol abuse, \r\nundifferentiated schizophrenia in remission, personality \r\ndisorder, and dysthymic disorder.  These reports do not \r\nreflect a diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\nA July 1981 VA neuropsychiatric examination report reflects \r\nthat the veteran reported having suffered numerous life \r\nthreatening situations while he was in Vietnam.  However, he \r\ndid not provide any details or describe these situations.  \r\nAfter a mental status examination, a diagnosis of post \r\ntraumatic stress syndrome and inadequate personality disorder \r\nwere recorded by the examining physician.  The examiner \r\nfurther commented that the veteran's anxiety was manifested \r\nthrough out the years by the use of alcohol and drugs and \r\nthat the veteran had post traumatic stress syndrome and a \r\nbasic inadequate personality. \r\n\r\nA VA special psychiatric examination was conducted in \r\nSeptember 1981.  At that time, the veteran complained of \r\nparanoia and flashbacks relating to his Vietnam experience.  \r\nThe veteran reported that he had abused drugs and alcohol \r\nsubsequent to discharge from service.  After a mental status \r\nexamination, diagnoses of mixed sociopathic schizoid \r\npersonality disorder, borderline intellectual functioning and \r\nmultiple substance abuse, including alcohol and drugs were \r\nrecorded.  An opinion was expressed by a board of two \r\npsychiatrists that there was no evidence of Vietnam stress \r\nsyndrome in the veteran but that he did show a severe long-\r\nterm personality disorder correlated with the use of \r\nsubstance abuse.\r\n\r\nThe October 1982 Board decision\r\n\r\nIn October 1982, the Board denied entitlement to service \r\nconnection for PTSD.\r\nIn essence, the Board concluded that the evidence did not \r\nestablish that the veteran had a diagnosis of PTSD.  \r\n\r\nEvidence submitted after the October 1982 Board decision\r\n\r\nNumerous VA hospitalization and treatment reports, dating \r\nfrom 1993-1995, reflect continuing treatment for alcohol \r\ndependency and borderline personality traits, among other \r\ndisorders.  Of specific note is a November 1995 VA treatment \r\nreport reflecting an impression by the examining physician \r\nthat the veteran appeared to endorse some symptoms consistent \r\nwith the diagnosis of PTSD.  \r\n\r\nAn August 1997 VA medical report, submitted by G.C. M.D., \r\nreflects that a diagnosis of PTSD was to be ruled out.  \r\nDiagnoses of borderline personality disorder and a history of \r\nsubstance abuse were also recorded.\r\n\r\nAlso of record is VA form 10-0360, received by the RO in July \r\n1997, reflecting that the veteran was seen by a Dr. C in \r\nFebruary 1999 and that the block marked PTSD had been checked \r\nas a primary diagnosis.  However, there was no clarifying \r\ninformation or reasoning provided for the diagnosis of PTSD \r\nby Dr. C.\r\n\r\nIn May 1999, the veteran testified before the undersigned \r\nBoard member at a personal hearing.  The veteran in essence \r\ncontended that he had PTSD as a result of his wartime service \r\nin Vietnam.  He reported that he was ambushed, received \r\nmortar and sniper rounds, saw firefights and loaded dead \r\nbodies on helicopters.  The veteran reported that he had been \r\ndiagnosed as having PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe Board remanded this case in July 1999 so that the veteran \r\ncould be scheduled for a VA examination in order to determine \r\nwhether he had PTSD.  The RO was also requested to contact \r\nthe veteran in order to obtain any additional private or VA \r\nrecords, especially the records of Dr. C. \r\n\r\nIn a letter, dated in December 1999, the RO requested that \r\nthe veteran provide them with any additional medical \r\nevidence, private or VA, especially any records that he might \r\nhave in his possession from Dr. C.  The RO indicated that the \r\nevidence should be furnished as soon as possible, preferably \r\nwithin 60 days from the date of the letter.  The veteran did \r\nnot respond to the RO's request.  \r\n\r\nThe RO provided the veteran with a VA PTSD examination in \r\nJanuary 2000.  After a review of the claims file and an \r\nexamination of the veteran, the examiner concluded that there \r\nwas no indication that the veteran had PTSD.  The examiner \r\ndetermined that the veteran seemed to indicate problems with \r\nalcohol which he had tried to minimize and had affected his \r\nintellectual functioning.  The examiner also noted that there \r\nwas a history of psychotic-like manifestations perhaps \r\nrelated to his alcohol intake, but that the veteran was free \r\nof psychotic symptoms at the time of the examination.  The \r\nveteran was also found to have showed an immature type of \r\npersonality which had created an influence in his behavior \r\nand reactions to his life.  Diagnoses of chronic alcoholism, \r\npsychosis, not otherwise specified by history, personality \r\ndisorder not otherwise specified with immature type of \r\nfeatures were entered.\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nNew and material evidence\r\n\r\nThe evidence of record in October 1982 may be summarized as \r\nindicating that the veteran was not shown to have a diagnosis \r\nof PTSD related to his Vietnam service or any incident \r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nSince the October 1982 Board decision, evidence has been \r\nsubmitted documenting a diagnosis of PTSD.  The Board \r\nobserves in passing that during the pendency of this appeal, \r\nthe requirement for a \"clear\" diagnosis of PTSD has been \r\neliminated from the language of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\nCompare 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1990) and (2000).\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of PTSD by Dr. C [in that a box entitled \"PTSD\" \r\nbeing checked on a VA Form 10-0360, listing diagnoses] \r\nclearly bears directly and substantially on the specific \r\nmatter under consideration, i.e., whether the veteran has \r\nPTSD.  This diagnosis is neither cumulative nor redundant, as \r\nit was not previously of record.  Given the nature of this \r\nmedical evidence, the Board finds that the diagnosis is by \r\nitself so significant that it must be considered in order to \r\nfairly decide the merits of the claim.  38 C.F.R. � 3.156(a) \r\n(2000).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the veteran's claim of entitlement to service \r\nconnection for PTSD is reopened based on the submission of \r\nnew and material evidence.  The Board notes at this point \r\nthat new evidence may be sufficient to reopen a claim because \r\nit  contributes to a more complete picture of the \r\ncircumstances surrounding the origin of a veteran's injury or \r\ndisability, even though it may not be enough to convince the \r\nBoard to grant a claim.  See Hodge v. West, \r\n155 F.3d 1356, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 1998). \r\nThe Board will now move on to address the veteran's claim on \r\na de novo basis.\r\n\r\nDecision on the merits\r\n\r\n(i.)  Preliminary matters\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further, the Board must consider whether \r\nthe cautions of the United States Court of Appeals for \r\nVeterans Claims (Court) in Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384 \r\n(1993) apply [when the Board addresses in its decision a \r\nquestion that has not been addressed by the RO, it must \r\nconsider whether the appellant has been given adequate notice \r\nto respond and, if not, whether he has been prejudiced \r\nthereby].  In this case, the veteran has been given ample \r\nopportunity to provide evidence and argument in support of \r\nhis claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD, \r\nincluding presenting his testimony as to the merits of the \r\nissue of service connection for PTSD at a personal hearing.  \r\nMoreover, the RO initially addressed this claim on the \r\nmerits, as if no previous final decision had been rendered.  \r\nSee the January 2001 Supplemental Statement of the Case. \r\n\r\nAs noted above, once the veteran's claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD is reopened, the VCAA provides that VA \r\nshall make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in \r\nobtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the claimant's \r\nclaim for a benefit under a law administered by the \r\nSecretary, unless no reasonable possibility exists that such \r\nassistance would aid in substantiating the claim.  Veterans \r\nClaims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub.L. NO. 106-475, � 3(a), \r\n114 Stat. 2096_(2000) [to be codified at 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5103A].  In this case, subsequent to the Board's July 1999 \r\nremand request, the veteran was requested to provide \r\nadditional medical evidence, especially the records from Dr. \r\nC to support his claim for PTSD.  However, no further \r\nevidence was submitted by the veteran.  In addition, the \r\nveteran was provided a very thorough VA PTSD examination in \r\nJanuary 2000 which specifically addressed the question on \r\nwhether or not he had PTSD.  Therefore, for the reasons \r\nstated above, the Board concludes that VA's duty to assist \r\nthe veteran has been satisfied in this case.\r\n\r\nGenerally, any pertinent evidence submitted by the veteran or \r\nhis representative which is accepted by the Board must be \r\nreferred to the agency of original jurisdiction for review \r\nand preparation of a supplemental statement of the case \r\nunless this procedural right is waived.  38 C.F.R. � \r\n20.1304(c) (2000).  In this case, after a Supplemental \r\nStatement of the Case was issued in January 2000, a VA \r\ninterview report of the veteran, dated in December 2000, was \r\nassociated with the claims file and was not accompanied by a \r\nwaiver of RO consideration.  However, the Board believes that \r\nthis report is not \"pertinent\" to the claim on appeal within \r\nthe meaning of 38 C.F.R. � 20.1304, as it relates primarily \r\nto the competency of the veteran and not to the issue of \r\nwhether or not the veteran has PTSD.  Thus, the Board finds \r\nthat consideration of this material by the RO pursuant to 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 20. 1304 (2000) is not necessary.\r\n\r\n(ii.)  Discussion\r\n\r\nThere is no question that stressors existed.  The veteran has \r\nbeen recognized as being a combat veteran.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d), (f).  The question which is \r\ncrucial to this case is whether the veteran has PTSD.  Under \r\ncurrent law service connection may not be granted unless a \r\ncurrent disability exists.  See, e.g., Degmetich v. Brown, \r\n104 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Gilpin v. Brown, 155 F.3d \r\n1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998).\r\n\r\nIn this case, there is only one diagnosis of PTSD, which is \r\nshown on VA form 10-0360.  On that form, a block marked \r\n\"PTSD\"  was checked as a primary diagnosis by G.C., M.D.  \r\nHowever, there is no clarifying information or explanation \r\nfor the apparent diagnosis of PTSD.  As noted above, efforts \r\nwere made by the Board and the RO to secure clarifying \r\ninformation, to no avail.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the medical record is devoid of any \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD.  As indicated in the factual background \r\nsection above, other diagnoses have been proffered by \r\nexamining and treating physicians over the years, to include \r\npersonality disorder and alcohol abuse.    \r\n\r\nThe Board places great weight of probative value on the \r\nfindings of the VA psychiatrist in January 2000, which was \r\nthe result of the Board's remand for specific medical \r\nguidance as to this question.  The examiner thoroughly \r\nreviewed the veteran's history, examined the veteran and \r\nspecifically ruled out a diagnosis of PTSD.  In particular, \r\nthe Board notes that the January 2000 VA psychiatrist \r\ndetermined that although some of his clinical symptoms were \r\nconsistent with PTSD, the veteran seemed to indicate problems \r\nwith alcohol.  The psychiatrist also concluded that the \r\nveteran had a history of psychotic-like manifestations in the \r\npast, perhaps related to his alcohol intake and an immature \r\ntype of personality which had influenced his behavior and \r\nreactions throughout his life. \r\n\r\nThe Board observes that the conclusions of the January 2000 \r\nVA psychiatrist are consistent with and supported by earlier \r\nfindings in the service medical records of problems with \r\nauthority and a personality disorder.  In addition, the post-\r\nservice medical record is replete with numerous VA treatment \r\nand hospitalization reports, dating from the mid-1970's to \r\nthe mid-1990's, reflecting the veteran's long standing \r\nhistory of substance abuse.  \r\n\r\nThe Board further finds that the conclusions of the January \r\n2000 VA psychiatrist is supported by the earlier findings of \r\nthe September 1981 VA Board psychiatrists, who also \r\nconsidered the veteran's medical history but determined that \r\nthere was no evidence of \"post traumatic stress syndrome\" \r\nbut that the veteran showed a long-term personality disorder, \r\ncorrelated with multiple substance abuse.  \r\n\r\nAs noted above, the only medical evidence that PTSD exists \r\nthe merely a box on a form entitled \"PTSD\" being checked.  \r\nThis is outweighed by the remainder of the medical evidence, \r\ndiscussed above.  Although the veteran himself contends that \r\nhe has PTSD, it is now well-established that as a layperson \r\nwithout medical training he is not qualified to render \r\nmedical opinions regarding the diagnosis of disorders and \r\ndisabilities, and his opinion is entitled to no weight.  See \r\nEspiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 495 (1992).\r\n\r\nThe Board concludes, for the reasons and bases expressed \r\nabove, that the preponderance of the evidence is against \r\nfinding that the veteran suffers from PTSD.  The veteran's \r\nclaim is accordingly denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nThe claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD is \r\ndenied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tBarry F.

Herman, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active military service from November 1944 to \r\nNovember 1946.\r\n\r\nThis matter came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal of a July 1991 rating decision by the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  \r\n\r\nThis matter was REMANDED by a member of the Board in October \r\n1993 and March 1996 for the purpose of obtaining additional \r\nfactual and medical evidence.  The claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD was subsequently denied by the Board in \r\nNovember 1996.  However, this decision was vacated by the \r\nBoard in July 2001 based on the determination that there had \r\nbeen a due process violation in the November 1996 decision.  \r\nSee 38 C.F.R. � 20.904 (2000).\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn its March 1996 REMAND, the Board directed the RO to \r\ncontact the veteran and request that he complete a \r\nQuestionnaire About Military Service (NA Form 13075), and to \r\nattempt to verify the veteran's purported in-service \r\nstressors through the U.S. Army and Joint Services \r\nEnvironmental Support Group (ESG) [now named the United \r\nStates Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records \r\n(USASCRUR)].  Although the RO had previously attempted to \r\nverify the veteran's alleged stressors through the USASCRUR, \r\nits request to the USASCRUR did not adequately identify the \r\nveteran's claimed stressors.  Pursuant to the Board's remand, \r\na letter was mailed to the veteran on March 21, 1996, which \r\nasked him to complete the NA Form 13075.  He was told that he \r\nhad 60 days from the date of the letter to respond and that \r\nthe matter would be returned to the Board without further \r\ndevelopment if he failed to respond within 60 days.  A \r\ncompleted NA Form 13075 was apparently received by the RO on \r\nApril 3, 1996, but for reasons unclear to the Board, was not \r\nassociated with the claims folder until some time after the \r\nBoard's November 1996 decision.  In addition, the RO failed \r\nto comply with the Board's directive to attempt to verify the \r\nveteran's claimed in-service stressors through USASCRUR.  \r\n\r\nThe RO is advised that the Board is obligated by law to \r\nensure that the RO complies with its directives, as well as \r\nthose of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \r\n(Court).  The Court has stated that compliance by the Board \r\nor the RO is neither optional nor discretionary.  Where the \r\nremand orders of the Board or the Court are not complied \r\nwith, the Board errs as a matter of law when it fails to \r\nensure compliance.  Stegall v. West, 11 Vet.App. 268 (1998).  \r\n\r\nFinally, the Board notes that during the pendency of the \r\nveteran's appeal but after the RO's most recent consideration \r\nof the veteran's claim, the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of \r\n2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000), was \r\nsigned into law.  This liberalizing law is applicable to the \r\nveteran's claim.  See Karnas v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 308, \r\n312-13 (1991).  It essentially eliminates the requirement \r\nthat a claimant submit evidence of a well-grounded claim, and \r\nprovides that VA will assist a claimant in obtaining evidence \r\nnecessary to substantiate a claim but is not required to \r\nprovide assistance to a claimant if there is no reasonable \r\npossibility that such assistance would aid in substantiating \r\nthe claim.  It also includes new notification provisions.  \r\nSpecifically, it requires VA to notify the claimant and the \r\nclaimant's representative, if any, of any information, and \r\nany medical or lay evidence, not previously provided to the \r\nSecretary that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  As \r\npart of the notice, VA is to specifically inform the claimant \r\nand the claimant's representative, if any, of which portion, \r\nif any, of the evidence is to be provided by the claimant and \r\nwhich part, if any, VA will attempt to obtain on behalf of \r\nthe claimant.\r\n\r\nIn light of these circumstances, this case is REMANDED to the \r\nRO for the following:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should request that the veteran submit \r\nthe names, addresses and approximate dates of \r\ntreatment or evaluation for all VA and non-VA \r\nmedical care providers who have treated or \r\nevaluated him since his service separation for any \r\npsychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.  After \r\nsecuring any necessary releases, the RO should \r\nattempt to obtain a copy of any indicated records \r\nwhich have not been obtained previously.\r\n\r\n2.  If the RO is unable to obtain a copy of any \r\nrecords identified by the veteran, it should so \r\ninform the veteran and his representative of this \r\nand request them to provide a copy of such \r\nrecords.\r\n\r\n3.  The completed NA Form 13075, which was \r\nreceived from the veteran in April 1996, should be \r\nforwarded to the National Personnel Records Center \r\n(NPRC).  An attempt to obtain copies of morning \r\nreports for the veteran's unit(s) for the \r\nperiod(s) in question should be made.  An attempt \r\nshould also be made to obtain any personnel \r\nrecords indicating the veteran's location and \r\nduties during the period in question, not already \r\ncontained in the claims folder.  \r\n\r\n4.  The RO should then review the file and prepare \r\na summary of the veteran's claimed stressors, to \r\ninclude any additional information received from \r\nthe veteran concerning his claimed stressors.  \r\nThis summary, a copy of any stressor statements \r\nfrom the veteran, and a copy of any pertinent \r\npersonnel records should be sent to the U.S. Armed \r\nServices Center for Research of Unit Records \r\n(USASCRUR), 7798 Cissna Road, Suite 101, \r\nSpringfield, Virginia 22150-3197, for verification \r\nof the veteran's alleged stressors.  In doing so, \r\nthe RO should provide as much detailed information \r\nregarding the veteran's service as possible, \r\nincluding the units listed in paragraph 3, page 2, \r\nof the Board's October 1993 remand (with 81st \r\nDivision and Signal Battalion corrected to 88th \r\nDivision and Signal Battalion).\r\n\r\n5.  The RO should then carefully review all \r\nevidence obtained pursuant to the development \r\nrequested above.  In the event these records \r\nsuggest the presence of other sources of relevant \r\nevidence, such leads should be followed to their \r\nlogical conclusion.\r\n\r\n6.  The veteran should be requested to submit \r\ncorroborating evidence of his alleged \r\nstressors, such as statements from persons who \r\nserved with him and have knowledge of the \r\nalleged stressors.\r\n\r\n7.  Upon completion of the above development, \r\nthe veteran should be afforded a VA \r\nexamination by a psychiatrist to determine if \r\nhe has PTSD which is etiologically related to \r\nhis military service.  Any indicated studies, \r\ntests and evaluations should be performed.  A \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD under DSM IV criteria should \r\nbe made or ruled out.  If PTSD is diagnosed, \r\nthe examiner should identify the specific \r\nstressor(s) supporting the diagnosis.  If PTSD \r\nis not diagnosed, the examiner should explain \r\nwhy the veteran does not meet the criteria for \r\nthis diagnosis. The claims folder, to include \r\na copy of this Remand and any additional \r\nevidence secured, must be made available to \r\nthe examiner for proper review of the medical \r\nhistory.  The examination report is to reflect \r\nthat such a review of the claims folder was \r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe veteran should be notified of the date, time, \r\nand place of the examination in writing, and a \r\ncopy of the notification letter should be included \r\nin the claims folder.\r\n\r\n8.  Then, the RO should review the claims \r\nfolder and ensure that all of the foregoing \r\ndevelopment has been conducted and completed \r\nin full.  If any development is incomplete, \r\nappropriate corrective action is to be \r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n9.  Then, the RO should undertake any other \r\ndevelopment it deems to be required to comply \r\nwith the notice and duty to assist provisions \r\nof the VCAA.\r\n\r\n10.  Then, the RO should readjudicate the \r\nissue on appeal.  If the benefit sought on \r\nappeal is not granted to the veteran's \r\nsatisfaction, the RO should issue a \r\nSupplemental Statement of the Case and afford \r\nthe veteran and his representative an \r\nappropriate opportunity to respond.\r\n\r\nThereafter, subject to current appellate procedures, the case \r\nshould be returned to the Board for further appellate \r\nconsideration, if appropriate.  No action is required of the \r\nveteran until he is otherwise notified by the RO.  By this \r\nremand, the Board intimates no opinion, either factual or \r\nlegal, as to any ultimate conclusion warranted in this case.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter the Board has remanded to the RO.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment by the RO.  \r\nThe law requires that all claims that are remanded by the \r\nBoard of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or \r\nother appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious \r\nmanner.  See The Veterans' Benefits Improvements Act of 1994, \r\nPub. L. No. 103-446, � 302, 108 Stat. 4645, 4658 (1994), \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5101 (West Supp. 2001) (Historical and \r\nStatutory Notes).  In addition, VBA's Adjudication Procedure \r\nManual, M21-1, Part IV, directs the ROs to provide \r\nexpeditious handling of all cases that have been remanded by \r\nthe Board and the Court.

Zills, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from July 1943 to June \r\n1947, and from February 1951 to February 1953.\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\nfrom a March 1999 RO decision which denied service connection \r\nfor PTSD.  At an RO hearing in June 1999, the veteran claimed \r\nthat service connection should be granted for any psychiatric \r\ndisorder, not just PTSD.  In September 1999, the RO denied \r\nservice connection for any psychiatric disorder, including \r\nPTSD.  A Board hearing on this issue was held at the RO (a \r\nTravel Board hearing) in June 2001.  The Board finds that the \r\nissue on appeal is service connection for any psychiatric \r\ndisorder, including PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe current claims file indicates that the initial claims \r\nfile was lost, and the current claims file is a \"rebuilt\" one \r\ncontaining only partial records.  At his Board hearing, the \r\nveteran submitted some records showing that service \r\nconnection for depression was denied by the RO in October \r\n1987 and by the Board in January 1989, but no additional \r\ninformation on past adjudications is currently available.  \r\nUnder the circumstances, the claim for service connection for \r\na psychiatric disorder, including PTSD, will be reviewed on a \r\nde novo basis.\r\n\r\nIn June 1999, the veteran withdrew an appeal of an issue of \r\nservice connection for \"radiation exposure,\" and thus that \r\nissue is not before the Board.  38 C.F.R. � 20.204 (2001).\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe current rebuilt claims folder does not contain the \r\nveteran's service medical records.  Some medical records from \r\nafter service have been submitted, including records dated in \r\nand after 1975 which show variously diagnosed psychiatric \r\nconditions.  A VA psychiatric examination was provided in \r\nDecember 1998 and January 1999, and the diagnosis was \r\ndepression; it was found the veteran did not meet the \r\ndiagnostic criteria for PTSD.  This VA examination, however, \r\nwas performed before the veteran submitted many records of \r\npast psychiatric treatment.  In an August 2001 report, a \r\nprivate psychologist, Dr. George V. Komaridis diagnosed the \r\nveteran as having an anxiety disorder not otherwise \r\nspecified, and suggested that such diagnosis may be \r\nassociated with traumatic events experienced by the veteran \r\nwhile in service. \r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the original claims folder has been \r\nlost, and given the duty to assist requirements of the \r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-475, \r\n114 Stat. 2096 (2000), and a recently enacted companion VA \r\nregulation, further development of the evidence is warranted.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A (West Supp.); 66 Fed.Reg. 45,620, 45,630 \r\n(Aug. 29, 2001) (to be codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.159).  Further efforts should be made to obtain pertinent \r\nrecords from during and after service, and another VA \r\nexamination should be provided.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is remanded for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should again attempt to locate \r\nthe original VA claims folder which has \r\nbeen lost.\r\n\r\n2.  The RO should ascertain whether the \r\nservice department has any copies of the \r\nveteran's service medical records; if so, \r\nthey should be obtained.\r\n\r\n3.  The RO should ask the veteran to \r\nidentify (names, locations, dates) all \r\nmedical providers who treated him at any \r\ntime for psychiatric problems after \r\nservice, and the RO should obtain copies \r\nof related medical records which are not \r\nalready on file.\r\n\r\n4.  The RO should also ask the veteran \r\nand his representative to submit copies \r\nof any records in their possession \r\nconcerning past VA adjudications prior to \r\nthe original claims folder being lost.\r\n\r\n5.  The RO should ask the Social Security \r\nAdministration (SSA) to provide any \r\nmedical and other records considered in \r\nawards of SSA disability benefits to the \r\nveteran, along with copies of the related \r\nSSA decisions.  (At his last VA \r\nexamination, the veteran related he \r\nreceived SSA disability benefits from \r\n1975 to 1983.)\r\n\r\n6.  The RO should undertake appropriate \r\ndevelopment to verify the veteran's \r\nalleged service stressors for PTSD.\r\n\r\n7.  Thereafter, the veteran should \r\nundergo another VA psychiatric \r\nexamination to determine the nature and \r\netiology of all psychiatric disorders, \r\nincluding PTSD.  The claims folder must \r\nbe provided to and reviewed by the \r\ndoctor, and the examination report should \r\nnote that such has been accomplished.  \r\nAll current psychiatric disorders should \r\nbe diagnosed in accordance with the \r\ncriteria of DSM-IV.  Based on examination \r\nfindings, a review of historical records, \r\nand medical principles, the doctor should \r\nprovide a medical opinion, with full \r\nrationale, as to the date of onset and \r\netiology of all psychiatric disorders, \r\nincluding any relationship with service.\r\n\r\n8.  The RO should then review the claim \r\nfor service connection for a psychiatric \r\ndisorder, including PTSD.  If the claim \r\nremains denied, the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative should be provided with a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case, and \r\ngiven an opportunity to respond, before \r\nthe case is returned to the Board.\r\n\r\nOn remand, the veteran may submit any other evidence and \r\nargument on the matter the Board has remanded to the RO.  \r\nKutscherousky v.

W. Loeb, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the \r\nBoard) on appeal of a February 2000 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nSt. Louis, Missouri which denied the veteran's claim of \r\nentitlement to service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy, and \r\nthere is no credible evidence corroborating any of the \r\nveteran's alleged service stressors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by the veteran's \r\nmilitary service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131 (West 1991 and \r\nSupp. 2001); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2001).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends, in essence, that he has PTSD as a \r\nresult of his experiences in Vietnam and Korea and that he \r\nshould therefore be granted service connection for that \r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nBy law, the Board's statement of reasons and bases for its \r\nfindings and conclusions on all material facts and law \r\npresented on the record must be sufficient to enable the \r\nclaimant to understand the precise basis for the Board's \r\ndecision, as well as to facilitate review of the decision by \r\ncourts of competent appellate jurisdiction.  The Board must \r\nalso consider discuss all applicable statutory and regulatory \r\nlaw, as well as the controlling decisions of the appellate \r\ncourts.  See Vargas-Gonzalez v. West, 12 Vet. App. 321, 328 \r\n(1999); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 56-57 (1990); \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 7104(d)(1) (West 1991).\r\n\r\nWith these requirements of law, the Board will first review \r\nthe evidence of record as found in the veteran's claims \r\nfolder, discuss the applicable law, and then proceed to an \r\nanalysis of the claim at issue.\r\n\r\nFactual Background\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty in the United States Air \r\nForce from January 1960 to December 1967, including service \r\nin Vietnam and Korea.  His military occupational specialty \r\nwas an electrical power specialist.  He was not awarded any \r\ncitations or medals indicative of combat.  The veteran's \r\nservice medical records do not contain any psychiatric \r\ncomplaints or findings.\r\n\r\nThere is no pertinent evidence for over two decades after the \r\nveteran left military service.\r\n\r\nIt was noted during VA hospitalization for heart disease from \r\nApril to May 1991 that the veteran had periods of anxiety.  \r\nThe diagnoses included chronic anxiety.  The veteran was \r\nhospitalized at a VA hospital from June to July 1991 due to \r\ncomplaints of dizziness and light-headedness.  He complained \r\nof depression and was given medication.  The diagnoses were \r\nanxiety overlay and depression.  The veteran was admitted to \r\na VA hospital in April 1992 with an irregular heartbeat.  The \r\ndiagnoses included severe anxiety neurosis.  VA outpatient \r\nrecords dated from May 1991 to April 1993 reveal continued \r\nproblems with anxiety.  None of these records referred to the \r\nveteran's military service as a source of his anxiety.\r\n\r\nIn April 1993, the veteran contacted the RO, requesting \r\nservice connection for PTSD \"as a result of my combat \r\nexperiences in Vietnam\".  In May 1993, the RO wrote to the \r\nveteran, requesting specifics concerning his stressful \r\nexperiences.  The veteran failed to respond to the RO's \r\nletter.\r\n\r\nThe initial diagnosis of PTSD occurred in May 1999.  The \r\nveteran reported having nightmares and flashbacks of \r\nunspecified \"atrocities\" he saw in Vietnam.  \r\n\r\nIn October 1999, the veteran filed a claim of entitlement to \r\nservice connection for PTSD with the RO.  In January 2000, \r\nthe RO wrote to the veteran, requesting specific information \r\nconcerning his alleged stressors.  The veteran did not \r\nrespond to that letter.  In February 2000, his claim was \r\ndenied by the RO.  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nIn March 2000, the veteran submitted a stressor statement to \r\nthe RO.  He reported that his father, grandfather and \r\ngrandmother died while he was in Korea.  He further reported \r\nthat shortly after he arrived in Vietnam, he was blamed when \r\nelectrical power went off, endangering aircraft which were \r\nattempting to land.  The veteran went on to state that he was \r\nostracized and vilified for that incident, which he claimed \r\nwas not his fault.  The veteran further stated that he wrote \r\nhis Congressman, which resulted in further teasing and \r\nisolation.\r\n\r\nThe veteran was evaluated by a VA counseling therapist on \r\nApril 3, 2000.   \r\nThe veteran's duties in the military involved electrical \r\npower generation and repair.  His responsibilities included \r\nmaintain power production for airbases.  He again described \r\nthe incident in Vietnam in which he was blamed, unfairly \r\naccording to him, for losing power for the base's runway \r\nlights and radar, with subsequent abuse and isolation.  The \r\nveteran's stressors were described as \"global versus event \r\nspecific\".  The examiner concluded that the veteran did not \r\nmeet the criteria for PTSD as established by DSM-IV because \r\nhe did not experience a traumatic event.  \r\n\r\n\r\nA VA outpatient treatment record dated April 13, 2000 is of \r\nrecord.  The veteran in essence reiterated the statement he \r\nsubmitted to the RO in March 2000.  The diagnosis was PTSD, \r\n\"non-combat\".  \r\n\r\nSubsequent VA outpatient records from July 2000 to February \r\n2001 reveal various diagnoses, including obsessive-compulsive \r\ndisorder, alcohol dependence, major depression and \"non \r\ncombat\" PTSD.\r\n\r\nAlso on file is a statement from the veteran's wife, received \r\nby VA in September 2000, in which she says that the veteran \r\nwas under mental stress while in service.\r\n\r\nRelevant Law and Regulations\r\n\r\nService connection - in general\r\n\r\nIn general, service connection may be granted for disability \r\nor injury incurred in or aggravated by active military \r\nservice. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131 (West 1991); \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (2001).  The resolution of this issue must \r\nbe considered on the basis of the places, types and \r\ncircumstances of his service as shown by service records, the \r\nofficial history of each organization in which the claimant \r\nserved, his medical records and all pertinent medical and lay \r\nevidence.  Determinations relative to service connection will \r\nbe based on review of the entire evidence of record.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 7104(a) (West Supp. 2001); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a) \r\n(2001); see Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 16, 19 (1991).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the lack of a diagnosis of a disability \r\nduring service, service connection may still be granted if \r\nall of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, \r\nestablishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1113(b) (West Supp. 2001); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d) \r\n(2001); Cosman v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 503, 505 (1992).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nService connection - PTSD\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\nestablishing a diagnosis of the condition, credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressors \r\nactually occurred, and a link, established by medical \r\nevidence, between the current symptomatology and the claimed \r\nin-service stressors.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nWith regard to the second criterion, the evidence necessary \r\nto establish that the claimed stressor actually occurred \r\nvaries depending on whether it can be determined that the \r\nveteran \"engaged in combat with the enemy.\"  38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n1154(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d); see Collette v. Brown, 82 F.3d \r\n389 (Fed.Cir. 1996); Gregory v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 563 \r\n(1996); Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91 (1993).\r\n\r\nCombat status\r\n\r\nIn the case of any veteran who engaged in combat with the \r\nenemy in active service with a military, naval, or air \r\norganization of the United States during a period of war, \r\ncampaign, or expedition, the Secretary shall accept as \r\nsufficient proof of service-connection of any disease or \r\ninjury alleged to have been incurred in or aggravated by such \r\nservice, satisfactory lay or other evidence of service \r\nincurrence or aggravation of such injury or disease, if \r\nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof such service, notwithstanding the fact that there is no \r\nofficial record of such incurrence or aggravation in such \r\nservice, and, to that end, shall resolve every reasonable \r\ndoubt in favor of the veteran.  Service connection of such \r\ninjury or disease may be rebutted by clear and convincing \r\nevidence to the contrary.  The reasons for granting or \r\ndenying service connection in each case shall be recorded in \r\nfull.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d).\r\n\r\nIf it is determined through military citation or other \r\nsupportive evidence that a veteran engaged in combat with the \r\nenemy, and the claimed stressors are related to combat, the \r\nveteran's lay testimony regarding the reported stressors must \r\nbe accepted as conclusive evidence as to their actual \r\noccurrence and no further development or corroborative \r\nevidence will be necessary, provided that the testimony is \r\nfound to be satisfactory and consistent with the \r\ncircumstances, conditions or hardships of such service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d), (f) \r\n(1998); Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, 289 (1994).  Service \r\ndepartment evidence that the veteran engaged in combat or \r\nthat the veteran was awarded the Purple Heart, Combat \r\nInfantryman Badge, or similar combat citation will be \r\naccepted, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as \r\nconclusive evidence of the claimed in-service stressor.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  Section 1154 requires that the veteran \r\nhave actually participated in combat with the enemy, meaning \r\nparticipated in events constituting an actual fight or \r\nencounter with a military foe or hostile unit or \r\ninstrumentality, and would not apply to veterans who served \r\nin a general \"combat area\" or \"combat zone\" but did not \r\nthemselves engage in combat with the enemy.  VAOPGCPREC 12-\r\n99.\r\n\r\nWhere a determination is made that the veteran did not \r\n\"engage in combat with the enemy,\" or the claimed stressor \r\nis not related to combat, the veteran's lay testimony alone \r\nwill not be enough to establish the occurrence of the alleged \r\nstressor.  See Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395 (1996); \r\nDizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 166  (1996).  In such \r\ncases, the record must contain service records or other \r\ncorroborative evidence which substantiates or verifies the \r\nveteran's testimony or statements as to the occurrence of the \r\nclaimed stressor.  See West (Carlton) v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. \r\n70, 76 (1994); Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 (1993).  \r\nMoreover, a medical opinion diagnosing PTSD does not suffice \r\nto verify the occurrence of the claimed in- service \r\nstressors.  Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395-396 (1996); \r\nCohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 142 (1997).\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard of review\r\n\r\nOnce the evidence has been assembled, it is the Board's \r\nresponsibility to evaluate the record on appeal.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 7104 (West 1991 and Supp. 2001).  When there is an \r\napproximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an \r\nissue material to the determination of the matter, the \r\nbenefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be \r\ngiven to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b) (West 1991); 38 \r\nC.F.R. �� 3.102, 4.3 (2001).  In Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. \r\nApp. 49, 53 (1990), the Court stated that \"a veteran need \r\nonly demonstrate that there is an 'approximate balance of \r\npositive and negative evidence' in order to prevail.\"  To \r\ndeny a claim on its merits, the evidence must preponderate \r\nagainst the claim.  Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 \r\n(1996), citing Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 54.\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nInitial matter - VA's duty to notify/assist\r\n\r\nThe Board has given consideration to the provisions of the \r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. \r\n106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000) [codified as amended at \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5100 et seq. (West 2001)].  This law redefines \r\nthe obligations of VA with respect to the duty to assist.  \r\nThe VCAA also includes an enhanced duty to notify a claimant \r\nas to the information and evidence necessary to substantiate \r\na claim for VA benefits.  Regulations implementing the VCAA \r\nhave been enacted.  See 66 Fed. Reg. 45, 620 (August 29, \r\n2001) [to be codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, \r\n3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326(a)].\r\n\r\nThe VCAA is applicable to all claims filed on or after the \r\ndate of enactment, November 9, 2000, or filed before the date \r\nof enactment and not yet final as of that date.  Except for \r\nprovisions pertaining to claims to reopen based upon the \r\nsubmission of new and material evidence, which are not \r\napplicable in the instant case, the implementing regulations \r\nare also effective November 9, 2000.  In this case, the \r\nregulations are accordingly applicable.  See Holliday v. \r\nPrincipi, 14 Vet. App. 280 (2000) [the Board must make a \r\ndetermination as to the applicability of the various \r\nprovisions of the VCAA to a particular claim].\r\n\r\nThe VCAA requires VA to notify the claimant and the \r\nclaimant's representative, if any, of any information, and \r\nany medical or lay evidence not previously provided to the \r\nSecretary that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  As \r\npart of the notice, VA is to specifically inform the claimant \r\nand the claimant's representative, if any, of which portion, \r\nif any, of the evidence is to be provided by the claimant and \r\nwhich part, if any, VA will attempt to obtain on behalf of \r\nthe claimant.\r\n\r\nAfter having carefully reviewed the record on appeal, the \r\nBoard has concluded that the requirements of the VCAA have \r\nbeen effectively satisfied with respect to the issue on \r\nappeal.  The Board observes that the veteran was informed in \r\nthe March 2000 Statement of the Case and the July 2001 \r\nSupplemental Statement of the Case of the relevant law and \r\nregulations and the type of evidence that could be submitted \r\nby him in support of his claim.  Of particular interest is \r\nthat the veteran was specifically informed by the RO in \r\nJanuary 2000 that he was obligated to provide information \r\nconcerning his stressors.  He responded in March 2000.  The \r\nveteran has been accorded ample opportunity to present \r\nevidence and argument on his own behalf.  \r\n  \r\nAfter having reviewed the record, the Board concludes that \r\nthere is sufficient evidence of record with which to make an \r\ninformed decision.  Although there is no specific VA \r\ncompensation and pension psychiatric evaluation of the \r\nveteran of record, there are numerous outpatient treatment \r\nrecords.  As indicated in the analysis section below, the \r\nBoard will assume that the veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD.  \r\nThe outcome of this case hinges on the existence of \r\nstressors, and as discussed above the veteran has been given \r\nthe opportunity top describe his stressors and he has indeed \r\ndone so. \r\n\r\nIn short, the Board has carefully considered the provisions \r\nof the VCAA in light of the record on appeal, and finds that \r\nthe development of the claim has been consistent with the \r\nprovisions of the new law.  Accordingly, the Board will \r\nproceed to a decision on the merits on the issue on appeal.  \r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nAs discussed above, 38 C.F.R. 3.304(f) sets forth the three \r\nelements required to establish service connection for PTSD.  \r\nFor service connection to be awarded for PTSD, the record \r\nmust show: (1) a current medical diagnosis of PTSD; (2) \r\nmedical evidence of a causal nexus between his PTSD and the \r\nclaimed in-service stressor; and (3) credible supporting \r\nevidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually \r\noccurred.  38 C.F.R. 3.304(f); Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. \r\n389 (1996).\r\n\r\nThere is of record a current medical diagnosis of PTSD, \r\nalthough described as \"non combat\" PTSD.  There are numerous \r\nother psychiatric diagnoses, and one examiner has \r\nspecifically ruled out PTSD.  For the purposes of this \r\ndiscussion, however, the Board will accept that there is a \r\ncurrent medical diagnosis of PTSD\r\n\r\nThe Board observes that at times the veteran has alluded to \r\nbeing in combat [April 1993] and allegedly witnessing \r\n\"atrocities\" [May 1999].  He has never been more specific, \r\ndespite being asked by VA to provide more specific \r\ninformation.  \r\nThe veteran has more recently contended that his in-service \r\nstressors involve being blamed for the loss of generator \r\npower to his base soon after his arrival in Vietnam in \r\nFebruary 1966.  The veteran has further reported that he was \r\nostracized and ridiculed after this incident.   \r\n\r\nIn evaluating the evidence and rendering a decision on the \r\nmerits, the Board is required to assess the credibility, and \r\ntherefore the probative value, of proffered evidence in the \r\ncontext of the record as a whole.  See Madden v. Gober, 125 \r\nF. 3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997).\r\n\r\nThe Board places little weight of probative value on the \r\nveteran's brief and vague statements concerning combat and \r\natrocities, which are unsupported by any evidence of record.  \r\nThe veteran has provided no meaningful information which \r\nwould provide a basis to refer this case to the U. S. Armed \r\nServices Center for Research of Unit Records for verification \r\nof any claimed stressors.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that the veteran served in combat.  His \r\nmilitary occupational specialty was electrical power \r\nspecialist in the United States Air Force.  He did not \r\nreceive any decorations or awards indicative of combat \r\nstatus.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that combat status \r\nhas not been demonstrated in this case.\r\n\r\nBecause the veteran did not engage in combat, the law \r\nrequires that stressors be corroborated.  The veteran's lay \r\ntestimony alone is not enough to establish the occurrence of \r\nan alleged stressor.  Moreover, the diagnosis of \"non combat\" \r\nPTSD does not suffice to verify the occurrence of any claimed \r\nin-service stressor.  There is no credible corroborating \r\nevidence of an in-service stressor, which is one of the \r\nelements required for entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD.  In the absence of one of the required elements under \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), the claim must be denied.\r\n\r\nIn short, for the reasons and bases expressed above the Board \r\nconcludes that a preponderance of the evidence is against the \r\nveteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD.  The benefit sought on appeal is accordingly denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tBarry F.

Hannan, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant had active service in the Marine Corps from \r\nJanuary 1969 to August 1970, as well as subsequent active \r\nservice in the Army from July 1971 to August 1979.  This case \r\noriginally came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from rating actions by the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Montgomery, Alabama that \r\ndenied the appellant's claim for service connection for post-\r\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\r\n\r\nAfter remanding the case for additional development in June \r\n1995, the Board denied the appellant's service connection \r\nclaim in a decision dated April 29, 1999.  The appellant then \r\nappealed the Board's decision to the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims (hereinafter Court).\r\n\r\nIn November 1999, based on the September 1999 Appellee's \r\nMotion for Remand and To Stay Further Proceedings that was \r\nnot opposed by the appellant, the Court vacated the April \r\n1999 Board decision and remanded the case to the Board.  The \r\nbasis for the Motion for Remand was that the Board had \r\nprovided inadequate reasons and bases for its decision, in \r\nparticular because the appellant may have engaged in combat \r\nwith the enemy.\r\n\r\nThereafter, in August 2000, the Board remanded the case to \r\nthe RO for the completion of additional development.  The RO \r\nhas now returned the case to the Board for appellate review.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  All relevant and available evidence necessary for an \r\nequitable disposition of the appellant's appeal has been \r\nobtained by the agency of original jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n2.  The appellant had active service in the Republic of \r\nVietnam during the Vietnam era.\r\n\r\n3.  The appellant did not engage in combat with the enemy \r\nduring his active military service.\r\n\r\n4.  The medical evidence reflects a diagnosis of PTSD, but \r\nthere is no credible supporting evidence to verify or \r\ncorroborate the appellant's alleged stressors during his \r\nactive military service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe appellant's PTSD was not incurred during service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1154, 5102, 5103, 5103A, and 5107 (West \r\n1991 & Supp. 2001); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, and 3.304(d) \r\nand (f) (1998) (as amended, 64 Fed. Reg. 32807-32808 (June \r\n18, 1999)); 66 Fed. Reg. 45,620 (Aug. 29, 2001) (to be \r\ncodified as amended at 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102 and 3.159).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAfter a thorough review of the evidence of record, the Board \r\nfinds that entitlement to service connection for PTSD has not \r\nbeen established.  \r\n\r\nI.  Service connection for PTSD\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for disability \r\nresulting from personal injury or disease incurred in or \r\naggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131.  In the \r\nabsence of chronicity at onset, a grant of service connection \r\nrequires evidence of continuity of symptomatology \r\ndemonstrating that a current disability was incurred in \r\nservice.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b).  Regulations also provide \r\nthat service connection may be established where all the \r\nevidence of record, including that pertinent to service, \r\ndemonstrates that the veteran's current disability was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\nestablishing a clear diagnosis of the condition, credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor \r\nactually occurred, and a link, established by medical \r\nevidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed in-\r\nservice stressor.  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  \r\nThe Board notes that the diagnostic criteria, including those \r\nrelated to stressors, set forth in THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC \r\nASSOCIATION: DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL \r\nDISORDERS, (4th ed. 1994) (DSM-IV) for mental disorders have \r\nbeen adopted by the VA during the pendency of this appeal.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 4.125.  \r\n\r\nAccording to the updated criteria, a diagnosis of PTSD \r\nrequires exposure to a traumatic event and a response \r\ninvolving intense fear, helplessness, or horror.  The \r\nappellant's claim must therefore be reviewed under the new \r\nregulatory provisions, as well as those in effect when he \r\nfiled his claim.  See Karnas v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 308 \r\n(1991).  In that regard, it is also noted that while this \r\ncase was undergoing development, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f) were amended.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2000).  \r\nAlso, while this case was pending, the General Counsel of the \r\nVA promulgated a Precedent Opinion defining when a veteran \r\nhad \"Engaged in Combat with the Enemy.\"  See VAOPGCPREC 12-\r\n99 (1999).\r\n\r\nA stressor involves exposure to a traumatic event in which \r\nthe person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an \r\nevent or events that involved actual or threatened death or \r\nserious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self \r\nor others and the person's response involved intense fear, \r\nhelplessness, or horror.  See Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. \r\n128 (1997).  The sufficiency of a stressor is a medical \r\ndetermination and is presumed by a medical diagnosis of PTSD.  \r\nId. The occurrence of a stressor is an adjudicatory \r\ndetermination.  \r\n\r\nIf the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to \r\nthat combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence \r\nto the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is \r\nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone \r\nmay establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service \r\nstressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (2000).  \r\n\r\nThe holding in Gaines v. West, 11 Vet. App. 353 (1998), a \r\ncase that supplemented the Cohen case, extends the current \r\nstandard for adjudication of claims such as the appellant's \r\non the merits by requiring that consideration be given to the \r\nreported participation in designated campaigns in the \r\ndetermination of whether the veteran engaged in combat with \r\nthe enemy, in addition to an analysis of sworn testimony \r\nrecalling combat events, the application of 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 1154(b) regarding the need for corroboration, and a \r\ndiscussion of the application of the-benefit-of-the-doubt \r\nrule.  See Gaines, 11 Vet. App. at 358-60.\r\n\r\nThe appellant's military personnel records show that he \r\nserved in the Marines in Vietnam from December 6, 1969 to \r\nJuly 29, 1970.  He was attached to the HQ Company, HQ \r\nBattalion (Rein), 1st Marine Division (Rein) Fleet Marine \r\nForce.  His service personnel records indicate that his \r\nMilitary Occupational Specialty (MOS) while he was with the \r\n1st Marine Division was 0161, postal clerk, division postal.  \r\nHe received the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam \r\nService Medal with one bronze service star, the Vietnam \r\nCampaign Medal with device and the Vietnam MUC Gallantry \r\nCross with Palm.  It was indicated that the appellant \r\nparticipated in operations against the Viet Cong in Vietnam \r\nfrom the first day to the last day of his tour there, but no \r\nnamed campaign is listed.\r\n\r\nIn August 1992, the appellant submitted a written statement \r\nin which he described a helicopter incident in which several \r\nMarines were killed, landing at various landing zones to \r\ndeliver mail and coming under fire, and an incident where his \r\njeep hit a land mine.\r\n\r\nIn February 1993, the appellant submitted a written statement \r\nin which he said he had participated in many dangerous \r\nmissions as a mail carrier.  He said that he was always under \r\nfire when flying out and back on a daily basis in a \r\nhelicopter.  He again described the helicopter incident where \r\na number of Marines were killed by falling.  The appellant \r\nalso described his duties as a field postal clerk delivering \r\nmail by truck and said he was almost blown up by a land mine \r\nonce.  \r\n\r\nIn March 1993, the appellant submitted another written \r\nstatement in which he said that he had to fly over enemy \r\nterritory to deliver the mail and that his helicopter was hit \r\nby hostile fire on several trips.  He again described the \r\nhelicopter incident where a friend and six other Marines were \r\nkilled.  He said that he would have to perform guard duty and \r\nthat there were always mortar attacks.  He gave two dates for \r\nthe land mine incident, 6/30/70 and 6/26/69.  He also stated \r\nthat he would come under enemy fire when he was with field \r\nunits.\r\n\r\nThe appellant provided details concerning his tour of duty in \r\nVietnam when he testified at a personal hearing held at the \r\nRO in May 1993.  He testified that he was initially stationed \r\nat the main post office in Da Nang to which all the mail \r\ncame, was sorted and then picked up by the \"outs\" unit.  He \r\nsaid that he was also stationed at three other units, with \r\ntwo of them being within five miles of the main post office.  \r\nHe also said that his primary duty was always as a mail clerk \r\nand that he did not participate in any particular operations \r\nas a rifleman.  See Hearing Transcript pp. 2-3.  The \r\nappellant testified that he flew in helicopters in the course \r\nof picking up and delivering the mail and that, while often \r\nunder various types of fire, he was never shot down.  He said \r\nthat sometimes he would be left at a firebase overnight and \r\nthat there would be attacks during the night with mortars, \r\nrockets and ground assaults.  He said that he would be placed \r\non standby duty during attacks and that he never performed \r\nperimeter guard duty.  See Hearing Transcript pp. 3-8.  He \r\ndescribed an incident where a jeep he was riding in was \r\nalmost blown up by a land mine.  See Hearing Transcript p. 9-\r\n11.  The appellant testified that he also delivered the mail \r\nby truck and that the trucks would come under fire.  See \r\nHearing Transcript pp. 11-13 and 17-20.  The appellant also \r\ndescribed an incident with the 5th Marine where a squad of \r\nMarines was killed in a helicopter incident in which they \r\nfell from netting trying to get into the helicopter near \r\ntreetop level.  See Hearing Transcript pp. 14-15. \r\n\r\nIn a written statement submitted to the RO in October 1995, \r\nthe appellant again described the fatal helicopter incident \r\nand the land mine incident.  The next month, the appellant \r\nsubmitted another written statement in response to RO \r\ninquiries and stated that it was impossible for him to \r\nspecifically identify names and places.\r\n\r\nThe appellant described a number of stressors in his \r\nresponses to a PTSD questionnaire submitted in February 1998.  \r\nHe stated that, besides acting as a postal clerk, he also \r\nacted as a mobile mail carrier who rode in helicopters to \r\ndeliver the mail to line units.  He also said that these \r\nhelicopters came under fire and that he came under fire when \r\nhe was on the ground handing out the mail bags at various \r\nlanding zones (Camp Carroll, LZ Baldy, LZ Ross, Quang Tri and \r\nChu Lai).  The appellant gave the name of a friend who he \r\nsaid was killed in Vietnam while he was there himself.\r\n\r\nThe appellant provided additional information in a written \r\nstatement submitted in July 1998.  He said that he was a \r\nmobile unit postal clerk and a land mobile unit clerk.  He \r\nsaid that he would get shot at going into the bases to \r\ndeliver and pick up mail and coming back afterwards.  The \r\nappellant stated that he would have to drive down roads with \r\nlandmines to pick up and deliver the mail and that he had a \r\nmine blow up on him.  He said that he was assigned to the \r\nengineering company and the trucking company of the 26th \r\nMarine.\r\n\r\nIn June 1995, the Board remanded the case for additional \r\ndevelopment of the evidence, to include a request to the \r\nappellant for a comprehensive statement regarding the details \r\nof his alleged stressor during service.  In July 1996, the RO \r\nrequested the appellant to furnish a detailed statement of \r\nthe claimed stressful events during service, to include \r\ndates, places, detailed descriptions of events and \r\nidentifying information concerning any other individuals \r\ninvolved in the events, including their names and unit of \r\nassignment.\r\n\r\nIn May 1998, and using the information provided by the \r\nappellant, the RO requested verification from the Marine \r\nCorps of the reported stressors and attached a copy of the \r\nappellant's DD Form 214, along with copies of his service \r\npersonnel records and his written statements describing the \r\nstressors.  In response to the RO request for verification of \r\nthe reported stressors, the Personnel Management Support \r\nBranch (PMSB) of the Marine Corps advised the RO in that same \r\nmonth that the information provided by the appellant was \r\ninsufficient to conduct any meaningful research.  It was \r\nindicated that a stress incident described in detail, one \r\nrelating the who, what, when, and where, would very likely be \r\nwithin their capability to verify through unit records.  It \r\nwas noted that date spans of less than seven days are \r\npreferred due to the large volume and variety of records \r\nnormally available.  It was indicated that the individual \r\nnamed by the appellant as having been killed could not be \r\nidentified and the name did not appear in the directory of \r\nnames of individuals listed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.  \r\nA similar letter was sent to the RO in September 1998, \r\ninforming the RO that they had no listing for a 26th Combat \r\nEngineer Battalion or a truck company for the 26th Marines.  \r\n\r\nIn attempting to verify the appellant's stressors, the RO \r\nalso contacted the U.S. Armed Services Center for Research of \r\nUnit Records (USASCRUR) (formerly known as the U.S. Army and \r\nJoint Services Environmental Support Group (ESG)).  In August \r\n1998, USASCRUR responded and informed the RO that it had \r\n\"discontinued all PTSD research on behalf of U.S. Marine \r\nCorps (USMC) veterans.\"  The USASCRUR notified the RO that \r\nits request had been directed to the proper unit of the USMC. \r\n\r\nPursuant to the August 2000 Board remand, the RO again \r\ncontacted the Marines and this time received the command \r\nchronologies for the HQ Company, HQ Battalion, 1st Marine \r\nDivision, for the period from December 1969 through July \r\n1970.  Review of those records did not provide any \r\ncorroborating information concerning the appellant's \r\ndescribed stressors.\r\n\r\nThe appellant alleges that he engaged in combat with the \r\nenemy during service while delivering and collecting mail at \r\nfront line landing bases.  A determination as to whether the \r\nappellant is a veteran of combat is particularly significant \r\nin a PTSD claim because he is entitled to have his lay \r\nstatements as to his alleged stressors accepted, without \r\ncorroboration, if he engaged in combat with the enemy.  See \r\nGaines v. West, 11 Vet. App. 353 (1998).  The Court has held \r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\"[w]here it is determined, through recognized military \r\ncitations or other supportive evidence, that the veteran was \r\nengaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressors \r\nare related to such combat, the veteran's lay testimony \r\nregarding claimed stressors must be accepted as conclusive as \r\nto their actual occurrence and no further development for \r\ncorroborative evidence will be required, provided that the \r\nveteran's testimony is found to be 'satisfactory,' e.g., \r\ncredible, and 'consistent with the circumstances, conditions, \r\nor hardships of [combat] service.'\"\r\n\r\nZarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 (1993); see also \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d) (1998) (as \r\namended, 64 Fed. Reg. 32807-32808, June 18, 1999)).  Before \r\nthis provision applies, the Board must make a specific \r\nfinding that the appellant was engaged in combat with the \r\nenemy.  See Zarycki.  Whether or not a veteran \"engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy\" must be determined through recognized \r\nmilitary citations or other supportive evidence.  In other \r\nwords, the claimant's assertions that he \"engaged in combat \r\nwith the enemy\" are not sufficient, by themselves, to \r\nestablish this fact.\r\n\r\nVA's General Counsel has defined the phrase \"engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy\" to mean that the veteran must have \r\npersonally participated in a fight or encounter with a \r\nmilitary foe or hostile unit or instrumentality.  VAOPGCPREC \r\n12-99.  The fact that the veteran served in a \"combat area\" \r\nor \"combat zone\" does not mean that he himself engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy.  Id.  Moreover, a general statement in \r\nthe veteran's service personnel records that he participated \r\nin a particular operation or campaign would not, in itself, \r\nestablish that he engaged in combat with the enemy because \r\nthe terms \"operation\" and \"campaign\" encompass both combat \r\nand non-combat activities.  Id.  Whether or not a veteran \r\n\"engaged in combat with the enemy\" must be determined through \r\nrecognized military citations or other supportive evidence.  \r\nNo single item of evidence is determinative, and VA must \r\nassess the credibility, probative value, and relative weight \r\nof each relevant item of evidence.  Id.  The claimant's \r\nassertions that he engaged in combat with the enemy are not \r\nignored, but are evaluated along with the other evidence of \r\nrecord.  Id.  \r\n\r\nIn other words, the claimant's assertions that he \"engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy\" are not sufficient, by themselves, to \r\nestablish this fact.  In determining whether or not the \r\nveteran was engaged in combat with the enemy, the Board notes \r\nthat the provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) were changed in \r\n2000 as a result of the Cohen decision.  Formerly, it \r\nprovided that if the claimed stressor was related to combat, \r\nservice department evidence that the veteran engaged in \r\ncombat or was awarded the Purple Heart, Combat Infantry \r\nBadge, or similar citation would be accepted, in the absence \r\nof evidence to the contrary, as conclusive evidence of the \r\nclaimed inservice stressor.  In Cohen, the Court noted that \r\nthe corroborating evidence no longer was restricted to \r\nservice department records.  However, there is no restriction \r\nprecluding the Board from using the absence of service \r\ndepartment records as a factor for determination.  Cohen, 10 \r\nVet. App. at 142-143.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, the appellant's military personnel records \r\nreflect that he was awarded the National Defense Service \r\nMedal, the Vietnam Service Medal with one bronze service \r\nstar, the Vietnam Campaign Medal with device and the Vietnam \r\nMUC Gallantry Cross with Palm.  A National Defense Service \r\nMedal was awarded if a veteran served honorably between \r\nJanuary 1, 1961, and August 14, 1974.  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \r\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MANUAL OF MILITARY DECORATIONS AND AWARDS, Appendix \r\nD at D-23, September 1996.  A Vietnam Service Medal was \r\nawarded if a veteran served between July 4, 1965 and March \r\n28, 1973, in Vietnam.  Id. at D-27.  A Republic of Vietnam \r\nCampaign Medal was awarded to all service personnel within \r\nthe cited theater, and it does not rule in, or rule out, \r\ncombat.  Id. at 7-7.  These awards do not reflect that the \r\nappellant himself was involved in active combat.  The \r\nRepublic of Vietnam awarded the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry to \r\nunits, not to individual soldiers.  It is not dispositive in \r\nthis case, as by itself it does not conclusively show that \r\nthe appellant was individually active in combat.  Since the \r\nremainder of the appellant's service personnel records are \r\nnegative for any information verifying that he took part in \r\ncombat, these awards are at most probative of unit, not \r\nindividual participation in combat.  The Board notes that the \r\nappellant has not asserted that he was awarded the Combat \r\nAction Ribbon, which would indicate that he was involved in \r\ncombat.\r\n\r\nIn this case, for the following reasons, the Board finds that \r\nthe appellant did not engage in combat with the enemy.  \r\nFirst, his military occupational specialty of postal clerk \r\nwhile in Vietnam does not indicate combat service.  Although \r\nit is possible that he engaged in combat with the enemy, none \r\nof the unit records obtained pursuant to development actions \r\nin this case reveal the incidents he described.  There is no \r\nsupport in his military records for his allegation that he \r\nwas involved in any combat activity.  Second, none of the \r\nappellant's awarded medals or decorations showed active \r\ncombat involvement.  Some of his awards do not specifically \r\nrule in, or, for that matter, rule out, participation in \r\ncombat with the enemy.  However, when they are considered in \r\nconjunction with his location and military occupational \r\nspecialty during the relevant time period, there is no \r\nlikelihood that one of these awards was actually awarded for \r\ncombat.\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the evidence of record is against \r\nfinding that the appellant engaged in combat with the enemy, \r\nand there is no reasonable doubt on this issue that could be \r\nresolved in his favor.  A reasonable doubt exists where there \r\nis an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence \r\nthat does not satisfactorily prove or disprove the claim.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.102.  It is a substantial doubt and one within \r\nthe range of probability as distinguished from pure \r\nspeculation or remote possibility.  Id.  It is not a means of \r\nreconciling actual conflict or a contradiction in the \r\nevidence.  Id.  In this case, for the reasons and bases \r\ndiscussed above, a reasonable doubt does not exist as to \r\nwhether he engaged in combat with the enemy in Vietnam.  \r\nTherefore, although the evidence shows that the appellant \r\nserved overseas in Vietnam during the Vietnam era, the \r\nevidence does not support the conclusion that he engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy, and the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 1154(b) do not apply.\r\n\r\nSince the Board finds that the appellant did not engage in \r\ncombat with the enemy, there must be credible supporting \r\nevidence of record that the alleged stressors actually \r\noccurred in order to warrant service connection.  \"Credible \r\nsupporting evidence\" of a noncombat stressor may be obtained \r\nfrom service records or other sources.  Moreau v. Brown, 9 \r\nVet. App. 389 (1996).  However, the Court has held that the \r\nregulatory requirement for \"credible supporting evidence\" \r\nmeans that \"the appellant's testimony, by itself, cannot, as \r\na matter of law, establish the occurrence of a noncombat \r\nstressor.\"  Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163 (1996).  His \r\nlay testimony is insufficient, standing alone, to establish \r\nservice connection.  Cohen, 10 Vet. App. at 147 (citing \r\nMoreau, 9 Vet. App. at 395).  \r\n\r\nIn this case, other than the appellant's own statements \r\nconcerning the alleged stressors described in the record, \r\nthere is no competent evidence regarding the claimed \r\ninservice stressors in the claims file.  Despite repeat \r\nsearches by the Headquarters of the USMC, corroborating \r\nevidence relating to the stressors described over and over by \r\nthe appellant in his hearing testimony and in his written \r\nstatements has not been uncovered.  It appears that this may \r\nbe due to a lack of specific details about those stressors \r\nfrom the appellant that would provide a tangible avenue for \r\nthe USMC to research.  Accordingly, there is no credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed stressors actually \r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Board concludes that the appellant's \r\nassertions alone are of insufficient probative value to meet \r\nthe second element required to establish service connection \r\nfor PTSD, credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-\r\nservice stressors actually occurred.  In view of the \r\nforegoing, the Board concludes that, while a diagnosis of \r\nPTSD is established by the medical evidence, a preponderance \r\nof the evidence is against this claim on the basis that \r\nverification of the alleged stressors has not been satisfied, \r\nfor the reasons detailed above.  \r\n\r\nThe Board is cognizant of the appellant's own statements to \r\nthe effect that he experiences symptoms of PTSD that are due \r\nto stressors while in service.  However, the evidence does \r\nnot indicate that he possesses medical expertise.  He is not \r\ncompetent to render an opinion on a matter involving medical \r\nknowledge, such as diagnosis or causation.  See Edenfield v. \r\nBrown, 8 Vet. App. 384, 388 (1995); Robinette v. Brown, 8 \r\nVet. App. 69, 74 (1995); Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, \r\n93 (1993); Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 494 \r\n(1992).\r\n\r\nAfter a thorough review of the evidence of record, the Board \r\nfinds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the \r\nappellant's claim for service connection for PTSD.  Although \r\ndiagnoses of PTSD are of record, there is no evidence of \r\nrecord corroborating that the alleged inservice stressors \r\nactually occurred, and there are no specific details of \r\nrecord indicating that any of the alleged stressors could be \r\nverified by competent evidence.  \r\n\r\nSince the preponderance of the evidence is this claim, the \r\nbenefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply.  Schoolman v. \r\nWest, 12 Vet. App. 307, 311 (1999).  Accordingly, service \r\nconnection for PTSD is not warranted.\r\n\r\nII.  Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000\r\n\r\nThe Board is aware that, in November 2000, the President \r\nsigned into law the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, \r\nPub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000) (VCAA).  Among \r\nother things, this law includes an enhanced duty to notify a \r\nclaimant as to the information and evidence necessary to \r\nsubstantiate a claim for VA benefits.  With few exceptions, \r\nthis law is applicable to all claims filed on or after the \r\ndate of enactment, or filed before the date of enactment and \r\nnot yet final as of that date.  \r\n\r\nBecause of the change in the law brought about by the VCAA, \r\ncompliance with the notice and duty to assist provisions in \r\nthe new law is required.  The RO has not had an opportunity \r\nto consider this new legislation with regard to the \r\nappellant's claims.  However, the Board has carefully \r\nconsidered the record, particularly in light of the \r\nprovisions of the VCAA, and finds that the appellant has been \r\nfully assisted in the development of his claim.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the VCAA essentially provides that VA has \r\na duty to notify the appellant and his representative of any \r\ninformation and evidence needed to substantiate and complete \r\na claim.  The Board finds that the VA has met its duty to \r\nadvise and notify the appellant in this case.  The appellant \r\nwas advised and notified of the evidence necessary to \r\nestablish service connection for PTSD in the March 1993 \r\nStatement of the Case and the several Supplemental Statements \r\nof the Case.  The Board finds that the discussions in the \r\nrating decisions, the Statement of the Case, the Supplemental \r\nStatements of the Case and the Board remands sent to the \r\nappellant in effect informed him of the information and \r\nevidence that would be needed to substantiate his PTSD claim \r\nand complied with VA's notification requirements.  See \r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-475, \r\n�� 3-4, 114 Stat. 2096, 2096-2099 (2000) (codified as amended \r\nat 38 U.S.C. �� 5100 et seq. (West Supp. 2001)); 66 Fed. Reg. \r\n45620 (August 29, 2001) (to be codified as amended at \r\n38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159 and 3.326(a)).\r\n\r\nThe record reflects that in August 1992, February 1993, March \r\n1993, October 1995, November 1995, January 1996 and July \r\n1998, the appellant provided information concerning his \r\nalleged stressors.  He also provided information about his \r\nstressors in a personal hearing conducted at the RO in May \r\n1993.  While the appellant's testimony and written statement \r\ndid provide some information about the reported stressors and \r\nnamed one individual who died in Vietnam, it did not provide \r\nspecific dates or places of the incidents claimed which was \r\nessential for verification purposes.  Pursuant to the Board's \r\nJune 1995 Remand instructions, the RO, in May 1998, requested \r\nverification of the reported stressors from the Marine Corps \r\nand from the United States Armed Services Center for Research \r\nof Unit Records (USASCRUR) (formerly the U.S. Army and Joint \r\nServices Environmental Support Group (ESG)) with negative \r\nresults.  The RO submitted additional information to the \r\nMarine Corps in August 1998, but again received a negative \r\nreply.  Pursuant to the August 2000 Board remand, the RO \r\nagain contacted the Marines and this time received the \r\ncommand chronologies for the HQ Company, HQ Battalion, 1st \r\nMarine Division, for the period from December 1969 through \r\nJuly 1970.  The RO also obtained the appellant's VA treatment \r\nrecords dated between February 1994 and September 2001.\r\n\r\nThe appellant and his representative have been given ample \r\nopportunity to submit specific information concerning the \r\nclaimed stressors that would assist VA in the corroboration \r\nprocess.  The appellant has been advised that he must provide \r\nthe \"who, what, when and where\" for each of the claimed \r\nstressors in order for those events to be verified.  He has \r\nsubmitted written statements and testimony in which he \r\ndescribed his stressors.  He has not provided enough specific \r\ninformation as to the dates and places of the events and \r\nthose events could not be verified.  The death of his friend \r\ncould not be confirmed.  As the appellant has been unable to \r\nprovide the requisite information needed by VA in order to \r\nattempt to verify the additional claimed stressors, \r\nadditional attempts at verification are not warranted.\r\n\r\nWhile the RO attempted to obtain the appellant's Army \r\npersonnel file (the '201' file or the DA Form 20), the \r\nNational Personnel Records Center (NPRC) informed the RO, in \r\nDecember 1997, that it was unable to locate these records.  \r\nHowever, since none of the appellant's reported stressors \r\noccurred during his time of active service in the Army, he is \r\nnot prejudiced by the absence of his Army personnel records \r\nfrom the claims file.\r\n\r\nThe record does not reflect, and the appellant does not \r\nallege, that there exists any additional missing evidence \r\nthat would provide corroboration to his claimed stressors \r\nthat may be under private or government control.  Indeed, the \r\nappellant has reported that he is unable to specifically \r\nrecall any further details relative to his claimed stressors \r\nthat may be used in an attempt to research his accounts.  As \r\na result, it is manifestly impossible to perform any further \r\nmeaningful research in order to verify the appellant's \r\nclaimed stressors.  See Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 68 \r\n(1993); Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991) \r\n[observing that the duty to assist is not unilateral on the \r\npart of VA, and emphasizing the appellant must lend \r\nassistance to provide necessary information that is essential \r\nin obtaining the putative evidence].\r\n\r\nIn short, the Board finds that VA's statutory duty to inform \r\nand assist the appellant in the development of his claim has \r\nbeen satisfied under the circumstances presented in this \r\ncase.  The appellant has been specifically notified \r\nconcerning what type of evidence is necessary with respect to \r\nhis PTSD claim, and he has neither furnished such evidence \r\nnor has he provided VA with information that would enable the \r\ngovernment to identify and procure this information.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board is satisfied that all \r\nrelevant facts with respect to this claim have been properly \r\ndeveloped and that no further assistance to the appellant is \r\nrequired.  There is no indication that, based on the details \r\nprovided to date by the appellant, additional relevant \r\navailable records exist that would corroborate the \r\nappellant's described stressors.  Thus, the Board concludes \r\nthat the evidence is sufficient for reaching a fair and well-\r\nreasoned decision with respect to the PTSD claim on appeal, \r\nand that the duty to assist appellant has been satisfied.  \r\nSee Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub.

Mainelli, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from December 1964 to December \r\n1968.\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from a May 1996 rating decision by the Huntington, \r\nWest Virginia Regional Office (RO) of the Department of \r\nVeterans Affairs (VA) which denied service connection for \r\nPTSD.  In November 1999, the Board remanded the claim to the \r\nRO for additional development.  The case has now been \r\nreturned to the Board for completion of appellate \r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The veteran was not engaged in combat in service, and his \r\nallegations of exposure to combat and non-combat stressors \r\nare not credible.\r\n\r\n2.  The veteran's PTSD is not shown to have its origins in \r\nhis military service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated during service.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 1991); 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107 (West Supp. \r\n2001); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1996-2001).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nInitially, the Board notes that there has been a significant \r\nchange in the law during the pendency of this appeal.  On \r\nNovember 9, 2000, the President signed into law the Veterans \r\nClaims Assistance Act (VCAA) of 2000.  In pertinent part, \r\nthis law redefined VA's notice and duty to assist \r\nrequirements.  See 38 U.S.C. �� 5102, 5103, 5103A, and 5107 \r\n(West Supp. 2001).  The RO has enacted regulations to \r\nimplement the provisions of the VCAA.  66 Fed. Reg. 45620-\r\n45632 (Aug. 29, 2001).  These changes in law are potentially \r\napplicable to the claim on appeal.  See  Karnas v. Derwinski, \r\n1 Vet. App. 308 (1991).\r\n\r\nUpon review of the record, the Board finds that VA has met \r\nthe duty to assist and notice requirements under the VCAA.  \r\nBy virtue of a Statement of the Case (SOC) and multiple \r\nSupplemental Statements of the Case (SSOC), the veteran has \r\nbeen advised of the Reasons and Bases in denying his claim.  \r\nAs addressed below, the dispositive issue in this case \r\nconcerns whether the veteran was exposed to combat and non-\r\ncombat stressors during his period of service in the Republic \r\nof Vietnam.  On this issue, the veteran has been provided \r\nample notice and opportunity to present detailed descriptions \r\nregarding the time, place and circumstances of his claimed \r\nin-service stressors.  \r\n\r\nIn this case, the RO has undertaken extensive efforts to \r\nverify the veteran's claimed stressors by requesting research \r\nfrom the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), \r\nthe U.S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records \r\n(USASCRUR), the Navy Historical Center, the Department of the \r\nNavy and the Chief of Naval Operations.  This effort has \r\nresulted in the acquisition of the Deck Logs of the USS CORAL \r\nSEA CVA-43 for the time period from January 1966 to August \r\n1966, review of the Vietnam Casualty cards and analysis of \r\nthe historical records by these agencies.  On several \r\noccasions, the RO has been advised that deck logs for the \r\ntime period prior to January 1966 are not available.  This \r\nrecord was sought to verify the veteran's claim of witnessing \r\na soldier killed by walking into an airplane propeller in \r\n1965.  The RO has associated with the claims folder \r\ninformation from website of the Navy Historical Center which \r\nshows that NARA is the custodian of the 1965 deck logs.  In a \r\nletter dated in July 2000, NARA advised the RO that these \r\nrecords had been missing since October 1998.  The RO advised \r\nthe veteran of the unavailability of records in a March 2002 \r\nSSOC.  As addressed below, the Board finds that the \r\nunavailability of the 1965 deck logs is largely irrelevant as \r\nthe version of this non-combat stressor relied upon by the VA \r\nexaminers in arriving at the veteran's PTSD diagnosis clearly \r\ndid not happen.\r\n\r\nBased upon the above, the Board finds that no reasonable \r\npossibility exists that any further assistance would aid the \r\nveteran in substantiating his claim.  In this respect, the RO \r\nhas accomplished all development necessary to substantiate \r\nthe claim, and the veteran has been provided proper notice \r\nand opportunity to submit the evidence needed to substantiate \r\nhis claim.  Thus, the Board finds that no prejudice accrues \r\nto the veteran in proceeding to the merits of his claim at \r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for disability \r\nresulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted \r\nin the line of duty during a period of active wartime and \r\npeacetime service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131 (West 1991).  \r\nThe claimant bears the burden to present and support a claim \r\nof benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a) (West Supp. 2001).  In \r\nevaluating service connection claims, the Board shall \r\nconsider all information and lay and medical evidence of \r\nrecord.  When there is an approximate balance of positive and \r\nnegative evidence regarding any issue material to the \r\ndetermination of a matter, the Board shall give the benefit \r\nof the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b) (West \r\nSupp. 2001).\r\n\r\nApplicable regulatory criteria provide that service \r\nconnection for PTSD requires medical evidence of a PTSD \r\ndiagnosis which conforms to the Diagnostic and Statistical \r\nManual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., 1994 (DSM-IV), see \r\n38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) (2001), a medical link between current \r\nsymptoms and in-service stressor(s) and credible supporting \r\nevidence that the claimed in-service stressor(s) occurred.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2001); Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. \r\n128, 138 (1997).  In this case, the veteran has presented VA \r\ndiagnoses of PTSD which appear to conform to DSM-IV.  See \r\n38 C.F.R. �� 3.304(f); 4.125(a) (2001).  The issue presented \r\nin this case concerns whether the veteran was actually \r\nexposed to the combat and non-combat stressors relied upon by \r\nVA examiners in arriving at his PTSD diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that his PTSD stems from his exposure to \r\ncombat and non-combat stressors during his period of service \r\nin the Republic of Vietnam.  A March 1995 VA mental health \r\nclinic record first documents his report of stressors as \r\nfollows:  \r\n\r\nThe veteran reports he was in Vietnam from May \r\nof 1965 to October o[r] November of 1965, came \r\nback to the states for six months, and again \r\nwent to Vietnam in June of 1966 and left in \r\nOctober or November of 1966.  The veteran \r\nreports that he worked on a ship to go in the \r\ncountry and frequently ran into combat.  The \r\npatient reported one incident while off the \r\nship in which they were ambushed and only he \r\nand one Marine survived.  The veteran reports \r\nthat he believes 11 or 12 people were killed.\r\n\r\nOn VA PTSD examination in October 1995, the veteran reported \r\nhis stressors as follows:\r\n\r\nThe client indicated that he worked as an 'air \r\nops.'  He indicated that while working in the \r\ncapacity of air operations, he witnessed a \r\nperson walk through rotating propellers.  \r\n'This man was not recognizable.'  The client \r\nstated that on one occasion, he was on duty \r\nand his vessel came extremely close to the \r\nshore of China.  His vessel was operating with \r\nanother vessel named U.S.S. Midway.  During \r\nthis event, an A-3, per his report, crashed on \r\nthe deck, and it was 'non-recoverable.'  At \r\nthat same time, 'the Midway's catapults were \r\nout.'  The client also stated that the \r\ncommunications center was not working on \r\neither vessel.  'We made steam for 14 hours \r\nback to Yankee Station.  We saw MIG's fly out \r\nat us, but did not engage us.  In addition, \r\nthey sent torpedo boats towards us.  We were \r\ncompletely defenseless.  This was an extremely \r\nnerve-wracking experience.\"  On one other \r\noccasion, the client ordered a C-1 cargo \r\nplane, which was used by the air ops, to \r\nsalvage 'secret mechanical parts of downed \r\naircraft.'  He made three such trips.  On \r\nthese occasions, he had to 'dig out for the \r\nparts.'  By this, the client indicated that he \r\nmeant he had to salvage through the plane to \r\nfind instrumentation.  On his third such trip, \r\nhe was taken from Da Nang by truck to a \r\nrendezvous point and he met up with a squad of \r\nMarines, which served as security for them.  \r\nHe indicated that they walked by foot to find \r\nthe plane that had been shot down.  'We got \r\nambushed, and a lot of people were killed.  My \r\nshipmate was also killed.'  The client also \r\nstated that he was armed with an '870 \r\nshotgun.'  The client and the Marines defended \r\nthemselves, and during this action the client \r\nand a Lance Corporal became separated from \r\nthis Unit.  He stated that he was in the \r\njungle for approximately two days.  During \r\nthis time, he and the Marine worked their way \r\nback towards known territory.  At the end of \r\nthe second day, they found a Marine patrol.\r\n\r\nDuring his appearance before the RO in January 1997, the \r\nveteran testified that the USS CORAL SEA was an aircraft \r\ncarrier, and that his duties in the AirOps division primarily \r\nconsisted of air traffic control.  He clarified that he did \r\nnot actually witness a sailor being hit with a propeller.  \r\nRather, he witnessed a sailor being carried in front of him \r\non stretcher on his way to sick bay after being injured.  He \r\ndescribed the physical condition of the sailor as \"kind of \r\nmessed up.\"  This event occurred in approximately June or \r\nJuly of 1965.  He also testified that the ambush incident \r\noccurred in approximately August 1966.  He was accompanied by \r\nAir Traffic Controller, 2nd Class Purcell on a volunteer \r\nmission to recover parts from a downed aircraft.  They were \r\nflown by cargo plane to the mainland where they were joined \r\nby a protective detail of 10 Marines.  From there, they \r\nwalked to the crash site.  The airplane parts were not \r\nsalvageable, and they blew the plane up with a grenade.  \r\nSubsequently, they were ambushed by the enemy at which time \r\nthe veteran witnessed several people killed.  He believed \r\nthat Purcell was at least wounded.  He made his way back to \r\nfriendly territory with Lance Corporal Jones and, eventually, \r\nwas flown back to the USS CORAL SEA.  He assumed that Purcell \r\nwas killed as he never returned to the ship.  He further \r\ntestified that his hostile pay aboard the USS CORAL SEA \r\npertained to duty \"on the line\" and was not awarded for his \r\nparticipation in actual combat.\r\n\r\nOn VA PTSD examination in June 1998, the veteran reported \r\nthat his most stressful event in service was when he \"saw a \r\nperson get killed by a propeller ... aboard the U.S.S. naval \r\nship.\"  He also reported participating in three salvage \r\noperations in Vietnam.  On his third trip, he witnessed some \r\nMarines from a protective unit get killed in an ambush.\r\n\r\nService records or \"other supportive evidence\" may \r\nestablish combat status.  See West v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 70, \r\n76 (1994).  Service department evidence that the veteran was \r\nengaged in combat or that the veteran was awarded the Purple \r\nHeart, Combat Infantryman Badge, or similar citation will be \r\naccepted, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as \r\nconclusive evidence of the claimed inservice stressor.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1996-1998).  A substantive revision to \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), which occurred during the appeal \r\nperiod, relaxed the evidentiary standard governing the \r\ntype(s) of evidence required to establish service connection \r\nfor PTSD.  See 64 Fed. Reg. 32807-32808 (June 18, 1999).  In \r\npertinent part, the new provision holds that a claimant's \r\ntestimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed \r\nin-service stressor if consistent with the circumstances, \r\nconditions, or hardships of his/her service.  However, this \r\nprovision is only applicable once a claimant has established \r\nthat he/she engaged in combat with the enemy.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f) (2001).\r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (known \r\nas the United States Court of Veterans Appeals prior to March \r\n1, 1999) (Court) has made it clear that, where a claimed \r\nstressor is alleged to have occurred during combat, VA must \r\nmake a specific finding as to whether or not the claimant was \r\ninvolved in combat.  Gaines v. West, 11 Vet. App. 353, 359 \r\n(1998).  VA is not required to accept a claimant's assertions \r\nof combat exposure but, in arriving at its findings of fact, \r\nthe credibility of the claimant's testimony and statements of \r\nrecord must be addressed.  Cohen, 10 Vet. App. at 145-46.\r\n\"Credible supporting evidence\" of a non-combat stressor may \r\nbe obtained from service records or other sources, to include \r\nlay testimony.  Gaines, 11 Vet. App. at 353; Moreau v. Brown, \r\n9 Vet. App. 389 (1996).  For instance, independent evidence \r\nsuch as radio logs and morning reports which establish the \r\noccurrence of a stressful event and implies a claimant's \r\npersonal exposure is sufficient to constitute credible \r\nsupporting evidence.  Suozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307 \r\n(1997).  However, the regulatory requirement for \"credible \r\nsupporting evidence\" means that a claimant's testimony, or \r\nthe medical opinion based upon post-service examination, \r\nalone cannot, as a matter of law, establish the occurrence of \r\na non-combat stressor.  Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163, \r\n166 (1996); Moreau, 9 Vet. App. at 396.  Examples of \"other \r\nsupportive evidence\" includes, but is not limited to, \r\nincidents of a plane crash, ship sinking, explosion, rape or \r\nassault, or duty in a burn ward or graves registration unit.  \r\nSee Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) Adjudication \r\nProcedure Manual M21-1 (M21-1), Part VI (1998).\r\n\r\nThe veteran's service medical records do not reflect his \r\nreport of exposure to combat or non-combat stressors.  He was \r\nprescribed Librium on one occasion in April 1965 for his \r\n\"nerves.\"  On August 8, 1965, he was treated for flu \r\nsyndrome aboard the USS CORAL SEA (CVA 43).  He returned for \r\nfollow-up treatment on August 19, 1965.  His personnel \r\nrecords reveal that he was assigned to duty aboard the USS \r\nCORAL SEA (CVA 43) from June 23, 1965 to October 6, 1966.  He \r\nwas assigned to AirOps where he served as a Status Board \r\nOperator, DRT Operator, Teletype Operator and Raspberry \r\nOperator.  In 1965, the members of the USS CORAL SEA (CVA 43) \r\nwere qualified for hostile fire pay for the periods of June \r\n26-30, July 1-23, August 13-31 and October 1-15.  He was \r\nawarded the Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon, National Defense \r\nService Medal and Vietnam Service Medal. \r\n\r\nResearch conducted by USASCRUR, which consisted of the \r\nhistory and deck log extracts of the USS CORAL SEA, confirms \r\nthat members aboard the CORAL SEA participated in special \r\noperations during the veteran's Vietnam tour.  These records \r\nalso verified that accidents occurred aboard ship.  However, \r\nUSASCRUR was unable to verify the incident of a sailor being \r\nhit by an aircraft propeller as the Federal Records Center \r\nwas unable to provide the 1965 deck logs.  USASCRUR was \r\nunable to confirm the veteran's report of being ambushed by \r\nthe Viet Cong in August 1966 as deck logs revealed no Vietnam \r\nservice during this time period.  The September and October \r\n1966 deck logs indicated that the CORAL SEA conducted special \r\noperations in Vietnam, but did not mention an ambush.  \r\nAdditionally, it was noted that the U.S. Navy Casualty \r\nAssistance Branch had no documentation of a casualty named \r\n\"Purcell.\"\r\n\r\nThe attached history of the USS CORAL SEA reveals that, \r\nduring the period of February to June 1965, she was involved \r\nin intense combat operations in Southeast Asia.  During this \r\ntime period, the pilots and crew handled over 10,000 sorties \r\nagainst military and logistic facilities in North Vietnam \r\n\"without serious incident.\"  The deck logs of the USS CORAL \r\nSEA for August 1966 reveal that, on July 19, 1966, she \r\ndeparted from home port of Alameda, California enroute to \r\nPearl Harbor, Hawaii and then to Yokosuka, Japan.  On August \r\n20, she departed Yokosuka enroute to Subic Bay, Philippines.  \r\nA planned departure from Subic Bay enroute to the Gulf of \r\nTonkin on August 26, 1966 was canceled due to damaged ship \r\nscrews.  The next day, she departed to Yokosuka for repairs \r\nand arrived on August 31, 1966.  On September 8, 1966, she \r\ndeparted Yokosuka enroute to the South China Sea and Yankee \r\nStation.  On September 13, 1966, she launched her first \r\nstrikes of the 1966-67 cruise on communist targets in North \r\nVietnam.  There is also no mention of crewmembers engaging in \r\nsalvage missions on mainland Vietnam.\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated in March 2000, the Head of the Ships \r\nHistory Branch of the Naval Historical Center provided \r\nopinion that the veteran's report of ambush while carrying \r\nout a salvage mission in Vietnam seemed \"unlikely.\"  In \r\nsupport of this conclusion, the Head of the Ships History \r\nBranch stated as follows:\r\n\r\nAccording to CORAL SEA's command history, she \r\nbegan a period of Vietnam service on 13 \r\nSeptember 1966 and ended it in January 1967.  \r\nThis service took place on Yankee Station in \r\nthe Tonkin Gulf, some miles off the coast of \r\nNorth Vietnam.  It seems improbable, to say the \r\nleast, that an aircraft carrier operating off \r\nenemy territory would send people ashore in \r\nthat hostile country to 'salvage parts from a \r\ndestroyed airplane.'\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated in April 2000, the Acting Head of the \r\nOperational Archives Branch of the Naval Historical Center \r\nreported that Vietnam casualty cards reported only one person \r\nnamed Purcell as a casualty during Vietnam.  This individual \r\nwas a lieutenant junior grade who was reported missing in \r\naction after his aircraft was lost in the Gulf of Thailand on \r\nApril 1, 1968.\r\n\r\nIn another letter dated in April 2000, NARA reported that a \r\nship's deck log constituted a brief record of the internal \r\nadministrative and mechanical workings of the ship.  When the \r\nship was underway, the log included information such as the \r\nship's location, course and speed; sea and weather \r\nconditions; information relating to the ship's machinery; and \r\nany unusual events.  When the ship was in port, a record was \r\nkept of arrivals and departures of individuals, other \r\nadministrative details and the ubiquitous notations on the \r\nfunctioning of the ship's machinery.  Normally, a deck log \r\ncontained little information regarding the mission in which \r\nthe ship was involved, and was not a detailed journal \r\ndescribing all the events which transpired in and around the \r\nship.\r\n\r\nIn January 2002, NARA provided the RO with the deck logs of \r\nthe USS CORAL SEA for the entire period during January to \r\nJuly 1966.  The August 1996 deck logs had previously been \r\nassociated with the claims folder.  These logs document the \r\nadministrative details pertaining to the 2000+ crew of the \r\nUSS CORAL SEA, to include the duty status of crewmembers that \r\nwere injured both on and off ship.  There is no report that \r\nan individual named Purcell was unavailable for duty due to \r\ninjury or death.  \r\n\r\nReview of the VA PTSD examinations in October 1995 and June \r\n1998 reveals that the veteran's diagnosis of PTSD was based, \r\nin part, on his report of witnessing the death of a sailor by \r\nwalking through airplane propellers.  In October 1995, he \r\nreported that he witnessed a person walk through rotating \r\npropellers and that the \"man was not recognizable.\"  In \r\nJune 1998, he reported that he \"saw [the] person get killed \r\nby a propeller.\"  The other stressor relied upon by the VA \r\nexaminers in arriving at the PTSD concerns the veteran's \r\nreport of being ambushed during an August 1966 salvage \r\nmission in Vietnam.  He alleged that approximately 10 Marines \r\nas well as a shipmate, later identified as Purcell, were \r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nThe facts in this case establish that the veteran was not \r\nawarded any decorations indicative of combat service.  His \r\npersonnel records and the history of the USS CORAL SEA \r\nestablish that his payment of hostile fire pay and award of \r\nthe Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon pertained to the service of \r\nthe USS CORAL SEA (CVA 43) in combat support operations in \r\n1965.  The veteran has denied any combat exposure during this \r\ntime period.  The deck logs of the USS CORAL SEA contradict \r\nhis report of combat exposure on mainland Vietnam in August \r\n1966 as they clearly show no Vietnam service during this time \r\nperiod.  Furthermore, Vietnam casualty logs do not confirm \r\nthe supposed death of Purcell nor do the deck logs record \r\nPurcell's unavailability for duty due to injury or death.  In \r\nfact, the Head of the Ships History Branch of the Naval \r\nHistorical Center opined that it was \"improbable, to say the \r\nleast,\" that aircraft carrier personnel would be assigned to \r\nthe salvage mission described by the veteran.\r\n\r\nThe veteran's January 1997 testimony completely contradicts \r\nhis report to VA examiners of witnessing a soldier being \r\nkilled or mutilated by rotating propellers.  At this hearing, \r\nhe testified that he did not actually witness the event.  \r\nRather, this incident consisted of viewing a \"kind of messed \r\nup\" individual being transported by stretcher to sick bay.  \r\nQuite simply, the version of this non-combat stressor relied \r\nupon by the VA examiners in arriving at a PTSD diagnosis did \r\nnot happen.  The Board also notes that the veteran appears to \r\nhave recanted his original assertion, contained in a March \r\n1995 VA mental health clinic visit, that he \"frequently ran \r\ninto combat\" on mainland visits.  Overall, the veteran's \r\nreport of stressors while serving on the USS CORAL SEA lack \r\nany indicia of reliability or credibility.  Certainly, there \r\nis no credible supporting evidence of these alleged \r\nstressors.\r\n\r\nBased upon the above, the Board finds that the preponderance \r\nof the evidence establishes that the veteran was not engaged \r\nin combat, and that his allegations of exposure to combat and \r\nnon-combat stressors are not credible.  The Board, therefore, \r\nfinds that the veteran's PTSD is not shown to have its \r\norigins in his military service.  As the veteran was not \r\nengaged in combat, the evidentiary presumptions contained in \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) are not \r\napplicable in this case.  Furthermore, there is no doubt of \r\nmaterial fact to be resolved in the veteran's favor.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b) (West Supp. 2001).  The claim for \r\nservice connection for PTSD, therefore, must be denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tC.W.

O'Brien, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from May 1975 to May 1978.  \r\n\r\nThis appeal arises from a May 1994 rating decision of the \r\nVARO in Detroit, Michigan, which denied entitlement to \r\nservice connection for PTSD on the basis that there was no \r\ncredible supporting evidence of an alleged inservice \r\nstressor. \r\n\r\nThe matter was before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\nin July 1998 at which time it was remanded for further \r\ndevelopment.  The case has been returned to the Board for \r\nappellate review.  \r\n\r\nIn a February 2001 statement, the veteran referred to \r\nexcessive treatment during service for alcohol abuse.  To the \r\nextent that he is claiming service connection for alcohol \r\nabuse or a psychiatric disorder other than PTSD, those \r\nmatters are not for consideration by the Board at this time \r\nsince they have not been developed or adjudicated.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The veteran's records establish that he had no combat \r\nwith the enemy and he has not contended otherwise.\r\n\r\n2.  Despite extensive efforts, the veteran's reported \r\nstressful incident in service has not been verified by any \r\nsource and he has not been able to submit specific \r\ninformation which would permit verification from official \r\nsources.  \r\n\r\n3.  The evidence does not establish that the veteran \r\ncurrently has PTSD that may be associated with his military \r\nservice or any verified incident in service.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe veteran does not have PTSD that was incurred in or \r\naggravated by his active service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131, \r\n5107 (West Supp. 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 \r\n(2001).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nInitially, the Board notes that there has been a significant \r\nchange in the law during the pendency of this appeal.  On \r\nNovember 9, 2000, the President signed into law the Veterans \r\nClaims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, \r\n114 Stat. 2096 (2000) (now codified at 38 U.S.C. �� 5102, \r\n5103, 5103A, 5107 (West Supp. 2002).  Among other things, \r\nthis law redefines the obligations of VA with respect to \r\nnotice and the duty to assist.  This change in the law is \r\napplicable to all claims filed on or after the date of \r\nenactment of the VCAA, or filed before the date of enactment \r\nand not yet final as of that date.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A (West \r\nSupp. 2002); see also Karnas v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 308 \r\n(1991).\r\n\r\nVA issued regulations to implement the VCAA in August 2001.  \r\n66 Fed. Reg. 45,620 (August 29, 2001) (to be codified as \r\namended at 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, and \r\n3.326(a)).  In general where the record demonstrates that the \r\nstatutory mandates have been satisfied, the regulatory \r\nprovisions likewise are satisfied. \r\n\r\nUnder the new legislation, VA shall make reasonable efforts \r\nto assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to \r\nsubstantiate his claim for a benefit under a law administered \r\nby the Secretary, unless no reasonable possibility exists \r\nthat such assistance would aid in substantiating the claim.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A (West Supp. 2001).  \r\n\r\nOnce the evidence has been assembled, it is the Board's \r\nresponsibility to evaluate the evidence.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 7104(a).  The Secretary shall consider all information and \r\nlay and medical evidence of record in the case before the \r\nSecretary with respect to benefits under laws administered by \r\nthe Secretary.  When there is an approximate balance of \r\npositive and negative evidence regarding any issue material \r\nto the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give \r\nthe benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107 \r\n(West Supp. 2001).  \r\n\r\nThe Board has considered the effect of this new legislation \r\nas it pertains to the veteran's claim and finds that no \r\nfurther development is necessary as to this issue.  \r\nBernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384 (1993).  In the instant \r\ncase, the evidence of record includes numerous reports of \r\npsychiatric treatment and evaluation of the veteran in the \r\nyears following service.  In addition, in a 1998 decision, \r\nthe Board remanded the case for further development.  \r\nFurther, the veteran was given the opportunity to provide a \r\nhearing before a hearing officer at the Detroit RO in \r\nSeptember 1994.  Communications are of record from various \r\nservice department representatives and the claims folder \r\nincludes private, VA, and Social Security Administration \r\nrecords.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that the \r\ndiscussions in the rating decisions, the statement of the \r\ncase, the supplemental statements of the case, the veteran's \r\ntestimony at his personal hearing, have all in effect \r\ninformed the veteran of the information and evidence needed \r\nto substantiate his claim in complying with the VA \r\nnotification requirements. See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103.\r\n\r\nThe RO has made more than reasonable efforts to assist the \r\nveteran in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate his \r\nclaim.  No reasonable possibility exists that any further \r\nassistance would aid in substantiating the claim and the RO \r\nhas therefore met its duty to assist the veteran.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A (West Supp. 2002).  No further \r\ndevelopment is required in order to comply with VA's duty to \r\nassist.  \r\n\r\nFactual Background  \r\n\r\nThe veteran's service medical records are without reference \r\nto the alleged incident in which the veteran killed a fellow \r\nMarine while on guard duty at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot \r\nin San Diego, California, in July 1975.  The records do show \r\nhe was hospitalized at the National Naval Medical Center in \r\nBethesda, Maryland, from November 7, 1977, to December 16, \r\n1977, for habitual excessive drinking.  He reported that his \r\npresent high level of alcohol abuse had begun about one year \r\nearlier during the break up of his marriage.  The veteran \r\nadmitted that while intoxicated, he had a personality change \r\nwhich led to increasing hostility and irritability.  He \r\nstated he would frequently fight during these time frames.  \r\nHe reported that in the past he had been charged with driving \r\nunder the influence of alcohol and he admitted that in \r\ncivilian life he had been arrested on two occasions for \r\nalcohol-related incidents.  A detailed history was provided \r\nand it was determined that after an adequate period of \r\nevaluation and treatment, the diagnosis was habitual \r\nexcessive drinking, chronic, severe, in remission.  \r\n\r\nThe post service evidence includes reports of VA outpatient \r\nvisits on previous occasions in 1991.  At the time of one \r\nsuch visit in June 1991, the veteran expressed a complaint of \r\nan inability to work.  The veteran stated he had had problems \r\nwhile in the military and thereafter.  He did not elaborate \r\nas to the reported problems in the military.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran was accorded a psychiatric examination for rating \r\npurposes by VA in October 1991.  It was indicated that he \r\npresented with a confusing history with multiple symptoms.  \r\nThe veteran stated that while in service, he reported \r\nrecollections of an incident when he was serving as a guard \r\nand was told no one could leave a training area.  However, he \r\nindicated one of the recruits tried to leave.  The veteran \r\nrecalled that he stood in front of the individual, held out \r\nhis hand, and said \"halt.\"  He further related that the \r\nindividual put his hands up as to push the veteran to get by \r\nhim, and the veteran then hit him with the butt of his gun.  \r\nHe stated that the blow broke the individual's neck and \r\nkilled him instantly.  He thought that it might have been one \r\nof the drill sergeants who was only pretending to be a \r\nrecruit in order to test him.  He stated there was no \r\nofficial inquiry held after the incident, but he added that \r\nhe thereafter became mean and violent.  The veteran stated \r\nthat following service, he had a brief period of \r\nhospitalization in 1986 in a stress unit after having a \r\nrun-in with his bosses at an automobile plant where he was \r\nthen working.  He reported another admission at the VA \r\nMedical Center in Ann Arbor in 1990 with symptoms of \r\ndepression which were felt to be part of a post-concussive \r\nsyndrome.  He added that earlier in 1990 he had sustained a \r\nhead injury while in a motor vehicle accident.  He stated \r\nthat since that time he had had increasing problems with \r\ndepression, physical fatigue, and hypersomnolence.  It was \r\nreported the veteran had been followed in the VA mental \r\nhygiene clinic for about one year.  Working diagnoses at the \r\npresent time included paranoid personality disorder, \r\nalcoholism, depression, and a question of PTSD.  It was \r\nremarked that the veteran had a longstanding history of \r\nproblems with anger and aggression, paranoid feelings, panic \r\nattacks, and depressive symptoms complicated by a history of \r\nongoing alcohol abuse that was difficult to quantitate.  He \r\nalso related a history of a head injury with subsequent \r\nsyndrome of prominent fatigue, which did not appear clearly \r\nrelated to his depressive symptomatology.  Notation was made \r\nthat in addition, the veteran related an incident while in \r\nservice when he inadvertently killed an individual by a blow \r\nto the head.  The examiner stated the differential diagnosis \r\nshould include paranoid personality disorder, schizophrenia, \r\nintermittent explosive disorder, depressive disorder, and \r\norganic mental disorder related to the head injury.  \r\nAdditionally, one was to consider the possibility of a \r\nconversion disorder.  The Axis I diagnoses were probable \r\nalcohol abuse and rule out depressive disorder.  The Axis II \r\ndiagnosis was a paranoid personality disorder.  \r\n\r\nAdditional medical evidence includes the report of \r\nhospitalization of the veteran at the VA Medical Center in \r\nBattle Creek, Michigan, from April to June 1992.  The Axis I \r\ndiagnoses were:  Depressive disorder; probable drug-induced \r\nhallucinosis with paranoid features; chronic and continuous \r\nalcohol and polydrug dependence; and PTSD.  There was no \r\nAxis II diagnosis.  \r\n\r\nAt the time of a personal hearing before a hearing officer at \r\nthe RO in September 1994, the veteran testified that while on \r\nguard duty during basic training, he hit another Marine with \r\nhis rifle after the individual refused to stop, and tried to \r\nrun past him.  He did not think the Marine was a member of \r\nhis platoon.  He believed the man might have been a recruit \r\nfrom another platoon in his training cycle or that the \r\nindividual might already have graduated from boot camp.\r\n\r\nReference was made at the hearing to a March 1994 statement \r\nfrom a friend of the veteran who corroborated several aspects \r\nof the veteran's alleged stressor.  \r\n\r\nAlso of record is an April 1994 letter from the head of the \r\nRecords Correspondence Section of the Personnel Management \r\nSupport Branch, Headquarters, United States Marine Corps.  \r\nThat individual stated that a search of the unit diaries \r\nsubmitted by the Personnel Support Battalion, Recruit \r\nTraining Regiment, Marine Corps Recruit Depot, did not show \r\nany member of the veteran's unit as having been killed during \r\nthe period of time the veteran was attached to the unit.  \r\nThat unit was identified as Platoon 3054 in the RO's April \r\n1994 search request.\r\n\r\nAlso at the September 1994 hearing, the veteran stated he was \r\nnot aware that any investigation of the alleged incident ever \r\ntook place.  \r\n\r\nSubsequent medical evidence includes varying psychiatric \r\ndiagnoses, including bipolar affective disorder with \r\npsychotic features which was diagnosed following \r\nhospitalization of the veteran by VA from March to April \r\n1995.  \r\n\r\nAdditional evidence of record includes an August 1998 \r\nstatement from the head of Correspondence Unit No. 12, \r\nRecords Correspondence Section, Personnel Management Support \r\nBranch, Headquarters, United States Marine Corps in Quantico, \r\nVirginia, to the effect that there were no means available by \r\nwhich the senior drill instructor of Platoon 3054 in July \r\n1975 could be verified.  It was noted the information would \r\nbe in the platoon graduation yearbook.  It was stated that \r\nresearch regarding the death of a Marine recruit had \r\npreviously been conducted in April 1994.  Reference was made \r\nto the April 1994 communication mentioned elsewhere in this \r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nIn a December 1999 communication the same individual stated \r\nthat another unit diary search had been completed and there \r\nwas \"no Marine recruit killed as previously stated in our \r\nattached letters.\"  The individual remarked that anecdotal \r\nincidents, although they might be true, were not \r\nresearchable.  The individual further stated that it was \r\nstandard operative procedure required by regulation to hold \r\nan investigation regarding any death or serious injury.  \r\n\r\nOf record is a May 2000 communication from the veteran's \r\nmother to the effect that he was a completely changed person \r\non his return home from active service.  She stated that \r\nabout 10 years after his discharge from service, the veteran \r\ntold his oldest sister that he had killed another Marine \r\nduring maneuvers while stationed in California.  She related \r\nthat the incident in question involved the veteran hitting \r\nanother Marine with the butt of his rifle when the individual \r\ntried to \"get through the guards undetected\" and fell dead.  \r\nShe went on to say the veteran was relieved of his duty for \r\nthe night and was told to forget the incident and keep his \r\nmouth shut.  \r\n\r\nThe commandant of the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San \r\nDiego, California, was provided a second request by the \r\nservice center manager of the VARO in Detroit in August 2000 \r\nfor any reports or records involving the reported death or \r\nserious head injury of the Marine at that facility in July \r\n1975.  It was noted that while the veteran was in one \r\nplatoon, the incident could have involved a number of several \r\nother platoons or even anyone on the base. \r\n\r\nThe reply came later that same month.  The depot inspector at \r\nthe Marine Corps Recruit Depot indicated that no information \r\nwas found regarding the alleged incident in which the veteran \r\nkilled a fellow Marine while on guard duty during training in \r\nJuly 1975.  \r\n\r\nAlso of record is a communication to the veteran in June 200l \r\nsigned by the director of the VARO in Detroit.  She told the \r\nveteran that during his personal hearing in 1994 he gave the \r\nfirst and last name of a sergeant in his unit.  She informed \r\nthe veteran that the records showed six individuals by that \r\nname had applied for VA benefits, but none of them had served \r\nin the Marine Corps in 1975.  The veteran was asked to locate \r\nthe individual and was told that any evidence submitted from \r\nhim would be considered. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by military \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131.\r\n\r\nWhen the veteran initially filed his claim in the 1990's, \r\nentitlement to service connection for PTSD required medical \r\nevidence establishing a clear diagnosis of the condition with \r\ncredible supporting evidence that the claimed inservice \r\nstressor actually occurred and a link, established by medical \r\nevidence, between the current symptomatology and the claimed \r\ninservice stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1998).  \r\n\r\nThereafter, � 3.304(f) was amended, effective March 7, 1997.  \r\n64 Fed. Reg. 32,807-32,808 (1999).  The amended regulation \r\nprovides:\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with � 4.125(a) of \r\nthis chapter; a link, established by medical evidence, \r\nbetween current symptoms and an inservice stressor; and \r\ncredible supporting evidence that the claimed inservice \r\nstressor occurred.  If the evidence establishes that the \r\nveteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed \r\nstressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear \r\nand convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that \r\nthe claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, \r\nconditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the \r\nveteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of \r\nthe claimed inservice stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2001).\r\n\r\nIn addition, in November 1996 VA regulations were amended to \r\nadopt the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric \r\nAssociations Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \r\nDisorders (4th Edition 1994) (DSM-IV).  38 C.F.R. � 4.130 \r\n(1997).  An earlier version of the text, DSM-III (3rd Edition \r\n1980), was in use by VA at the time the veteran filed his \r\nclaim in the 1990's.  38 C.F.R. � 4.125 (1996).\r\n\r\nIn Karnas v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 308, 312-13 (1991), the \r\nUnited States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) \r\nheld that where a law or regulation changes after a claim has \r\nbeen filed or reopened before the administrative or judicial \r\nappeal process has been concluded, the impression most \r\nfavorable to the appellant applies unless Congress provided \r\notherwise or permitted the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \r\ndo otherwise and the Secretary has done so.\r\n\r\nIn Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 145 (1997), the Court \r\nnoted that a significant change from DSM-III to DSM-IV was \r\nthat the diagnostic criteria for a PTSD stressor (that is, \r\nthe requirements for determining the sufficiency of a claimed \r\nstressor) \"are no longer based solely on visual experience \r\nand response but are individualized (geared to the specific \r\nindividual's actual experience and response).\"  Cohen, at \r\n141.  Subsequently, the Court noted that, \"under Cohen, the \r\nappellant was entitled to receive the benefit on the most \r\nfavorable version of the DSM.\"  Helfer v. West, 11 Vet. \r\nApp. 178, 179 (1998), affirmed, 174 F. 3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. \r\n1999).\r\n\r\nThe evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a \r\nstressor during service to support a claim for entitlement to \r\nservice connection for PTSD will vary depending on whether \r\nthe veteran \"engaged in combat with the enemy.\"  See \r\nGaines v. West, 11 Vet. App. 353, 358 (1998).  If it is \r\ndetermined through military citation or other supportive \r\nevidence that a veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, and \r\nthe claimed stressor(s) are related to combat, the veteran's \r\nlay testimony regarding the reported stressors must be \r\naccepted as conclusive evidence as to their actual occurrence \r\nand no further development or corroborative evidence will be \r\nnecessary, provided that the testimony is found to be \r\nsatisfactory and consistent with the circumstances, \r\nconditions or hardships of such service.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 1154(b) (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d)(f) (2001); \r\nDoran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, 289 (1994).\r\n\r\nService department evidence that the veteran engaged in \r\ncombat or that the veteran was awarded the Purple Heart \r\nMedal, the Combat Infantryman Badge, or similar combat \r\ncitation will be accepted, in the absence of evidence to the \r\ncontrary, as conclusive evidence of the claimed inservice \r\nstressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1998).\r\n\r\nWhere a determination is made that the veteran did not \r\n\"engage in combat with the enemy,\" where the claimed stressor \r\nis not related to combat, the veteran's lay testimony alone \r\nwill not be enough to establish the occurrence of the alleged \r\nstressor.  See Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395 (1996); \r\nDizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 166 (1996).  In such \r\ncases, the record must contain service records or other \r\ncorroborative evidence that substantiates or verifies the \r\nveteran's testimony or statements as to the occurrence of the \r\nclaimed stressor.  See West (Carlton) v. Brown, 7 Vet. \r\nApp. 70, 76 (1994); Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 \r\n(1993).\r\n\r\nThe Board further notes that the Court has held that in view \r\nof the subjective nature of the DSM-IV criteria for assessing \r\nthe sufficiency of a PTSD stressor, the question of the \r\nsufficiency of the asserted stressor(s), in terms of DSM-IV's \r\nrequirements, is a medical question requiring examination and \r\nassessment of the veteran by a mental health professional.  \r\nCohen, supra, at 142, citing West (Carlton) v. Brown, 7 Vet. \r\nApp. 70, 79 (1994).  Furthermore, the Court in Cohen noted \r\nthat \"mental health professionals are experts and are \r\npresumed to know the DSM requirements applicable to their \r\npractice and to have taken them into account in providing a \r\nPTSD diagnosis...\" Id.  \r\n\r\nThe record in this case does not indicate that the veteran \r\never served in combat.  He was not awarded the Purple Heart \r\nMedal, the Combat Infantryman's Badge, or a similar combat \r\ncitation, and it has not been contended otherwise.  He has \r\nreported that he may have killed another Marine during boot \r\ncamp in July 1975.  The record reflects that he has been \r\nhospitalized in the years following service for treatment of \r\nalcoholism and psychiatric symptomatology.  The record shows \r\nthat since 1992 the diagnoses have included PTSD.  It appears \r\nthe PTSD diagnosis has been based on history provided by the \r\nveteran, a history which is essentially substantiated.  \r\n\r\nThe undersigned finds that credible supporting evidence that \r\nthe event described as stressful actually occurred is not of \r\nrecord.  There must be credible evidence supporting the \r\nexistence of a claimed stressor and it is noted that the \r\nCourt has held that the Board correctly rejected a medical \r\nopinion where \"the conclusion reached by the physician [was] \r\nclearly based on the history provided by the veteran.\"  \r\nReonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 460 (1993).  \"[The] Board \r\n[is] not bound to accept opinions of two physicians who made \r\ndiagnoses of PTSD...almost 20 years following appellant's \r\nseparation from service and who necessarily relied on history \r\nas related by appellant.\"  Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. \r\nat 460-461; Swann v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 229, 233 (1993).  The \r\npresumption of credibility of the evidence does not arise \r\nwhere the examining physician relied upon the appellant's \r\naccount of his medical history and service background...[and] \r\n\"an opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no \r\nprobative value.\"  Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 461.  \r\n\r\nDespite extensive efforts, VA has not been able to verify the \r\nveteran's accounts of the stressful incident in which he \r\nreportedly killed a fellow Marine.  As has been noted above, \r\nin different communications of record, VA has been unable to \r\nverify the veteran's accounts of the stressful incident.  In \r\na December 1999 communication, information was obtained that \r\n\"another\" unit diary search was completed with no indication \r\nof mention of any Marine recruit having been killed.  \r\nNotation was made that it was standard operating procedure \r\nfor the Marines as required by regulation to hold an \r\ninvestigation regarding any death or service injury.  In \r\naddition to that correspondence from the Personnel Management \r\nSupport Branch at the Headquarters, United States Marine \r\nCorps, an August 2000 statement from the depot inspector at \r\nthe Marine Corps recruit depot in question indicated that no \r\ninformation had been found regarding the alleged incident \r\ninvolving the death of a Marine in July 1975.  Therefore, in \r\nthe Board's judgment, the evidence which is of record is not \r\nadequate to establish that the events the veteran has \r\nrecalled actually happened and were sufficient to constitute \r\na stressful incident during military service or to convince \r\ndifferent examiners that he has PTSD resulting from the \r\nreported traumatic event experienced during his military \r\nservice.  Accordingly, it follows that service connection for \r\nPTSD is not in order.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f).  The Board has carefully reviewed the entire \r\nrecord with regard to the claim for service connection for \r\nPTSD, but does not find that the evidence is so evenly \r\nbalanced that there is doubt as to any material matter \r\nregarding that issue.   \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is denied.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tF.

H. Mathis, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty in the United States Army \r\nfrom September 1957 to March 1961.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran has sought service connection for a psychiatric \r\ndisability for many years.  In April 1970, the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals (the Board) denied the veteran's claim of \r\nentitlement to service connection for a psychiatric \r\ndisability.  \r\nThe current appeal stems from a November 1992 decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in Fort \r\nHarrison, Montana (the RO) which denied the veteran's claim \r\nof entitlement to service connection for an acquired \r\npsychiatric disability, to include PTSD, based on lack of new \r\nand material evidence.  \r\n\r\nIn a July 1996 decision, the Board declined to reopen the \r\nveteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for an \r\nacquired psychiatric disability, concluding that he had not \r\nsubmitted new and material evidence sufficient to reopen the \r\nclaim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5108 (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. � 3.156 \r\n(2001).  The veteran duly appealed the Board's decision to \r\nthe United States Court of Veterans Appeals (now known as  \r\nthe United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, and \r\nhereinafter referred to in this decision as the Court).  \r\n\r\nWhile the case was pending at the Court, the veteran's \r\nrepresentative and the Office of General Counsel for VA, \r\nwhich represents the Secretary of VA in cases that are \r\nappealed to the Court, filed a joint motion requesting that \r\nthe Court vacate the July 1996 Board decision and remand the \r\ncase for further development and readjudication.  The joint \r\nmotion required that the Board ensure that the veteran was \r\nafforded a VA psychiatric examination with the examiner \r\nhaving the benefit of reviewing the veteran's entire medical \r\nhistory.  The Court granted the joint motion in an October \r\n1997 Order and vacated the Board's July 1996 decision.  The \r\ncase was returned to the Board for further action consistent \r\nwith the order.  In June 1998, the Board remanded the case to \r\nthe RO in accordance with the Court's instructions.  \r\n\r\nFollowing development of the case, the RO continued to deny \r\nthe veteran's claim for service connection for an acquired \r\npsychiatric disability, to include PTSD.  Supplemental \r\nstatements of the case were issued in February 1999 and July \r\n2000.  The case was returned to the Board in May 2001.\r\n\r\nIn February 2002, the Board obtained an independent medical \r\nexpert (IME) opinion regarding several questions associated \r\nwith the veteran's claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 7109 (West \r\n1991).  The veteran's representative was thereupon accorded \r\nthe opportunity of presenting additional evidence and \r\nargument in support of the claim.  A written brief was \r\nsubmitted in March 2002.  This case now stands ready for \r\nappellate review.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe record establishes that the veteran has a diagnosis of \r\nPTSD, which has been related to a stressor he experienced \r\nduring his active military service.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe veteran's PTSD was incurred as a result of his military \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1131 (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, \r\n3.304(f) (2001).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe veteran is seeking entitlement to service connection for \r\na psychiatric disability, including PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe Board observes in passing that, as noted in the \r\nIntroduction, this case was decided by the Board in its now \r\nvacated July 1996 decision because, in the opinion of the \r\nBoard, new and material evidence which was sufficient to \r\nreopen the veteran's claim had not been submitted.  However, \r\nthe October 1997 joint motion for remand, which was granted \r\nby the Court, made it clear that this case was to be decided \r\non a de novo basis.  The order of the Court is the law of the \r\ncase.  See Chisem v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 526 (1997).  \r\nSubsequent actions by the Board and the RO recognized that \r\nthe matter of submission of new and material evidence had \r\nbeen resolved by the Court.   \r\n\r\nIn the interest of clarity, the Board will review the \r\napplicable law and regulations, briefly describe the factual \r\nbackground of this case, and then proceed to analyze the \r\nclaim and render a decision.  \r\n\r\nRelevant Law and Regulations\r\n\r\nService connection\r\n\r\nIn general, the applicable law and regulations provide that \r\nservice connection may be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by \r\nmilitary service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1131 (West Supp. 2001); \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (2001).  \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the lack of a diagnosis of a disability \r\nduring service, service connection may still be granted if \r\nall of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, \r\nestablishes that the disorder was incurred in service.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1113(b) (West Supp. 2001); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d) \r\n(2001); Cosman v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 503, 505 (1992).\r\n\r\nCongenital or developmental defects such as personality \r\ndisorders are not diseases or injuries for the purposes of \r\nservice connection.  38 C.F.R. �� 3.303(c), 4.9 (2001).  See \r\nWinn v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 510, 516 (1996), and cases cited \r\ntherein.  \r\n\r\n\r\nService connection - PTSD\r\n\r\nIn order for service connection to be awarded for PTSD, three \r\nelements must be present: (1) a current medical diagnosis of \r\nPTSD; (2) medical evidence of a causal nexus between current \r\nsymptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor; and (3) \r\ncredible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service \r\nstressor actually occurred.  38 C.F.R. 3.304(f) (2001); \r\nMoreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389 (1996).  \r\n\r\nIn Zarycki v. Brown, the Court set forth the analytical \r\nframework and line of reasoning for determining whether a \r\nveteran was exposed to a recognizable stressor during \r\nservice, which, as discussed above, is an essential element \r\nin solidifying a claim for service connection for PTSD.  See \r\nZarycki v. Brown 6 Vet. App. 91 (1993).  In Zarycki, it was \r\nnoted that, under 38 U.S.C.A. 1154(b), 38 C.F.R. 3.304(d) and \r\n(f), and the applicable provisions contained in VA Manual 21-\r\n1, the evidence necessary to establish the incurrence of a \r\nrecognizable stressor during service to support a claim of \r\nservice connection for PTSD will vary depending on whether \r\nthe veteran \"engaged in combat with the enemy.\"  See Hayes v. \r\nBrown, 5 Vet. App. 60 (1993).  The determination as to \r\nwhether the veteran \"engaged in combat with the enemy\" is \r\nmade, in part, by considering military citations that \r\nexpressly denote as much.  Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, \r\n289 (1994).  However, the Court has held that the Board may \r\nnot rely strictly on combat citations or the veteran's \r\nMilitary Occupational Specialty to determine if he engaged in \r\ncombat; rather, other supportive evidence of combat \r\nexperience may also be accepted.  See Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 \r\nVet. App. 163, 166 (1996); West v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 70, 76 \r\n(1994).  If combat is affirmatively indicated, then the \r\nveteran's lay testimony regarding claimed combat-related \r\nstressors must be accepted as conclusive as to their actual \r\noccurrence and no further development or corroborative \r\nevidence will be required, provided that the veteran's \r\ntestimony is found to be \"satisfactory,\" i.e., credible, and \r\n\"consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof such service.\"  Zarycki, 6 Vet. App. at 98.\r\n\r\nIf there is no combat experience, or if there is a \r\ndetermination that the veteran engaged in combat but the \r\nclaimed stressor is not related to such combat, there must be \r\nindependent evidence to corroborate the veteran's statement \r\nas to the occurrence of the claimed stressor.  Doran v. \r\nBrown, 6 Vet. App. at 288-89 (1994).  The veteran's \r\ntestimony, by itself, cannot, as a matter of law, establish \r\nthe occurrence of a non-combat stressor.  Dizoglio v. Brown, \r\n9 Vet. App. at 166 (1996).  Further, an opinion by a mental \r\nhealth professional based on a post-service examination of \r\nthe veteran cannot be used to establish the occurrence of a \r\nstressor.  Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. at 395-96 (1996); \r\nCohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).\r\n\r\nStandard of review\r\n\r\nOnce the evidence has been assembled, the Board has the duty \r\nto assess the credibility and weight to be given to the \r\nevidence.  See Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. \r\nCir. 1997) and cases cited therein.  When there is an \r\napproximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an \r\nissue material to the determination of the matter, the \r\nbenefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be \r\ngiven to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107 (West Supp. 2001); \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.102 (2001).  In Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. \r\nApp. 49, 53 (1990), the Court stated that a claimant need \r\nonly demonstrate that there is an approximate balance of \r\npositive and negative evidence in order to prevail.  To deny \r\na claim on its merits, the evidence must preponderate against \r\nthe claim.  Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996), \r\nciting Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 54.\r\n\r\nFactual Background\r\n\r\nThere were normal psychiatric findings on enlistment \r\nexamination in September 1957.  The veteran denied having any \r\npsychiatric problems on the accompanying medical history \r\nquestionnaire.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran's service administrative records include the \r\nreport of a special court martial conviction.  This document \r\nshows that in July 1959, the veteran accidentally discharged \r\nhis weapon in his unit area  through his own carelessness.  \r\nThe court martial report did not make mention of any injuries \r\nsustained by any persons as a result of the accident.  The \r\nveteran was initially sentenced to confinement at hard labor \r\nfor three months, forfeiture of 25 dollars of pay per month \r\nfor three months and reduction in rank.  The unexecuted \r\nportion of this sentence was subsequently remitted by special \r\ncourt martial order in October 1959.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran re-enlisted for a second tour of duty in December \r\n1959.  The report of his medical examination on reenlistment \r\nshows that he was assessed as psychiatrically normal on \r\nclinical evaluation in December 1959 and that he reported \r\nthat he did not have any history of psychiatric problems.  \r\n\r\nAccording to a psychiatric consultation in July 1960, \"(the \r\nveteran) accidentally shot a fellow soldier while on guard \r\npost . . . , approximately a year ago.  (The) incident has \r\nbegun to prey on his mind and seriously affect his efficiency \r\nand morale.  (The veteran was) in a rapid state of mental \r\ndeterioration.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing hospital admission in July 1960, the veteran, then \r\n20 years of age, was interviewed, examined and subjected to a \r\nperiod of observation.  He reported problems of increasing \r\nrestlessness, tension, suicidal thoughts and irritability.  \r\nDuring the mental status examination, he displayed a rather \r\nflat affect and stated that in the past year or so since his \r\nmother's illness he had been feeling more withdrawn and \r\ndetached and more irritable and worrisome.  There was no \r\nevidence of ideas of reference or psychotic ideation, though \r\nhe appeared to be somewhat suspicious about the motives of \r\nthe people who court-martialed him.  It was the opinion of \r\nthe psychiatric staff that he was not homicidal but rather \r\nrepresented a passive-aggressive character which was \r\nconfirmed on psychological testing.  \r\nHe was diagnosed with passive-aggressive reaction, manifested \r\nby increasing tension, difficulty with authority, alleged \r\ndifficulty restraining hostile impulses and manipulative \r\npropensities.  The stress was described as the accidental \r\nshooting.\r\nThe veteran was thereafter discharged from the hospital to \r\nfull active duty with the comment that he was mentally sound \r\nand responsible for his behavior.  \r\n\r\nPersonnel records dated in early 1961 reflect that the \r\nveteran began to display disruptive behavior and conduct \r\nhimself in a militarily inappropriate manner in his \r\nrelationships with his peers and superiors.  His disruptive \r\nbehavior persisted to the point that he was referred for \r\npsychiatric examination in February 1961.  \r\n\r\nThe report of the February 1961 neuropsychiatric examination \r\nshows that it was noted that the veteran had previously been \r\nexamined and psychiatrically diagnosed with a passive-\r\naggressive reaction.  Since his release from the hospital in \r\nAugust 1960, he performed fairly well for several months but \r\nbecame increasingly disgusted with military service and \r\nreturned to the psychiatric clinic in February 1961 stating \r\nthat he was reaching the end of his ability to tolerate his \r\nsituation and was having increased difficulty adjusting to \r\nmilitary service.  \r\n\r\nThe report of mental status examination in February 1961 \r\nshows that the veteran was essentially the same as he was in \r\nJuly and August 1960.  The diagnosis was passive-aggressive \r\nreaction manifested by increasing tension, difficulty with \r\nauthority, alleged difficulty restraining hostile impulses \r\nand manipulative propensities.  In his commentary, the \r\nreviewing psychiatrist reported that the veteran had a \r\ndefinite diagnosis fitting into the category of an immaturity \r\nreaction.  There was no evidence of psychosis and he was not \r\nable to be discharged through medical channels.  The \r\npsychiatrist commented further that it was most reasonable to \r\nhave the veteran administratively discharged from service as \r\nhis motivation for service was rather poor and, when combined \r\nwith his character defect, made rehabilitation impractical.  \r\n\r\nThe report of the veteran's separation examination in \r\nFebruary 1961 reflects that the veteran was normal on \r\npsychiatric evaluation.  On his medical history, he reported \r\nhaving nervous trouble, frequent trouble sleeping, and \r\ndepression or frequent worry.  He noted that he had \r\npreviously been psychiatrically hospitalized in July 1960, \r\nand that he had accidentally shot a fellow soldier, which \r\nseriously affected the veteran's efficiency and morale.  \r\n\r\nIn a February 1961 witness statement, one of the veteran's \r\nsuperior officers, Lt. C., described the veteran's service \r\nhistory noting that the veteran told him that he had finally \r\nadmitted to himself that the shooting incident was not the \r\nreal problem preying on his mind, but that it was feelings of \r\nworry over his aging mother, and that his mother held a \r\ncloser and more tenacious hold on his emotions and actions \r\nthan did most other parents.  The veteran also had problems \r\nregarding the promotion of other individuals ahead of \r\nhimself.  Lt. C. reported that all attempts at rehabilitation \r\nwere unsuccessful and the veteran was to be discharged from \r\nactive duty as he was deemed to have been no longer of any \r\nvalue to the armed services.  \r\n\r\nIn a certified statement dated in February 1961, Capt. S. \r\ndiscussed the veteran's service history and related that the \r\nveteran's only desire was to get out of service by any means, \r\neven if he had to shoot someone again.  After the veteran's \r\nFebruary 1961 psychiatric examination, Capt. S. was of the \r\nopinion that problems would follow the veteran wherever he \r\nwent and a speedy discharge from service as an undesirable \r\nwas strongly recommended.  \r\n\r\nIn March 1961, the veteran was discharged from military \r\nservice.  His discharge was characterized at the time as \r\nbeing Under Honorable Conditions.\r\n\r\nPost-service medical records show that the veteran was \r\nadmitted to a VA hospital in October 1969 with complaints of \r\nnervousness and depression since military service in 1961.  \r\nThe medical examiner found it interesting to note that the \r\nveteran had never been hospitalized for nervousness or \r\ndepression since his hospitalization in the military in 1961 \r\nand that he did not consult a physician for his symptoms \r\nuntil July 1969.  He claimed that he did not seek treatment \r\nuntil this point because his symptoms had become worse only \r\nin the past few months.  The diagnostic impression was \r\nanxiety reaction, chronic, with depressive features.  \r\n\r\nIn July 1972, the veteran was hospitalized by VA for \r\ncomplaints of depression, disturbed sleep, and feeling \r\n\"edgy\" and indecisive.  He indicated hat he had been \r\ndiscouraged because he was unable to find employment and \r\ncomplained of having marked feelings of inferiority and \r\ninadequacy.  The diagnosis was depressive reaction.  \r\n\r\nAs previously reported, the veteran was initially discharged \r\nfrom military service in March 1961 Under Honorable \r\nConditions.  Approximately a decade later, in the 1970s, he \r\napplied for a character of service upgrade.  The report of an \r\nArmy Discharge Review Board shows that the veteran contended \r\nthat he had been discharged for a personality disorder and \r\nnot for misconduct; that there was doubt present about his \r\nmental condition at the time of discharge; that he was only \r\n21 years old at that time having joined the Army at 17; that \r\nhe had obtained a GED in the Army and completed aircraft \r\nmechanics school, but that he was unable to work for any \r\nairlines because of the character of his discharge.  \r\n\r\nThe report shows that the Army Discharge Review Board \r\nexamined the veteran's service record and found that he was \r\nconvicted for a careless discharge of his weapon but that it \r\nwas not indicated that anyone was injured during the \r\nincident.  Psychiatric evaluation reports from service \r\nindicated to the Army Discharge Review Board that he had a \r\ndefinite diagnosis which fit into the category of an immature \r\nreaction and that rehabilitation was impractical.  The \r\nservice medical records indicated that on three occasions he \r\nwas diagnosed with a character and behavior disorder.  \r\n\r\nThe Army Discharge Review Board unanimously determined in \r\nJune 1980 that the veteran's character of service should be \r\nupgraded to Honorable on the grounds that current standards \r\nmandated an honorable discharge for those individuals who are \r\ndischarged for a personality disorder and whose record did \r\nnot reflect more than one special court martial or an \r\nindication of a general court martial.  \r\n\r\nA June 1992 VA consultation report notes that the veteran had \r\na long history of character disorder.  The impression was \r\npassive-aggressive personality disorder.  \r\n\r\nIn a November 1992 statement, the veteran's private \r\nphysician, L.H., M.D., reported that he first saw the veteran \r\nin April 1992, when he was under considerable nervous strain \r\nand tension.  The veteran was not seen again until August \r\n1992, and according to Dr. H. it was apparent that for years \r\nthe veteran had suffered from a chronic stress directly \r\nconnected to his military service.  Dr. H. felt from a review \r\nof the veteran's history that he entered active duty without \r\nany problems, but that during the course of his service \r\nemotional problems evolved.  \r\n\r\nIn an October 1993 statement, a VA psychiatrist, Dr. McD., \r\nreported that the veteran had been seen approximately four \r\ntimes in the previous months for treatment of recurrent major \r\ndepression with the possibility of a subacute bipolar \r\ndisorder.  \r\n\r\nA June 1993 VA treatment report reflects the above diagnosis \r\nof depression made by Dr. H. and also a recent psychiatric \r\nconsultation which indicated that a personality disorder \r\nexisted.  The VA physician commented that this might be true, \r\nthough he was unable to tell from his interview with the \r\nveteran, and that the veteran's history was at least \r\nconsistent with dysthymia.  \r\n\r\nIn a June 1995 VA psychological assessment at the PTSD \r\nclinic, it was reported that tests produced a psychological \r\nassessment which was very consistent and supportive of a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD of mild to moderate severity, but that the \r\npsychological assessment results alone were not sufficient to \r\nprovide a diagnosis of PTSD and that interview and other \r\ncollateral information was needed to explore other possible \r\ndiagnoses suggested by the psychological assessment.  \r\n\r\nThe May 1995 report of a VA psychiatric examination of the \r\nveteran which was conducted by Dr. R.G. and Dr. T.T. shows \r\nthat the veteran presented a 35-year history of recurrent \r\ndepression manifested by very prolonged periods of mood \r\nirritability, a sense of hopelessness, inferiority, \r\nrestlessness and dissatisfaction with his life.  He also \r\nexperienced varying sleep disturbances.  The veteran could \r\nnot recall the name of the man he accidentally shot in \r\nservice and reported that he experienced only occasional \r\ndreams about the incident, although shortly after the \r\nincident he had had frequent dreams and memories of the \r\nepisode along with general dissatisfaction and a depressed \r\nmood.  The examiners identified no evidence of a formal \r\nthought disorder, and noted that there were no spontaneous \r\nverbalizations of symptoms related to the shooting incident \r\nby the veteran.  The diagnoses were probable bipolar disorder \r\nand a mixed-type affective disorder on Axis I.  On Axis II, \r\nthe diagnosis was Cluster C characteristics personality \r\ndisorder, features of avoidant, passive-aggressive and \r\ndependent personality traits.  In their commentary regarding \r\nPTSD, the psychiatric examiners reported that the veteran's \r\nexamination results on psychological testing were similar to \r\nthat seen in combat-related PTSD.  However, upon their review \r\nof the test results, Drs. R.G. and T.T. opined that the \r\nveteran's symptoms of social relationship difficulties could \r\nstem from his long history of social inferiority and did not \r\nnecessarily need to be attributed to PTSD, and that the \r\naffective symptoms were clearer in his history than were \r\nthose of PTSD.  \r\n\r\nIn a September 1995 letter from the Vet Center in Billings, \r\nMontana, Mr. B.P., MSW, agreed with the diagnosis of PTSD \r\nwhich was made in June 1995 and opined that the veteran met \r\nthe criteria for PTSD and for treatment of PTSD as his \r\nrecords verify the event of a stressor and his social history \r\ndisplayed PTSD symptoms after the event.  \r\n\r\nIn a December 1995 VA treatment report, a VA physician, Dr. \r\nL.S., reported that based on the report of psychiatric intake \r\nfrom the VA as well as a psychological report, PTSD seemed to \r\nbe pretty well documented by that testing.  \r\n\r\nThe claims file includes the report of a private psychiatric \r\nexamination conducted in March 1996 by Dr. D.B.  Reportedly, \r\nthe veteran's motivation was to present new evidence to open \r\nhis claim for PTSD that he contended was service-connected, \r\nand that if he were found not to have PTSD, then he wanted to \r\naddress the question of whether he suffered from some other \r\nseverely disabling service-connected psychiatric disability.  \r\nFollowing an interview and testing of the veteran, Dr. D.B. \r\nentered the diagnosis of probable PTSD under the criteria of \r\nDSM-IV, chronic with delayed onset, with alcohol dependence \r\nin complete remission for 19 years.  Dr. D.B. also stated \r\nthat an alternative diagnosis of a major mood disorder, major \r\ndepression, recurrent and severe, should be entertained.  In \r\ndiscussion, Dr. D.B. commented that the veteran's PTSD \r\ndiagnosis was not clear-cut.  The weakest point in the \r\ncriteria was evidence that a response of \"intense fear, \r\nhelplessness or horror\" occurred at the time of the event.  \r\nThe veteran insisted that he had little direct memory of the \r\naccidental shooting episode and was not sure how he responded \r\nat the time and in the immediate aftermath.  What was clear \r\nto Dr. D.B. was that the veteran was not psychiatrically ill \r\nwhen he entered service, that he served successfully for more \r\nthan two years, and that he was involved in an accidental \r\nshooting during that time.  He then developed a serious, \r\ndisabling psychiatric disability which did not respond well \r\nto treatment.  He left the service with a serious mental \r\nillness and this illness plagued him and handicapped him \r\nseverely ever since.  He was alcoholic for a time, but the \r\npsychiatrist did not believe that alcoholism was the \r\nveteran's primary illness, nor did it cause the mental \r\nillness, and was not a necessary contributor to its \r\npersistence.  \r\n\r\nIn a September 1996 VA treatment report, Dr. L.S., the VA \r\nphysician who had made a statement in December 1995, further \r\nobserved that he was looking more at PTSD as a diagnosis than \r\nanything else.  \r\n\r\nAs noted in the Introduction, in June 1998 the Board remanded \r\nthis case so that the veteran could be scheduled for a \r\npsychiatric examination.  In January 1999, the veteran \r\nunderwent a psychological consultation conducted by Dr. M., a \r\nneuropsychologist, on referral by VA.  Concerning the \r\nshooting incident, the veteran reported that in 1958 he was \r\non guard duty and accidentally shot a fellow soldier in the \r\nhip.  According to his account, the incident upset and scared \r\nthe veteran.  He recalled being slapped in the face by an \r\nofficer soon after the shooting.  He reported that he lost \r\nrank, was subjected to court martial proceedings and was \r\ngiven a suspended sentence.  He stated that his history of \r\nhaving difficulty taking orders from others started shortly \r\nthereafter.  \r\n\r\nDr. M.'s assessment summary shows that the veteran was \r\nsuspicious, avoidant and angry with others.  He was likely to \r\nbe argumentative in the course of his relationships.  He \r\ntended to attribute much of his dysfunction to the accidental \r\nshooting incident during his period of military service.  It \r\nappeared to Dr. M. that most of the veteran's symptoms \r\nassociated with PTSD were better accounted for by his \r\nlongstanding depression, anxiety and personality disorder.  \r\nThe accidental shooting would, in the words of Dr. M., be \r\ncertainly traumatic and bothersome for any average \r\nindividual, but the veteran lacked the psychological \r\nresources to adapt to relationships and normal life demands.  \r\nDr. M. concluded by stating that the veteran's \"mood problems \r\nand character style would certainly be evident in his history \r\nwhether he spent time in the military or not.\"\r\n\r\nDr. M. entered diagnoses on Axis I of chronic dysthymia \r\ndisorder with a significant anxiety component; history of \r\nrecurrent major depressive episodes which were in partial or \r\nfull remission at the time of the examination; rule out \r\nbipolar II disorder; and history of alcohol abuse, resolved \r\nby report of the veteran, and in remote history.  On Axis II, \r\nthe diagnosis was mixed personality disorder with prominent \r\npassive-aggressive features.  \r\n\r\nIn January 2002, the Board requested an IME opinion.  The IME \r\nwas requested to review the veteran's claims file and all \r\npertinent medical records contained therein and render an \r\nopinion, with reasons provided, which addressed the following \r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n(1.)  Based on a review of the veteran's entire medical \r\nhistory, was the diagnosis of a personality disorder \r\nmade during active service a correct one? \r\n\r\n(2.)  What is the veteran's most likely current \r\npsychiatric diagnosis or diagnoses?  If possible, \r\nspecific DSM-IV criteria supporting any diagnosis made \r\nshould be identified. \r\n  \r\n(3.)  Does the veteran currently have an acquired \r\npsychiatric disorder which is due to his military \r\nservice or any incident thereof?  If so, what is its \r\ndiagnosis?\r\n\r\nIn February 2002, in response to the Board's request, the \r\nIME, Dr. J.E., Professor and Chairman of the Department of \r\nPsychiatry at a medical school, reviewed the veteran's claims \r\nfolders.  Dr. J.E. initially determined that it was \r\nreasonable to conclude from the medical evidence of record \r\nthat the veteran had a \"traumatic incident\" when, at age \r\n18, he accidentally shot a fellow soldier and experienced \r\nloss of rank, court-martial and transfer; that one year later \r\nthe veteran was hospitalized with anxiety/depression symptoms \r\nwhen the diagnosis was \"stress/accidental shooting\" and \r\n\"passive-aggressive reaction.\"  Dr. J.E. also noted that \r\nthere was a diagnosis of anxiety neurosis in the mid 70's, \r\ndiagnoses of bipolar/mixed affective/cluster C personality \r\ntraits in the mid 90's, and PTSD/chronic delayed onset and \r\nmajor depressive disorder also in the mid 90's.  \r\n\r\nDr. J.E. noted that the presence of Axis II \"Personality \r\ntraits\" had been highlighted throughout the years (Passive, \r\nAggressive, Cluster C, etc.); and that the detailed \r\nassessment in January 1999 revealed that through the years \r\nthe veteran experienced the following PTSD symptoms: exposure \r\nto a traumatic event, recurrent/\r\nintensive/distressing recollections of event, persistent \r\navoidance of stimuli associated with event, feelings of \r\ndetachment/estrangement from others, symptoms of increased \r\narousal (difficulty concentrating, irritability, sleep \r\ndisturbance).  \r\n\r\nIn response to the Board's question concerning whether the \r\ndiagnosis of a personality disorder made during active \r\nservice was a correct one, the IME indicated: \"Possibly yes\".  \r\nIt was noted that clearly the veteran had presented a number \r\nof personality disorder traits.  \r\n\r\nIn response to the Board's question concerning what is the \r\nveteran's most likely current diagnosis or diagnoses, the IME \r\nconcluded that on Axis I, the diagnosis is PTSD, based on the \r\nPTSD symptoms reported above and on Axis II, the diagnosis is \r\nCluster C Personality Traits (avoidant, dependent).  \r\n\r\nIn response to whether the veteran currently has an acquired \r\npsychiatric disorder due to his military service, the \r\nspecialist replied: \"Possibly yes\".  The IME continued that \r\nthe PTSD symptoms seem to be related to a traumatic event \r\nduring service.  Also, the veteran's personality disorder \r\ntraits may have made him more vulnerable to the traumatic \r\nevent.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran and his representative received copies of Dr. \r\nJ.E.'s opinion.  In March 2002, the veteran's representative \r\nmade written arguments in support of the claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD, especially noting Dr. J.E.'s comment \r\nthat the PTSD symptoms seem to be related to a traumatic \r\nevent during service.  \r\n  \r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nInitial matter -  VA's duty to notify/assist\r\n\r\nThe Board has given consideration to the provisions of the \r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. \r\n106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000) [codified as amended at \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5100 et seq. (West 2001)].  The VCAA includes \r\nan enhanced duty to notify a claimant as to the information \r\nand evidence necessary to substantiate a claim for VA \r\nbenefits.  This law also redefines the obligations of VA with \r\nrespect to the duty to assist.   Regulations implementing the \r\nVCAA have been enacted.  See 66 Fed. Reg. 45, 620 (August 29, \r\n2001) [codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), \r\n3.159 and 3.326(a)].\r\n\r\nThe VCAA is applicable to all claims filed on or after the \r\ndate of enactment, November 9, 2000, or filed before the date \r\nof enactment and not yet final as of that date.  Except for \r\nprovisions pertaining to claims to reopen based upon the \r\nsubmission of new and material evidence, which are not \r\napplicable in the instant case, the implementing regulations \r\nare also effective November 9, 2000.  In this case, the \r\nregulations are accordingly applicable.  See Holliday v. \r\nPrincipi, 14 Vet. App. 280 (2001) [the Board must make a \r\ndetermination as to the applicability of the various \r\nprovisions of the VCAA to a particular claim].\r\n\r\nAfter having carefully reviewed the record on appeal, and for \r\nreasons expressed immediately below, the Board has concluded \r\nthat the requirements of the VCAA have been effectively \r\nsatisfied with respect to the issue on appeal.  \r\n\r\n\r\n(i.)  Notification\r\n\r\nThe VCAA requires VA to notify the claimant and the \r\nclaimant's representative, if any, of any information, and \r\nany medical or lay evidence not previously provided to VA \r\nthat is necessary to substantiate the claim.  As part of the \r\nnotice, VA is to specifically inform the claimant and the \r\nclaimant's representative, if any, of which portion, if any, \r\nof the evidence is to be provided by the claimant and which \r\npart, if any, VA will attempt to obtain on behalf of the \r\nclaimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103 (West Supp. 2001).  \r\n\r\nIn this case, the veteran has been notified of the pertinent \r\nlaw and of what evidence is needed to warrant a favorable \r\ndecision on a number of occasions over the years.  The \r\nveteran has displayed complete understanding of the VA claims \r\nprocess on the basis of his detailed letters written to the \r\nRO and the Board regarding the claims process through the \r\nyears, culminating in his letter to the President of the \r\nUnited States in July 2001.  The Board concludes, based on \r\nthis history, that the provisions of the VCAA pertaining to \r\nnotification of the veteran have been specifically and fully \r\ncomplied with.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to VA's statutory duty to assist the veteran on \r\nthe development of his claim, the veteran has been given \r\nample opportunity to present evidence and argument in support \r\nof his claim, and he has in fact done so.  On the basis of \r\nreview of the claims folder, there is no indication that the \r\nveteran has further evidence or argument to submit.  The \r\nveteran and his representative have not pointed to any \r\nadditional pertinent evidence which has not been obtained, \r\nand the Board is not aware of any such evidence.\r\n\r\nThe VCAA provides that the assistance provided by VA shall \r\ninclude providing a medical examination or obtaining a \r\nmedical opinion when such an examination or opinion is \r\nnecessary to make a decision on the claim.  An examination is \r\ndeemed \"necessary\" if the evidence of record (lay or medical) \r\ndoes not contain sufficient medical evidence for VA to make a \r\ndecision on the claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A (West Supp. \r\n2001); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159 (2001).  \r\n\r\nThe veteran has been examined on numerous occasions with \r\ndetailed commentary provided by clinicians both VA and \r\nprivate.  As noted above, this case was remanded by the Board \r\nin June 1998 for the specific purpose of obtaining the report \r\nof a psychiatric examination.  This was accomplished.  Most \r\nrecently, in January 2002 the Board obtained the opinion of \r\nan IME.  \r\n\r\nIn summary, the Board believes that all actions required by \r\nthe VCAA have been undertaken and completed, and the veteran \r\ndoes not appear to contend otherwise.  Accordingly, the Board \r\nwill proceed to a decision on the merits.  \r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nThe veteran is seeking service connection for an acquired \r\npsychiatric disorder, specifically PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe medical history pertaining to this case, which has been \r\nreported in some detail above, is long and complex.  In \r\nshort, there were psychiatric problems manifested during the \r\nveteran's service and afterwards.  There have been a variety \r\nof psychiatric diagnoses rendered over the years.  The record \r\nis replete with diagnoses of a personality disorder, \r\nincluding during service.  As noted by the Board, service \r\nconnection may not be granted for personality disorders.  See \r\n38 C.F.R. �� 3.303(c), 4.9, 4.127 (2001).  \r\n\r\nThe primary contention advanced by and on behalf of the \r\nveteran is that he has PTSD related to an incident in service \r\nwhen his weapon discharged accidentally.  That event is \r\ncorroborated by the service records.  However, as the medical \r\nhistory makes clear, there was some question concerning the \r\nvalidity of diagnoses of PTSD because there were many reports \r\nthat the veteran had other problems uppermost in his mind \r\nabove and beyond the shooting incident in service.  \r\n\r\nThe clinical evidence of record was suggestive to the Board \r\nthat the veteran might currently have PTSD in addition to a \r\npersonality disorder.  To clarify the matter, in January 2002 \r\nthis case was referred to an IME for review and an opinion.   \r\nThe IME's response has been detailed above.  In essence, the \r\nIME indicated that the veteran had PTSD which was related to \r\nthe shooting incident during service.  The IME in essence \r\nindicated that the veteran's personality disorder contributed \r\nto his PTSD in that the personality disorder traits may have \r\nmade him more vulnerable to the traumatic event.  \r\n\r\nFor a grant of service connection for PTSD, the governing \r\nregulation, 38 C.F.R. 3.304(f) (2001), requires the presence \r\nof three elements: (1) A current medical diagnosis of PTSD; \r\n(2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service \r\nstressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a \r\ncausal nexus between current symptomatology and the specific \r\nclaimed in-service stressor.  See Cohen, 10 Vet. App. at 138.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to element (1), a current medical diagnosis of \r\nPTSD, although there are other psychiatric diagnoses of \r\nrecord, the most common recent diagnosis, in addition to \r\npersonality disorder, appears to be PTSD.  Accordingly, the \r\nfirst element of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) is established.\r\n\r\nWith respect to element (2), an in-service stressor, the \r\nBoard is required to \"make specific findings of fact as to \r\nwhether or not the veteran was engaged in combat with the \r\nenemy and, if so, whether the claimed stressor is related to \r\nsuch combat.\"  See Zarycki, 6 Vet. App. at 98; see also 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d) (2001).  \r\nClearly, the veteran served during peacetime and was not \r\nengaged in combat, and he does not so contend.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the service administrative records serve to support \r\nthe occurrence of the shooting incident and related events \r\nduring service which the veteran claims caused his PTSD.  \r\nThus, the second element in a claim for PTSD is met.  \r\n\r\nWith regard to element (3), nexus, the IME and a number of \r\nother psychiatric examiners have associated the diagnosis of \r\nPTSD to the accidental discharge of a weapon by the veteran \r\nin service.  Thus, the Board finds that all three elements of \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) have been satisfied.  The veteran has \r\nsubmitted competent evidence of a current diagnosis of PTSD; \r\ncredible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service \r\nstressor actually occurred; and medical evidence of a causal \r\nnexus between current symptomatology and the specific claimed \r\nin-service stressor.   \r\n\r\nAfter having considered the entire record in this case, the \r\nBoard concludes that service connection is in order for an \r\nacquired psychiatric disability, specifically  PTSD.  The \r\nBoard bases its conclusion on the medical evidence of record, \r\nin particular the IME opinion, which is obviously grounded in \r\na thorough review of the veteran's complex medical history.  \r\nAlthough the Board is aware that there are  diagnoses of \r\nother acquired psychiatric disabilities, including dysthymic \r\ndisorder, of record, the weight of the evidence points to \r\nPTSD as the current diagnosis.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the medical evidence, summarized above, \r\nunquestionably establishes veteran had a personality disorder \r\nduring service and still does, the evidence reflects that he \r\ndeveloped PTSD due to his service.  The fact that the veteran \r\nmay have been predisposed to PTSD because of his personality \r\ndisorder, as noted by IME, does not preclude a grant of \r\nservice connection for PTSD based on the facts of this case.  \r\n\r\nThe Board reiterates that service connection may not be \r\ngranted for personality disorders; compensation is not in \r\norder for any pathology which is not attributed to PTSD.    \r\n\r\nIn summary, for the reasons and bases expressed above, the \r\nBoard concludes that the weight of competent and credible \r\nevidence supports a grant of service connection for PTSD.  \r\nThus, the benefit sought on appeal is granted.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tBarry F.

C. Mackenzie, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from February 1976 to \r\nJanuary 1978.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a December 1990 rating decision issued \r\nby the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office \r\n(RO) in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe veteran's claim was initially denied by the Board in \r\nJanuary 1995.  The veteran appealed this denial to the United \r\nStates Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), and, in \r\nAugust 1996, the Court granted a joint motion of the veteran \r\nand the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Secretary) to vacate \r\nthe January 1995 decision and remand the case back to the \r\nBoard.  \r\n\r\nSubsequently, following remands to the RO for further \r\ndevelopment in April 1997 and August 1998, the Board again \r\ndenied the claim of entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD in a January 2001 decision.  In a September 2001 joint \r\nmotion, the veteran and the Secretary argued that the January \r\n2001 decision should be vacated on account of inadequate \r\nreasons and bases; specifically, the provisions of \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103 (West 1991 & Supp. 2001) were described as \r\nnot having been adequately discussed by the Board.  The Court \r\ngranted this motion in the same month, and the case is again \r\nbefore the Board.\r\n\r\nThe issue of entitlement to TDIU was also subject to the \r\nSeptember 2001 Court order, but the Board has determined that \r\nadditional development is needed in regard to this issue.  \r\nThis development will be accomplished by the Board in \r\naccordance with the revised provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 19.9, \r\nand the issue of entitlement to TDIU will be addressed in a \r\nseparate, forthcoming Board decision.  See 67 Fed. Reg. 3099, \r\n3104 (Jan. 23, 2002) (to be codified at 38 C.F.R. � 19.9). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  All relevant evidence necessary to render a decision on \r\nthe veteran's claim has been obtained by the RO, and the RO \r\nhas notified him of the type of evidence needed to \r\nsubstantiate his claim.\r\n\r\n2.  The veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD is not predicated \r\nupon a verified in-service stressor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for entitlement to service connection for PTSD \r\nhave not been met.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131, 1154, 5103, 5103A, \r\n5107 (West 1991 & Supp. 2001); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304 \r\n(2001); 66 Fed. Reg. 45630-45632 (Aug. 29, 2001) (to be \r\ncodified as amended at 38 C.F.R. � 3.159).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nInitially, the Board finds that all relevant facts have been \r\nproperly developed in regard to the veteran's claim, and no \r\nfurther assistance is required in order to comply with the \r\nVA's statutory duty to assist him with the development of \r\nfacts pertinent to his claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A (West \r\nSupp. 2001); 66 Fed. Reg. 45630-45632 (Aug. 29, 2001) (to be \r\ncodified as amended at 38 C.F.R. � 3.159).  Specifically, the \r\nRO has afforded the veteran multiple VA examinations in \r\nconjunction with his claim and has obtained records of \r\nreported treatment.  Moreover, as described in further detail \r\nbelow, the RO has made all necessary efforts to verify the \r\nveteran's claimed in-service PTSD stressors.\r\n\r\nThe VA's duty to notify the veteran of the evidence necessary \r\nto substantiate his claim has also been met, as the RO \r\ninformed him of the need for such evidence in the April 1991 \r\nStatement of the Case.  Specifically, the RO informed the \r\nveteran that, for his claim to be granted, there would have \r\nto be evidence of PTSD based on a verified in-service \r\nstressor.  The RO has further informed the veteran of the \r\nneed for such evidence in several subsequent Supplemental \r\nStatements of the Case.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103 (West 1991 & \r\nSupp. 2001). \r\n\r\nGiven that the actions by the RO reflect fundamental \r\ncompliance with the newly enacted provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n�� 5103 and 5103A, the Board finds that the veteran's appeal \r\nwill not be adversely affected merely because the RO \r\ndeveloped this appeal prior to, and did not inform him of, \r\nthe enactment of the new provisions. See Bernard v. Brown, 4 \r\nVet. App. 384, 394 (1993); see also Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. \r\nApp. 426, 430 (1994) (remands which would only result in \r\nunnecessarily imposing additional burdens on the VA with no \r\nbenefit flowing to the veteran are to be avoided).\r\n\r\nGenerally, in order to establish service connection for a \r\nparticular disorder, the evidence of record must demonstrate \r\nthat a disease or injury resulting in a current disability \r\nwas incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1131 (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (2001).  \r\nHowever, VA regulations reflect that symptoms attributable to \r\nPTSD are often not manifested in service.  Accordingly, \r\nservice connection for PTSD requires a current medical \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD (presumed to include the adequacy of the \r\nPTSD symptomatology and the sufficiency of a claimed in-\r\nservice stressor), credible supporting evidence that the \r\nclaimed in-service stressor(s) actually occurred, and medical \r\nevidence of a causal relationship between current \r\nsymptomatology and the specific claimed in-service \r\nstressor(s).  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2001); Cohen v. \r\nBrown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 138 (1997) (citing Moreau v. Brown, \r\n9 Vet. App. 389, 394-95 (1996)).\r\n\r\nThe evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a \r\nstressor during service to support a claim for PTSD will vary \r\ndepending on whether the veteran was \"engaged in combat with \r\nthe enemy.\"  See Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 66 (1993).  \r\nIf the evidence establishes that the veteran was engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy or was a prisoner of war (POW), and the \r\nclaimed stressor is related to combat or POW experiences (in \r\nthe absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, \r\nand provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the \r\ncircumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's \r\nservice), the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the \r\noccurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  \r\n\r\nWhere, however, the VA determines that the veteran did not \r\nengage in combat with the enemy and was not a POW, or the \r\nclaimed stressor is not related to combat or POW experiences, \r\nthe veteran's lay statements, by themselves, will not be \r\nenough to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.  \r\nInstead, the record must contain service records or other \r\ncredible evidence corroborating the stressor.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 1154(b) (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d), (f) (2001); \r\nGaines v. West, 11 Vet. App. 353, 357-58 (1998).  Such \r\ncorroborating evidence cannot consist solely of after-the-\r\nfact medical evidence containing an opinion as to a causal \r\nrelationship between PTSD and service.  See Moreau v. Brown, \r\n9 Vet. App. 389, 396 (1996).\r\n\r\nThe Board has first considered the question of whether the \r\nveteran has a medical diagnosis of PTSD.  In this case, the \r\nveteran's current PTSD is confirmed by the evidence of \r\nrecord.  VA examination reports from March 1992 and January \r\n1998 contain a diagnosis of PTSD.  The Board also finds no \r\nother evidence that calls this diagnosis into serious \r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the veteran's diagnosis of PTSD must be based \r\nupon either participation in combat with the enemy or a \r\nverified in-service stressor for service connection to be \r\nwarranted, as noted above.  Again, a favorable medical \r\nopinion is insufficient, in and of itself, to predicate the \r\ngrant of service connection for PTSD.  See Moreau v. Brown, 9 \r\nVet. App. at 396.  Thus, the question becomes whether the \r\nveteran either engaged in combat with the enemy during \r\nservice or experienced a verified in-service stressor upon \r\nwhich the diagnosis of PTSD is predicated.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the question of whether the veteran \r\nparticipated in combat with the enemy during service, the \r\nBoard observes that he did not have service during a period \r\nof war and was not stationed overseas at any time during \r\nservice.  Moreover, the veteran has not in any way alleged \r\nthat he participated in combat during his military service.\r\n\r\nAs such, the question becomes whether the veteran experienced \r\na verifiable in-service stressor, upon which the current \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD is predicated.  In this regard, the veteran \r\nhas reported that he was severely beaten during boot camp, \r\nthat he feared being beaten to death because of rumors that \r\nthis had happened to a prior recruit, and that he was afraid \r\nof being killed because of the shooting of live ammunition \r\nduring \"motivation\" training. \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the veteran's service medical records \r\nare entirely negative for documentation of his claimed \r\nstressors.  While the veteran was treated for right upper \r\nextremity symptomatology during service, this was attributed \r\nto sports injuries at the time of treatment.\r\n\r\nIt is acknowledged that the veteran was most likely utilizing \r\nlive ammunition at some point during his training regimen, \r\nalthough documenting a subjective reaction to this activity \r\nthat would be emotionally disproportionate would seem to be \r\nthe evidentiary question presented with regard to this aspect \r\nof the stressor situation being considered.  While the \r\nveteran also contended that he was subjected to live \r\nammunition fire during training exercises having a punitive \r\npurpose, this assertion would, quite simply, require some \r\nform of corroboration, which has not been forthcoming.\r\n\r\nIn a September 1998 letter, the RO requested that the veteran \r\nprovide additional details about his claimed stressors, \r\nspecifically to include the names of other individuals who \r\ncould corroborate these stressors.  In October 1998, the \r\nveteran's former representative responded that he was unable \r\nto remember the names of other individuals with knowledge of \r\nthe reported stressors.  The veteran also was unable to \r\nprovide names of in-service treatment providers, as requested \r\nby the RO.  A request for further information in this regard \r\nfrom the headquarters of the United States Marine Corps of \r\nthe Department of the Navy resulted in a negative response in \r\nOctober 1999.  \r\n\r\nIn a March 2000 lay submission, the veteran provided \r\nadditional information, including the names of several other \r\ncommanders and instructors.  The RO contacted the United \r\nStates Marine Corps headquarters in the same month, but, in \r\nan April 2000 response, the United States Marine Corps \r\nheadquarters again indicated that the veteran's \"anecdotal \r\nincidents\" could not be verified.  The RO subsequently \r\nobtained the veteran's personnel file, but this file also \r\ncontains no documentation relevant to his reported stressors. \r\n\r\nIn April 2002, the Board received additional statements from \r\nthe veteran and his attorney, as well as a VA hospital record \r\ndocumenting an admission in July 1982 for alcohol and \r\nsubstance abuse.\r\n\r\nGiven the limited information provided by the veteran and the \r\nRO's attempts to obtain service department information, the \r\nBoard finds that sufficient efforts have been made to verify \r\nhis stressors and that, even though no stressors were \r\nverified, there is no reasonable basis for further stressor \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n\r\nOverall, based upon a review of the entire claims file, the \r\nBoard finds that the evidence of record shows that the \r\nveteran has been diagnosed with PTSD.  However, the evidence \r\nof record does not in any way reflect participation in combat \r\nwith the enemy, and there is no evidence showing that the \r\nveteran's current diagnosis of PTSD is based upon a verified \r\nstressor from service.  As such, the Board finds that the \r\npreponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim \r\nof entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  In reaching \r\nthis decision, the Board acknowledges that the VA is \r\nstatutorily required to resolve the benefit of the doubt in \r\nfavor of the veteran when there is an approximate balance of \r\npositive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an \r\noutstanding issue.  However, that doctrine is not applicable \r\nin this case because the preponderance of the evidence is \r\nagainst the veteran's claim.  See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 \r\nVet.

Osborne, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from March 1964 to March \r\n1968.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal of a March 2002 rating decision issued \r\nby the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office \r\n(RO) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (PA), denying the \r\nveteran's claim of service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe veteran reasonably raised the following issues in a \r\nstatement received by the Board in November 2002: (1) \r\nwhether new and material evidence has been submitted to \r\nreopen his claim for service connection for psychiatric \r\ndisorders, other than PTSD; and (2) entitlement to service \r\nconnection for residuals of exposure to Agent Orange.  \r\nThese matters are referred to the RO for appropriate \r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the evidence is against a finding \r\nthat the veteran suffers from PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPost-traumatic stress disorder was not incurred in or \r\naggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107 (West \r\n1991 & Supp. 2001); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3.304(f) \r\n(2002).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  Veterans Claims Assistance Act\r\n\r\nThe Board observes that recently enacted law (the Veterans \r\nClaims Assistance Act of 2000, hereinafter \"the VCAA\") and \r\nits implementing regulations essentially eliminate the \r\nrequirement that a claimant submit evidence of a well-\r\ngrounded claim.  These regulations provide that VA will \r\nassist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to \r\nsubstantiate a claim but is not required to provide \r\nassistance to a claimant if there is no reasonable \r\npossibility that such assistance would aid in \r\nsubstantiating the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5103A, 5107(a) \r\n(West 1991 & Supp. 2001); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159(c)-\r\n(d)) (2002).\r\n\r\nThe VCAA and its implementing regulations also include new \r\nnotification provisions.  Specifically, they require VA to \r\nnotify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if \r\nany, of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, \r\nnot previously provided to the Secretary, that is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim.  As part of the \r\nnotice, VA is to specifically inform the claimant and the \r\nclaimant's representative, if any, of which portion, if \r\nany, of the evidence is to be provided by the claimant and \r\nwhich part, if any, VA will attempt to obtain on behalf of \r\nthe claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103 (West 1991 & Supp. \r\n2001); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) (2002).\r\n\r\nThe record reflects that VA has made reasonable efforts to \r\nnotify the veteran of the information and medical evidence \r\nnecessary to substantiate his service connection claim for \r\nPTSD.  The veteran was sent a letter by the RO in January \r\n2002 which explained, among other things, the VCAA's duty \r\nto assist and what evidence was needed to substantiate his \r\nservice connection claim for PTSD.  Further, the veteran \r\nwas issued a statement of the case in April 2002.  These \r\ndocuments provided the veteran notice of the law and \r\ngoverning regulations (including the implementing \r\nregulations noted above) as well as the reasons for the \r\ndeterminations made regarding his claim of service \r\nconnection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe record on this claim also shows that VA has made \r\nreasonable efforts to obtain relevant records adequately \r\nidentified by the appellant.  VA has obtained the \r\nveteran's service and VA medical records and private \r\nmedical records from Dr. S.M.C., Pittsburgh, PA. \r\n\r\nThe veteran thus has been advised of the evidence \r\nnecessary to substantiate his claim and evidence relevant \r\nto the claim has been properly developed.  As such, there \r\nis no further action necessary to comply with the \r\nprovisions of the VCAA or its implementing regulations.  \r\nTherefore, the veteran will not be prejudiced as a result \r\nof the Board deciding this claim.\r\n\r\nII.  Service Connection for PTSD\r\n\r\nThe veteran and his representative contend that the \r\nveteran suffers from PTSD as a result of his service in \r\nVietnam.  Initially, a review of the veteran's service \r\nrecords indicates that he served in Vietnam for one year \r\nwhile on active duty and that his military occupational \r\nspecialty was as a combat engineer.\r\n\r\nThe veteran's service medical records indicate that he was \r\nevaluated on one occasion while in service for possible \r\npsychological problems.  In January 1968, the veteran was \r\nseen by the Neuropsychiatric Evaluation Unit, Marine Corps \r\nAir Station, Beaufort, South Carolina.  In the request for \r\npsychiatric evaluation, it was noted that the veteran \r\ncomplained of frequent episodes of strange feelings, \r\nnervousness, and an ability to hear things other people \r\ncould not.  No flight of ideas was evident during the \r\nveteran's psychological interview.  The veteran was \r\nconcrete in his thinking.  The provisional diagnosis was \r\nof rule out psychopathological disorders versus anxiety \r\nreaction.  \r\n\r\nMental status examination of the veteran was accomplished \r\nin January 1968, which revealed a mildly anxious \r\nindividual who was well oriented in all spheres.  There \r\nwas no evidence of gross thought disorder, psychosis, or \r\norganic brain impairment.  At the time of this \r\nexamination, the veteran complained of dizzy spells, \r\noccasional episodes of transient black-outs, and \r\nhypersensitivity to noises around him.  There was no \r\ndepersonalization present although at times the veteran \r\nhad had a numbness of his left arm which had been \r\nexplained by a recent car accident.  The veteran also \r\nclaimed that he was hypersensitive to high sounds which, \r\nin general, did not annoy other people but gave him a \r\nheadache.  Although the veteran's abstracting ability \r\nfirst appeared to be concrete, further questioning \r\nrevealed that it was intact and that he abstracted well \r\nconsidering his cultural and educational background.  The \r\nveteran's background history included some elements of \r\npassive aggressive type development and that he had \r\nconsulted a psychologist while in high school because of \r\nacademic difficulties and hyperventilation episodes.  The \r\nremainder of the veteran's past history was essentially \r\nnon-contributory.  The impression was of situational \r\nanxiety reaction, transient, NCD (not considered \r\ndisabling).\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the service medical records, including \r\nthe February 1968 separation examination report, disclose \r\nno further indications of in-service treatment for \r\npsychological problems.  When the veteran underwent \r\nclinical evaluation in February 1968, for the purpose of \r\nseparation from service, his psychiatric and neurologic \r\nexaminations were normal.\r\n\r\nVA medical records, dated between February 1982 and \r\nSeptember 1982, show that the veteran received treatment \r\nfor complaints which included feelings of anxiety, \r\nfrustration, increased irritability, and emotional \r\ndifficulties.  In May 1982, a VA psychiatric consultation \r\nwas performed.  At that time, the veteran presented with \r\ncomplaints of increased irritability and rage, and \r\ndecreased memory.  It was noted that noted that the \r\nveteran had been laid off as a coal miner, and that he had \r\nbeen seen on two prior occasions with complaints of \r\npsychosomatic and other psychological symptoms.  The \r\nveteran also related complaints of disturbed sleep, late \r\nnight insomnia, lack of energy, easy fatigability, \r\nnightmares, numbness in his face and arms, episodic chest \r\npains, and poor concentration.  The veteran denied \r\nhallucinations, and it was noted that he had no delusional \r\ntendencies.  The veteran's Serial 7's, and his \r\npresidential sequence were good.  His judgment and insight \r\nwere fair.  The impressions include PTSD and depression.\r\n\r\nIn June 1982, when he was seen by VA, he was continued on \r\nmedication for anxiety, noting that the veteran was not \r\ncurrently under a physician's care for that condition.  In \r\nSeptember 1982, the veteran complained to a VA examiner \r\n(who had interviewed him briefly) that the medication \r\nprescribed for his anxiety had not been effective, had \r\ndone nothing for his symptoms, and had made him \"hyper.\"  \r\nIt was noted that the veteran's overall picture was \r\nunclear, and that the veteran was taken off of his \r\nmedications until his diagnosis was clarified.  During \r\nthis session, a psychiatric evaluation to include the \r\nveteran's wife was scheduled in order to obtain a more \r\ndetailed history of the veteran's psychological problems.  \r\nFollowing this evaluation in October 1982, the VA \r\npsychiatrist concluded that, dynamically, the veteran \r\nappeared to be suffering from anaclitic depression \r\nintensified by present factors.\r\n\r\nIn October 1982, the veteran was referred to VA social \r\nwork services for assistance concerning the issue of his \r\nunemployment.  The social worker noted that the veteran \r\nhad been a police officer in Washington, Pennsylvania for \r\n8 years before quitting to continue his education.  When \r\nthe veteran was unable to get GI benefits in order to \r\nattend ministry school, he got a job as a coal miner where \r\nhe worked for 5 years before being laid off by his \r\nemployer.  It was noted that the veteran had been unable \r\nto find regular employment since that time.  \r\n\r\nIn May 1983, the veteran was accorded a VA psychiatric \r\nexamination.  The examiner reported reviewing the \r\nveteran's records, which included the May 1982 \r\nconsultation report that indicate a diagnosis of PTSD, as \r\nwell as the September 1982 follow-up examination which \r\nindicated that the veteran's diagnosis was unclear.  The \r\nexaminer also noted the differing psychiatric diagnoses \r\nindicated after the veteran's previous examinations.  Upon \r\nmental status examination, the veteran indicated that, in \r\nVietnam, he was a combat engineer and was in the infantry.  \r\nThe veteran did not describe any particular flashbacks, \r\nbut related that he did have occasional nightmares.  He \r\ndescribed some loss of interest and some sense of being a \r\nfailure.  He did not describe clear fears, but did \r\nindicate that everybody had fears.  There was no obvious \r\nevidence of delusions or hallucinations.  The resulting \r\ndiagnosis was of depression, neurotic type, mild to \r\nmoderate severity, manifested by what appeared to be some \r\nfeelings of depression.  The examiner also commented that \r\nit was quite possible that the veteran's sensations of \r\nnumbness had a psychological basis and might be related to \r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nA review of Social Security Administration records \r\nprovided by the veteran reflects that the veteran received \r\nan OHA Psychiatric Review, the results of which were \r\ncontained in an OHA Psychiatric Review Technique Form and \r\nsigned by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in May 1998.  \r\nIt was found that the veteran presented with symptoms of \r\naffective disorders, specifically a mood disorder.  \r\nExamination of the veteran revealed that he had become an \r\nirritable and angry person who must change positions \r\nfrequently.  A consulting psychologist also noted that the \r\nveteran suffered from a mood disorder with some impaired \r\nconcentration and accompanying fatigue and despair \r\ncentered around his pain problem.  The ALJ also concluded, \r\nin a May 1998 decision, that the medical evidence \r\nestablished that the veteran had mood disorder which, in \r\npart, rendered the veteran unable to perform his past \r\nrelevant employment.\r\n\r\nIn a psychosocial evaluation of the veteran accomplished \r\nat VAMC Pittsburgh on May 1, 2001, the veteran recalled \r\nthat he had served near Qui Nhon, Chu Lai, Phu Bai, and \r\nQuan Tre near the demilitarized zone (DMZ) in Vietnam.  He \r\ndenied any thoughts of harming himself and stated that he \r\nhad no plans to harm himself or anyone else.  The \r\ndiagnosis was rule out PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn an initial evaluation of the veteran for the VAMC \r\nPittsburgh PTSD Team accomplished at VAMC Pittsburgh on \r\nMay 9, 2001, the veteran stated that the locations where \r\nhe served in Vietnam were Qui Nhon, Chu Lai, and Phu Bai.  \r\nHe described his combat area of duty as mainly combat and \r\ncombat support.  The veteran related that he served one \r\ntour of duty in a combat zone in Vietnam.  In describing \r\nhis tour of duty, the veteran stated that he had served as \r\na combat engineer in combat areas with various units in \r\nVietnam.  When asked if he had been wounded or \r\nhospitalized, the veteran stated that his right arm had \r\nbeen hit and that he had to have medical attention in the \r\nfield hospital.  He stated further that they were under \r\nfire, and he leaped for cover and hit a wire camouflaging \r\nand cut his chest.  The veteran recounted that he was \r\ngoing to be evacuated by helicopter but that he asked for \r\nand received treatment in the field.  The veteran also \r\ndescribed his exposure to combat as flying in an aircraft \r\nover a combat zone.  He recalled that he had been with \r\nunits in Vietnam receiving incoming fire rockets, \r\nartillery, and mortars.  The veteran recalled further that \r\nhe had encountered mines and booby traps in the field, his \r\nunits had received sniper fire, his unit patrol had been \r\nambushed and had engaged the enemy troops in fire fights, \r\nthat he saw American allies wounded and enemies killed, \r\nand that he saw many wounded.\r\n\r\nThe veteran also recounted two incidents of combat during \r\nthe May 9, 2001 session.  With the first incident, the \r\nveteran recalled that his unit had been on a mission in a \r\nhelicopter when it was hit by enemy fire.  They had to \r\njump out of the helicopter and were unable to make it to \r\nthe landing zone.  The veteran stated that, after they \r\nwere on the ground, a plane fired on them.  He was first \r\nin line and the plane came again to fire on them.  The \r\nenemy was running from American Allied troops during this \r\nincident.  Just about when the plane was in position to \r\nfire on them again, according to the veteran, a Green \r\nBeret with a radio contacted someone and got the plane off \r\nof them.  During this engagement, the veteran recalled \r\nlater that he was very scared, that he knew it was over, \r\nand that he hoped that he was ready to die.  \r\n\r\nIn the second incident, the veteran recalled that he had \r\nbeen on a mission with a reconnaissance squad near the \r\nDMZ.  The veteran said that, when they lifted off in \r\nhelicopters and were in the air, they could see the DMZ \r\nand the fighting going on there.  After being escorted for \r\na good while by four jet fighters, a \"sky-hop\" dropped \r\nnapalm and left, leaving the helicopter unable to land, \r\nand they were out at sea.  Once out at sea, they had to \r\njump out of the helicopter and their gear was thrown out \r\nof the helicopter as well.  The veteran recalled that this \r\nmission had been restarted, and he was told that their \r\nmission was building a helicopter pad and bunker.  They \r\nstarted blasting down trees and clearing out an area to \r\nmake a helicopter loading zone, and that night the veteran \r\nasked where they were but was not told.  The veteran \r\nfurther recalled being attacked at this base with enemy \r\ngrenades and missiles coming in for several hours.\r\n\r\nAfter evaluating the veteran and considering his military, \r\nas described during the May 9, 2001 initial evaluation, \r\nthe resulting diagnosis was rule out PTSD and rule out \r\nmood disorder.\r\n\r\nThe veteran was seen by a VA psychiatrist for a course of \r\noutpatient individual therapy beginning on June 28, 2001 \r\nand continuing through September 2001.  The psychiatrist, \r\nwho first saw the veteran for individual therapy on June \r\n28, 2001, reviewed the veteran's other medical records \r\nprior to evaluating him.  The psychiatrist noted that \r\nveteran's medical history included a mood disorder \r\nsecondary to his physical problems.  Following psychiatric \r\nevaluation at that time, the psychiatrist diagnosed the \r\nveteran with a mood disorder, not otherwise specified, but \r\ncould not confirm PTSD.  When the veteran was seen during \r\nthe course of subsequent outpatient individual therapy, \r\nthe examiner's diagnostic impressions of the veteran on \r\nJuly 30, 2001, were mood disorder, not otherwise specific, \r\nrule out major depression, and PTSD by history.  On August \r\n29, 2001, the examiner's diagnostic impression of the \r\nveteran was major depression.  Finally, the diagnostic \r\nimpression of the veteran on September 26, 2001, was major \r\ndepression, moderate.\r\n\r\nIn November 2001, the veteran submitted information to the \r\nRO describing in-service stressors.  The veteran recalled \r\nthat he was in a helicopter going to a landing zone when \r\nit was hit and he had to jump out in to the middle of an \r\noperation taking place.  The veteran also recalled that he \r\nhad been on a volunteer mission to make a landing zone and \r\nbunker to watch enemy movement on the Ho Chi Minh Trail \r\nroute.  While on this mission, his unit was hit on the \r\nsecond day out and no one was able to get them out.  The \r\nveteran stated that, while they waited to be extracted, \r\nhis unit was on full alert until the third day and had to \r\nfight the enemy until that time. Finally, the veteran \r\nrecalled that he and 2 Green Berets were on a special \r\ndemolition team in the first incident and on the second \r\nincident he was in force reconnaissance squad 6 demolition \r\nteam. \r\n\r\nVA conducted a PTSD examination of the veteran in January \r\n2002.  As for his medical history, it was noted that the \r\nveteran was seen for psychological complaints while in \r\nservice in 1968, and after separation from service.  The \r\nveteran stated he had been treated for complaints of \r\nvoices in his head as well as multiple physical symptoms \r\nincluding numbness in his arms and confusion.  The veteran \r\nreported that he continued to have episodes of anxiety and \r\ndepression over the years.  The veteran's May 2001 initial \r\nevaluation was noted, along with the fact that a diagnosis \r\nof PTSD was not made at that time or in June 2001.  It was \r\nalso noted that the veteran's psychiatric history \r\nindicated that the veteran's diagnosis consistently had \r\nbeen that of the major depressive disorder with GAF scores \r\nin the 50's and 60's since he had started seeing his \r\npsychiatrist, Dr. A., on a regular basis, and that PTSD \r\nhad never been mentioned.\r\n\r\nDuring the VA examination in January 2002, the examiner \r\nnoted that the veteran was unable to recall exactly when \r\nhe served in Vietnam and how long he was there and that he \r\n(the examiner) found this extremely unusual.  The veteran \r\ncould not be specific about where he had been stationed in \r\nVietnam, although he mentioned a number of localities like \r\nPhu-Bai, Chu-Lai, and Qui-Nhon.  The veteran identified \r\nhis unit and reported that his unit was a support unit for \r\nwhat he felt were infantry units.  In this regard, the \r\nveteran stated that he was responsible for the demolition \r\nof tunnels and also for disarming mines, bombs, and \r\nmortars.  The veteran recalled being ambushed once when on \r\na volunteer mission to make a new landing zone, and also \r\nbeing hit with casualties in his unit.  He was unable to \r\nrecall when this last incident occurred, where it was, or \r\nwho had been injured or killed as a result.  In addition, \r\nthe veteran related that he was exposed to the dangers of \r\nbooby traps, mines, rocket, and mortar attacks.  Following \r\nthe mental status examination, the veteran was found to be \r\nsuffering from a primary thought process disorder that had \r\nmajor affect of aspects to it and would appear to have \r\nbeen suffering from this condition for many, many years, \r\nthough the veteran evidently was functional to some degree \r\nor another over the course of time.  The overall clinical \r\nimpression was of a schizo-affective disorder.  The VA \r\nexaminer explained that while the veteran was not \r\ncompletely illogical, nonsensical, or bizarre, such that \r\nthe cognitive aspects were not as obvious as were the \r\naffective ones, they were nonetheless present.\r\n\r\nBased on a review of the veteran's medical records, \r\nincluding his claims folder, as well as the results of his \r\nearlier psychological evaluations, and assuming that the \r\ninformation gathered was factual and accurate, the VA \r\nexaminer in January 2002 opined that the veteran suffered \r\nfrom schizo-affective disorder, chronic, in only partial \r\nremission.  The veteran's major stressors were his \r\npsychiatric symptoms, his multiple medical problems, a \r\npsychologically-influenced chronic pain syndrome, and the \r\neffects of all of these on various aspects of the \r\nveteran's life.  In the summary and conclusion, the VA \r\nexaminer concluded that the veteran did not meet the \r\ndiagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of PTSD in either \r\nterms of identified stressors or any ongoing symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe veteran received another course of outpatient \r\nindividual therapy between November 2001 and February 2002 \r\nat VAMC Pittsburgh.  The VA examiner's diagnostic \r\nimpression of the veteran after individual therapy on \r\nNovember 21, 2001, as well as in January and February \r\n2002, was of major depression.\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury that was incurred in or aggravated \r\nby active service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 1991 & Supp. \r\n2001); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (2002).  A chronic disease will \r\nbe considered to have been incurred in service when \r\nmanifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within 1 year \r\nfrom the date of separation from active service.  See \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.307 (2002).  A psychosis shall be considered \r\na chronic disease within the meaning of 38 C.F.R. � 3.307.  \r\nSee 38 C.F.R. � 3.309 (2002).\r\n\r\nIn addition, service connection for PTSD requires: (1) \r\nmedical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance \r\nwith 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) (2002); (2) a link, established \r\nby medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-\r\nservice stressor; and (3) credible supporting evidence \r\nthat the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  If the \r\nevidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat \r\nwith the enemy, and the claimed stressor is related to \r\nthat combat, his lay testimony-alone-may establish the \r\noccurrence of the claimed in-service stressor in the \r\nabsence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, \r\nand provided that the claimed in-service stressor is \r\nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions, or \r\nhardships of his service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2002).  \r\nSee  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet.App. 128 (1997).\r\n\r\nTaking into account all of the evidence listed above, the \r\nBoard finds that the preponderance of the evidence is \r\nagainst the veteran's claim of service connection for \r\nPTSD.  As noted above, the veteran's service medical \r\nrecords indicate treatment for a single incident of \r\ntransient, non-disabling situational anxiety reaction \r\nwhile in service.  There is no evidence of any psychiatric \r\ndiagnosis at the date of the veteran's discharge or within \r\n1 year of the veteran's discharge.  Further, there is no \r\nevidence of a probative PTSD diagnosis following the \r\nveteran's discharge that might support the veteran's \r\nclaim.  \r\n\r\nThe first diagnosis of PTSD was documented in the \r\nveteran's VA medical records in May 1982, more than 14 \r\nyears after he was separated from service.  However, \r\nsubsequent mental health professions were unable to agree \r\non a definitive diagnosis for the veteran's psychological \r\nproblems.  Most of the psychiatrists who examined the \r\nveteran diagnosed a psychological condition other than \r\nPTSD.  As noted above, the VA examiner stated in September \r\n1982 that the veteran's overall diagnostic picture was \r\nunclear.  After psychiatric evaluation of the veteran in \r\nOctober 1982, the VA examiner diagnosed the veteran with \r\ndepression intensified by problems present in his life.  \r\nThe VA examiner in May 1983, who reviewed the veteran's \r\nservice medical records and his earlier psychiatric \r\nevaluation reports, including the report of May 1982, \r\ndiagnosed the veteran with depression and also stated that \r\nit appeared quite possible that numbness experienced by \r\nthe veteran since separation from service had a \r\npsychological basis that might be related to anxiety.  \r\nIndeed, no diagnosis of PTSD was reported on that formal \r\nevaluation.  Moreover, in the SSA psychiatric review \r\ncompleted in May 1998, the ALJ concluded that the medical \r\nevidence demonstrated that the veteran suffered from a \r\nmood disorder with impaired concentration and some \r\nfatigue.  The consistent diagnosis of the veteran during \r\nevaluations accomplished in May 2001 was rule out PTSD, \r\nmeaning that the VA examiners who saw the veteran at this \r\ntime were unable to diagnose PTSD.  The diagnostic \r\nimpressions of the veteran's psychiatric problems during \r\noutpatient psychiatric therapy between July and September \r\n2001 and between November 2001 and February 2002 also were \r\ninconclusive for PTSD, and pointed to other psychological \r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nAlthough the veteran was diagnosed with PTSD by history in \r\nJuly 2001, this diagnosis was based entirely on the \r\nveteran's subjective reported psychiatric history.  The VA \r\nexaminer who diagnosed the veteran with PTSD by history \r\nmade no reference to the diagnostic criteria for PTSD \r\nfound in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \r\nDisorders, Fourth Edition (or DSM-IV).  Further, this \r\nexaminer failed to provide any specific medical evidence \r\nlinking the veteran's reported psychological problems to \r\nthe PTSD diagnosis.  More importantly, however, the VA \r\nexaminer who evaluated the veteran for PTSD in January \r\n2002 specifically concluded that the veteran did not meet \r\nthe diagnostic criteria for PTSD found in the DSM-IV \r\neither in terms of any identified stressors or in terms of \r\nany ongoing psychological symptoms.  The cumulative effect \r\nof this medical evidence (i.e., the various diagnoses of \r\nthe veteran's psychiatric problems issued by VA examiners \r\nwho treated the veteran's psychological problems since his \r\nseparation from service) demonstrates, at best, that the \r\nveteran suffers from a psychological condition other than \r\nPTSD.  Thus, it is significant that the VA examiners who \r\ntreated the veteran for psychological problems considered \r\nhis reported military history, including his alleged in-\r\nservice stressors, in diagnosing the veteran with \r\npsychological conditions other than PTSD.  \r\n\r\nTo the extent that the veteran claims that he suffers from \r\nPTSD as a result of his in-service experiences, it is \r\npointed out that, as a layman without proper medical \r\ntraining and expertise, the veteran is not competent to \r\nprovide probative medical evidence on a matter such as the \r\ndiagnosis or etiology of a claimed medical condition.  See \r\nEspiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet.App. 492, 494-5 (1992).  \r\nTherefore, as with the veteran's assertions regarding his \r\nalleged in-service stressors, the Board also cannot assign \r\nany weight to the veteran's lay assertions of PTSD.  \r\n\r\nGiven the foregoing, the Board finds that the \r\npreponderance of the evidence is against a diagnosis of \r\nPTSD in this case.  See, e.g., Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. \r\nApp. at 153 (Chief Nebeker, concurring) (VA adjudicators \r\nmay reject the claim upon a finding that a preponderance \r\nof the evidence is against a PTSD diagnosis).  Thus, the \r\nreasonable doubt doctrine is not applicable in this case \r\nas the evidence is not evenly balanced.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5107(b) (West 1991 & Supp. 2001); see also Gilbert v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet.App. 49, 58 (1991).  The Board also notes \r\nthat further assistance to the veteran in developing this \r\nclaim is not warranted, as there is no reasonable \r\npossibility that such assistance would aid in \r\nsubstantiating the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5103A, 5107(a) \r\n(West 1991 & Supp. 2001).  Therefore, the Board concludes \r\nthat PTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by service.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for post-traumatic \r\nstress disorder is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tDEBORAH W.

O'Shay, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active military service from November 1965 to \r\nNovember 1968.\r\n\r\nIn October 1997, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\ndetermined that a March 1994 rating decision by the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in \r\nWinston-Salem, North Carolina (RO), which in pertinent part \r\ndenied entitlement to service connection for PTSD, was final, \r\nand that the issue before the Board was whether new and \r\nmaterial evidence had been submitted to reopen the claim for \r\nservice connection for PTSD; the Board remanded the case for \r\nfurther procedural development.\r\n\r\nThe Board again remanded the case in February 1998.  \r\nThereafter, in May 2000 the Board determined that new and \r\nmaterial evidence had been submitted to reopen the claim for \r\nservice connection for PTSD, and remanded the case for \r\nfurther development; the case was returned to the Board in \r\nMarch 2002.\r\n\r\nIn June 2002, the Board undertook additional development with \r\nrespect to the issue on appeal pursuant to authority granted \r\nby 67 Fed. Reg. 3099, 3104 (Jan. 23, 2002) (codified at 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 19.9(a)(2) (2002)).  The development actions \r\nrequested by the Board have been completed and the case is \r\nnow ready for adjudication.  The Board notes that the \r\nreferenced development actions resulted in the acquisition of \r\nan October 2002 statement by the United States Marine Corps \r\n(with attachment) and the report of a January 2003 VA \r\nexamination.  The veteran has not had the opportunity to \r\nreview either addition to the record pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 20.903(b) (2002).  Nevertheless, in light of the \r\ndisposition of the case below, the Board finds that the \r\nveteran will not be prejudiced as a result of the Board \r\nproceeding to the merits of his claim at this time.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe veteran has PTSD which originated in service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe veteran has PTSD which was incurred as the result of his \r\nmilitary service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.303, 3.304(f) (2002).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that he has PTSD which originated from \r\nseveral stressors in service.  His claimed stressors include, \r\nbut are not limited to, physical and verbal harassment \r\nexperienced while in a weight-control program in basic \r\ntraining; experiencing enemy fire while maintaining, \r\nrebuilding and guarding bridges and roads in Vietnam; \r\nexperiencing sniper fire while operating a ferry site, as \r\nwell as enemy fire while defending his base camp in Vietnam; \r\nbecoming a prisoner of war; witnessing the death of American \r\nsoldiers in landmine explosions; driving in convoys in which \r\nlandmines were struck, and engaging in over 50 combat \r\nmissions. \r\n\r\nFactual background\r\n\r\nService medical records show that the veteran reported, at \r\nenlistment, a history of frequent trouble sleeping and \r\nindigestion associated with nervousness.  The remainder of \r\nhis service medical records, including the report of his \r\nexamination for discharge, are negative for any complaints, \r\nfinding or diagnosis of psychiatric disability.  The records \r\nshow that the veteran was placed in a weight control program.\r\n\r\nService personnel records show that the veteran served in \r\nVietnam from October 1966 to October 1967, and that he served \r\nas a bridgeman and guard during that time.  The records list \r\nhis expeditions as including counterinsurgency operations in \r\nthe Da Nang/Phu Bai area with the 3rd Bridge Company of 7th \r\nEngineering Battalion from October 1966 to January 1967; \r\ncounterinsurgency operations in the Da Nang area with the 1st \r\nBridge Company of 7th Engineering Battalion from January 1967 \r\nto October 1967; and Operation Stone in February 1967.  The \r\npersonnel records also show that the veteran underwent a \r\ncourse in landmine warfare and demolitions.  The personnel \r\nrecords show that the veteran served at Vieques, Puerto Rico, \r\nfrom February 1968 to May 1968.\r\n\r\nOn file are private treatment records for November 1983 to \r\nApril 1998 which show treatment for PTSD apparently based on \r\nthe veteran's reported experiences in Vietnam.  The \r\nreferenced experiences included participation in over 50 \r\ncombat missions and an experience as a prisoner of war for \r\ntwo weeks.\r\n\r\nOn file are records from the Social Security Administration \r\n(SSA) which show that the veteran is considered disabled by \r\nthat agency on the basis of a primary diagnosis of anxiety \r\nrelated disorders.  The records include the report of a \r\nDecember 1992 examination, at which time he attributed his \r\npsychiatric symptoms to his period of service.  He reported \r\nthat his stressful experiences in service included \r\nincinerating bodies, almost falling from a helicopter, and \r\nverbal and physical abuse encountered in a weight loss \r\nprogram in service.  The veteran was diagnosed with, inter \r\nalia, consider PTSD.  At an April 1998 examination, the \r\nveteran alleged that he was involved in combat and burned \r\nbodies while in service.  He was diagnosed with, inter alia, \r\nanxiety and depressive disorders, rule out personality \r\ndisorder, and rule out PTSD; the examiner concluded that \r\nwhile the veteran had some symptoms consistent with PTSD, it \r\nwas unclear whether he met all of the diagnostic criteria for \r\nthat disorder.\r\n\r\nOf record is the report of a December 1993 VA \r\nneuropsychiatric examination, at which time the veteran \r\nreported that he had served as a combat engineer in Vietnam, \r\nand that his basic duties had included building bridges that \r\nwere repeatedly destroyed by the enemy; he indicated that his \r\npositions were attacked and shelled frequently.  He also \r\nreported performing mine sweeps, patrols, and guard duty.  \r\nThe examiner diagnosed the veteran with an anxiety disorder \r\nand a mixed personality disorder.\r\n\r\nOn file is the report of a December 1993 VA psychological \r\nexamination, at which time the veteran reported that his \r\npsychiatric symptoms began in boot camp from physical and \r\nverbal abuse he experienced, particularly in connection with \r\na weight loss unit to which he was assigned.  He also \r\nreported incidents in which he was shot at by snipers while \r\nrebuilding bridges, and indicated that he had engaged in \r\ncombat and was required to burn bodies in service.  The \r\nexaminer noted that the veteran demonstrated a lack of \r\nemotional involvement when describing his experiences, and \r\nthat psychological testing revealed an extreme level of \r\nsymptom over-reporting; the examiner also noted \r\ninconsistencies between what the veteran reported at the \r\ninterview and what he reported at testing.  The examiner \r\nconcluded that the clear presence of PTSD could not be \r\ndetermined, that the veteran had a personality disorder \r\nlikely rooted in a dysfunctional and abusive childhood, and \r\nthat the veteran's psychiatric symptoms could not be clearly \r\ntied to his service experiences.  The veteran was diagnosed \r\nwith anxiety disorder, dysthymia; organic mental disorder; \r\nand personality disorder with antisocial and schizotypal \r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nAt an April 1997 hearing before a hearing officer at the RO, \r\nthe veteran testified that he was beaten to unconsciousness \r\nand forced to exercise excessively in boot camp as part of a \r\nweight loss program, although he was unable to remember the \r\nname of the responsible drill instructor.  He testified that \r\nhe fought hand to hand with enemy soldiers in Vietnam, and \r\nthat his positions were shot at and overrun while he was \r\nengaged in repairing bridges.  He stated that he had killed \r\nenemy soldiers and witnessed the deaths of many American \r\nsoldiers, but that he was unable to recall the names of any \r\nof those killed, except for that of a certain friend.  He \r\nexplained that this friend died during an infiltration of the \r\nbase camp in Da Nang.  He testified that when daylight broke \r\nthe day after the infiltration, he was ordered by an officer \r\nto kill a Vietnamese garbage detail, and that the officer \r\nrendered him unconscious when he refused to obey the order.  \r\nThe veteran also testified that he witnessed the brutal \r\ninterrogation of an enemy soldier in service and that, \r\nfollowing his service in Vietnam, he was transferred to \r\nPuerto Rico, where he assumed responsibility for suppressing \r\nriots by Marines through the use of deadly force.\r\n\r\nIn a September 1998 statement, the U.S. Marine Corps \r\nessentially indicated that the veteran's claimed stressors \r\ncould not be verified as the information provided by him \r\nprecluded any meaningful research because of the lack of \r\nspecific combat incidents as recalled by the veteran.  The \r\nstatement cautioned that anecdotal incidents were not \r\nresearchable.\r\n\r\nIn a January 2000 statement, the U.S. Marine Corps provided \r\ncopies of the unit diaries for the 1st and 3rd Bridge \r\ncompanies for the period from October 1966 to February 1967, \r\nand indicated that the referenced records showed that one \r\nmarine drowned in November 1966 and another was wounded in \r\nFebruary 1967.  The statement indicates that the veteran's \r\ncontention that a friend of his was killed (during an attack \r\non his base camp) could not be verified.  The statement also \r\nindicates that available records did not support the \r\nveteran's contention that he was a prisoner of war or that he \r\nhad participated in several combat operations.\r\n\r\nOn file are Command Chronologies for the 7th Engineering \r\nBattalion (including for the 1st and 3rd Bridge Companies), \r\nreceived in August 2000.  The chronologies show that in \r\nOctober 1966, while the veteran's unit was in Vietnam, mine \r\nsweep teams received incoming fire, and trucks in a convoy \r\nwere ambushed; that in November 1966 mine sweep teams \r\nencountered sniper fire; that in December 1966, several \r\nbunkers were attacked by sniper fire and hand grenade \r\nattacks; that in February 1967, a detail from the 1st Bridge \r\nCompany received enemy fire, with one person wounded in \r\naction; that also in February 1967 a bridge repair detail \r\nreceived incoming bullet and mortar fire and responded; that \r\nin April 1967 a 1st bridge company ferry site received one \r\nround of sniper fire; that in August 1967 the command post \r\nfor the 7th Engineering Battalion was attacked, with one \r\nsoldier killed and three wounded; that in September 1967 the \r\nbattalion headquarters received rocket and bullet fire on a \r\nnumber of occasions; and that also in September 1967 the 1st \r\nBridge Company experienced casualties from a landmine \r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\nOn VA examination in December 2000, the veteran reported that \r\nenemy soldiers would destroy the bridges he built in Vietnam, \r\nand that he would perform minesweeping and trap-clearing \r\noperations; he indicated that he received sniper attacks on \r\nmany of these occasions, and that he would also pull guard \r\nduty.  He also claimed that he was a prisoner of war.  The \r\nexaminer diagnosed the veteran with PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn an October 2001 statement, Janet Jones, M.Ed., indicated \r\nthat she had treated the veteran for symptoms of PTSD and \r\nnoted that the veteran experienced nightmares related to \r\ncombat experiences.\r\n\r\nThe veteran was afforded a VA examination in October 2001, \r\nwhich was conducted by the same psychologist who examined the \r\nveteran in December 1993.  The veteran reported that he had \r\nbeen humiliated in boot camp on account of his weight.  He \r\nalso reported stressful events in Vietnam including exposure \r\nto sniper and mortar fire, and indicated that he had \r\nresponded with deadly force and watched the impact of his \r\nrounds on enemy soldiers.  The veteran also reported several \r\nstressful experiences encountered during minesweeping \r\noperations, and described other experiences in service that \r\ncaused him distress.  The examiner noted that prior diagnoses \r\nof PTSD contained in the record were not based on a detailed \r\ndescription of the veteran's claimed stressors or military \r\nhistory, and that if the veteran's reported combat traumas \r\nwere taken at face value, then the veteran would likely meet \r\nthe threshold stress to support a diagnosis of PTSD.  The \r\nexaminer noted, however, that psychological testing of the \r\nveteran was unreliable secondary to gross symptom over-\r\nreporting.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner noted that because of the veteran's over-\r\nreporting of symptoms, psychological testing again could not \r\nbe used to corroborate the presence or absence of PTSD.  The \r\nexaminer also noted that the veteran reported a clear history \r\nof family-of-origin dysfunction and a troubled childhood \r\nstrongly suggestive of the presence of pre-service \r\npsychopathology, including alcoholism and a personality \r\ndisorder.  The examiner noted that the veteran's presentation \r\nwas often incongruent with a PTSD related to his claimed \r\nevents.  The examiner concluded that the veteran technically \r\nmet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, based on his report \r\nof combat experiences, but formally diagnosed the veteran \r\nwith dysthymic disorder; alcohol and marijuana abuse; PTSD by \r\nhistory; and personality disorder with anti-social and \r\nschizotypal features.\r\n\r\nIn an October 2002 statement, the U.S. Marine Corps confirmed \r\nthat a formal platoon-sized or better unit for weight control \r\nand a motivation/special training unit existed.  The \r\nstatement indicates that the above units were strictly \r\nmonitored, and that higher headquarters took interest in the \r\nrecruits on weight control and the methods utilized by drill \r\ninstructors to enhance weight loss.  Attached to the October \r\n2002 statement was a history of the Marine Corps Recruit \r\nDepot at Parris Island, South Carolina, for 1891 to 1962 \r\nwhich shows that special training companies were formed to \r\nprovide remedial training for, inter alia, overweight \r\nrecruits; the overweight recruits were exposed to special \r\ndiets and exercise.\r\n\r\nOn file is the report of a January 2003 VA examination of the \r\nveteran.  The veteran reported stressors including \r\nparticipating in the incineration of bodies, becoming trapped \r\nby the enemy while building a bridge in Vietnam in October \r\n1966, and being captured by and escaping from enemy soldiers.  \r\nFollowing mental status evaluation, the examiner diagnosed \r\nthe veteran with, inter alia, PTSD.  The examiner concluded \r\nthat the veteran's previously reported stressors of \r\nexperiencing sniper and rocket mortar attacks were \r\nsufficient, in and of themselves, to have caused his PTSD.\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred or aggravated during active \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 \r\n(2002).  Entitlement to service connection for PTSD requires \r\nmedical evidence establishing a clear diagnosis of the \r\ncondition, credible supporting evidence that the claimed \r\ninservice stressor actually occurred, and a link, established \r\nby medical evidence, between current symptomatology and the \r\nclaimed inservice stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1998).\r\n\r\nOn June 18, 1999, during the pendency of this appeal, \r\n� 3.304(f) was amended, effective March 7, 1997, to provide:  \r\nService connection for post-traumatic stress disorder \r\nrequires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in \r\naccordance with � 4.125(a) of this chapter; a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence, between current symptoms and \r\nan in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that \r\nthe claimed in-service stressor occurred.  64 Fed. Reg. \r\n32807-32808 (1999).\r\n\r\nOn March 7, 2002, 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) was again amended with \r\nrespect to the type of evidence that may be relevant in \r\ncorroborating a veteran's statement regarding the occurrence \r\nof a stressor in claims for service connection of PTSD \r\nresulting from personal assault.  See 67 Fed. Reg. 10,330 \r\n(2002).  Specifically, 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) as amended \r\nprovides that if a post-traumatic stress disorder claim is \r\nbased on in-service personal assault:\r\n\r\n[E]vidence from sources other than the veteran's service \r\nrecords may corroborate the veteran's account of the \r\nstressor incident.  Examples of such evidence include, \r\nbut are not limited to: records from law enforcement \r\nauthorities, rape crisis centers, mental health \r\ncounseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy \r\ntests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and \r\nstatements from family members, roommates, fellow \r\nservice members, or clergy.  Evidence of behavior \r\nchanges following the claimed assault is one type of \r\nrelevant evidence that may be found in these sources.  \r\nExamples of behavior changes that may constitute \r\ncredible evidence of the stressor include, but are not \r\nlimited to: a request for a transfer to another military \r\nduty assignment; deterioration in work performance; \r\nsubstance abuse; episodes of depression, panic attacks, \r\nor anxiety without an identifiable cause; or unexplained \r\neconomic or social behavior changes.  VA will not deny a \r\npost-traumatic stress disorder claim that is based on \r\nin-service personal assault without first advising the \r\nclaimant that evidence from sources other than the \r\nveteran's service records or evidence of behavior \r\nchanges may constitute credible supporting evidence of \r\nthe stressor and allowing him or her the opportunity to \r\nfurnish this type of evidence or advise VA of potential \r\nsources of such evidence.  VA may submit any evidence \r\nthat it receives to an appropriate medical or mental \r\nhealth professional for an opinion as to whether it \r\nindicates that a personal assault occurred. \r\n\r\nIn Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91 (1993), the United States \r\nCourt of Appeals for Veterans Claims (known as the United \r\nStates Court of Veterans Appeals before March 1, 1999, \r\nhereinafter Court) set forth the analytical framework and \r\nline of reasoning for determining whether a veteran was \r\nexposed to a recognizable stressor during service, which, as \r\ndiscussed above, is an essential element in solidifying a \r\nclaim for service connection for PTSD.  In Zarycki, it was \r\nnoted that, under 38 U.S.C.A. 1154(b), 38 C.F.R. 3.304(d) and \r\n(f), and the applicable provisions contained in VA Manual 21-\r\n1, the evidence necessary to establish the incurrence of a \r\nrecognizable stressor during service to support a claim of \r\nservice connection for PTSD will vary depending on whether \r\nthe veteran \"engaged in combat with the enemy.\"  See Hayes v. \r\nBrown, 5 Vet. App. 60 (1993).  The determination as to \r\nwhether the veteran \"engaged in combat with the enemy\" is \r\nmade, in part, by considering military citations that \r\nexpressly denote as much.  Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, \r\n289 (1994).  \r\n\r\nIf combat is affirmatively indicated, then the veteran's lay \r\ntestimony regarding claimed combat-related stressors must be \r\naccepted as conclusive as to their actual occurrence and no \r\nfurther development or corroborative evidence will be \r\nrequired, provided that the veteran's testimony is found to \r\nbe \"satisfactory,\" i.e., credible, and \"consistent with the \r\ncircumstances, conditions, or hardships of such service.\"  \r\nZarycki, 6 Vet. App. at 98.\r\n\r\nIf there is no combat experience, or if there is a \r\ndetermination that the veteran engaged in combat but the \r\nclaimed stressor is not related to such combat, there must be \r\nindependent evidence to corroborate the veteran's statement \r\nas to the occurrence of the claimed stressor.  Doran, 6 Vet. \r\nApp. at 288-89 (1994).  The veteran's testimony, by itself, \r\ncannot, as a matter of law, establish the occurrence of a \r\nnon-combat stressor.  Dizoglio, 9 Vet. App. at 166 (1996).\r\n\r\nAlthough the veteran contends that he engaged in combat on a \r\nnumber of occasions and was a prisoner of war, his service \r\ndepartment has been unable to verify either that he was \r\ninvolved in combat or that he was ever taken prisoner in \r\nVietnam.  Moreover, none of the veteran's award and \r\ndecorations, which include the National Defense Service \r\nMedal, the Vietnamese Service Medal and the Vietnamese \r\nCampaign Medal, are indicative of participation in combat.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Board finds that the Command Chronologies \r\nfor the veteran's unit do verify at least two of the \r\nveteran's claimed stressors--that of receiving sniper fire \r\nwhile engaged in the building or repairing of bridges, and \r\nthat of receiving sniper fire at a ferry site.  Specifically, \r\nthe chronologies show that a detail from the veteran's \r\ncompany received sniper fire in February 1967, and that the \r\nveteran's company was attacked by a sniper in April 1967 at a \r\nferry site.  Although the Command Chronologies do not \r\nidentify the veteran as being present during the above two \r\nevents, the Court has held that corroboration of every \r\ndetail, such as the veteran's own personal involvement, is \r\nnot necessary.  See Pentecost v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 124 \r\n(2002); Suozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307 (1997).  The Board \r\ntherefore accepts the description in the chronologies of the \r\nabove two events as satisfactory corroboration of the \r\nveteran's claimed stressor of receiving sniper fire in \r\nservice.  Since, as will be discussed immediately below, the \r\nBoard is able to grant the benefit sought on appeal based on \r\nthe verification of the above two stressors alone (along with \r\ncertain medical evidence on file), there is no need for the \r\nBoard to further address any of the other stressful events \r\nalleged by the veteran to have occurred during his period of \r\nservice.\r\n\r\nReview of the medical evidence shows that the veteran has \r\nbeen diagnosed with PTSD on more than one occasion by both \r\ntreating and examining physicians.  While the examiner who \r\nconducted the December 1993 and October 2001 examinations was \r\nunable to positively conclude that the veteran had PTSD, the \r\nexaminer did find that the veteran met the technical criteria \r\nfor that diagnosis.  In any event, the veteran was examined \r\nin January 2003 by a psychiatrist who reviewed the claims \r\nfiles and who not only concluded that the veteran had PTSD, \r\nbut who also concluded that the veteran's verified stressors \r\nof sniper attacks were sufficient to have caused the PTSD. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, since the Board finds that the veteran has \r\nsubmitted competent evidence of a current diagnosis of PTSD; \r\ncredible supporting evidence that a claimed in-service \r\nstressor actually occurred; and medical evidence of a causal \r\nnexus between current symptomatology and the specific claimed \r\nin-service stressor, the Board concludes that the weight of \r\ncompetent and credible evidence supports a grant of service \r\nconnection for PTSD.  Thus, the benefit sought on appeal is \r\ngranted. \r\n\r\nIn deciding this claim, the Board has considered the \r\napplicability of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 \r\n(VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000) (codified \r\nas amended at 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, \r\n5107, 5126 (West 2002)), as implemented by VA regulations, 66 \r\nFed. Reg. 45,620, 45,630-32 (Aug. 29, 2001) (codified as \r\namended at 38 C.F.R  �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326(a) \r\n(2002)), which became effective during the pendency of this \r\nappeal.  The VCAA, among other things, modified VA's duties \r\nto notify and to assist claimants.  See generally VCAA, �� \r\n3,4,7; see also Holliday v. Principi, 14 Vet. App. 280, 284-\r\n86 (2001).  \r\n\r\nIn this case, the Board finds that the VCAA's duty-to-notify \r\nprovision has been fulfilled as evidenced by the supplemental \r\nstatements of the case dated in October 1997, March 2000 and \r\nNovember 2001, and by September 1998 and June 2000 letters to \r\nthe veteran which essentially advised him of the information \r\nand evidence needed to substantiate his claim, and of the \r\nrespective responsibilities of him and VA in obtaining \r\nevidence in connection with the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) \r\n(West 2002).  See Quartuccio v. Principi , 16 Vet. App. 183 \r\n(2002).  Moreover, the record reflects that VA's duty-to-\r\nassist the veteran in the instant claim has been fulfilled.  \r\nIn any event, in light of the grant of the veteran's claim, \r\nthe Board finds that further delay of the appellate process \r\nfor the purpose of addressing any lingering duties required \r\nby the VCAA or by the implementing regulations is not \r\nwarranted. \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tMARK F.

L. Mason, Senior Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from September 1990 to May \r\n1991 which included service in Southwest Asia from November \r\n1990 to April 1991.\r\n\r\nThis matter came to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on \r\nappeal from a January 2000 rating decision from the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nMontgomery, Alabama.  The veteran and her representative \r\nappeared at a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge via video \r\nin March 2002.   \r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Board observes that the RO attempted to verify the \r\nveteran's stressors with the U.S. Armed Services Center for \r\nResearch of Unit Records (USACRUR); however, USACRUR \r\nindicated that more specific stressors were needed.  At her \r\nhearing and in statements of record, the veteran described \r\nevents she witnessed while serving in Southwest Asia during \r\nthe Persian Gulf War, which include scud missile attacks in \r\nthe area of camp and seeing dead bodies along the road to \r\nfront line.  Moreover, the veteran's claims file reveals that \r\nshe served with the 851st Supply and Service CO, HHC 1-10th \r\nAVE Regt., TRADOC TC US Army Reserves out of Alabama, under \r\nthe 24th ID, US Army.  Under VCAA, the VA has a duty to \r\nassist the veteran in development of her claim.  As she has \r\nattempted identified events with more specificity, the RO \r\nshould again request verification from USACRUR to include \r\nreports of unit activities.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, this case is REMANDED for the following:\r\n\r\nThe RO should contact the U.S. Armed \r\nServices Center for Research of Unit \r\nRecords (USASCRUR), and request any \r\navailable information, to include unit \r\nreports showing areas of operations from \r\nNovember 1990 to April 1991 to include \r\nwhether this area came under scud missile \r\nattacks or whether the veteran's unit \r\nprovided supply services to the \r\nfrontlines, which might corroborate the \r\nveteran's alleged in-service stressors.  \r\nThe veteran served in 851st Supply & \r\nService CO, HHC 1-10th AVE Regt., TRADOC \r\nTC US Army Reserves out of Alabama, under \r\nthe 24th ID, US Army from Fort Stewart, \r\nGA in Southwest Asia from November 6, \r\n1990 to April 15, 1991.  Provide USASCRUR \r\nwith a description of the veteran's \r\nalleged stressors: scud missile attacks \r\nin the area of camp and seeing dead \r\nbodies along the road to front line.  \r\nProvide USASCRUR with copies of any \r\npersonnel records obtained showing \r\nservice dates, duties, and units of \r\nassignment.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded to \r\nthe regional office.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 \r\n(1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment by the RO.  \r\nThe law requires that all claims that are remanded by the \r\nBoard of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or \r\nother appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious \r\nmanner.

Kissel, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant served on active duty from November 1981 to \r\nNovember 1984, and from January 1991 to April 1991.\r\n\r\nThis case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) \r\non appeal from an October 1995 rating decision of the St. \r\nPetersburg, Florida, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \r\nRegional Office (RO).  The RO in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, \r\npresently has jurisdiction over this case.\r\n\r\nNo further action will be taken with regard to the \r\nappellant's request for a hearing before the Board.  She did \r\nnot appear for her hearing scheduled on April 11, 2003, and \r\nno explanation for her failure to report or a request to \r\nschedule a new hearing has been submitted in connection with \r\nthis appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the efforts undertaken by the RO to prepare \r\nthis case for appellate review, the Board finds that a remand \r\nis in order.\r\n\r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000\r\n\r\nThe Board will remand the appellant's claim of service \r\nconnection for PTSD to ensure full and complete compliance \r\nwith the enhanced duty-to-notify and duty-to-assist \r\nprovisions enacted by the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of \r\n2000 (VCAA) Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000) (the \r\nVCAA) [codified as amended at 38 U.S.C. �� 5102, 5103, 5103A, \r\n5107], as this claim was pending as of the date of passage of \r\nthis law, November 9, 2000.  Karnas v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. \r\n308, 313 (1991) (where law/regulation changes after claim has \r\nbeen filed, but before administrative or judicial appeal \r\nprocess has concluded, version most favorable to claimant \r\nshould apply).\r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the \r\nCourt) has held that all provisions of the VCAA are \r\npotentially applicable to claims pending on the date of the \r\nlaw's enactment, and that concerns of fundamental fairness \r\nand fair process demanded further development and \r\nreadjudication under the VCAA by the lower adjudicatory \r\nauthority (the Board and RO).  See Holliday v. Principi, 14 \r\nVet. App. 280 (2001), mot. for recons. denied, 14 Vet. App. \r\n327 (per curium order), mot. for full Court review denied, 15 \r\nVet. App. 21 (2001) (en banc order).  Regarding its authority \r\nto review the Board's decision on appeal, the Court in \r\nHolliday stated that even assuming that it could divine in \r\nthe first instance on the particular facts of a particular \r\ncase that no amount of additional evidence could change an \r\nadverse outcome, it could not obviate in the first instance \r\nthe requirement for VA to provide notice to the claimant as \r\nto what was required for a claim to be successful under the \r\nVCAA's newly-created duty-to-notify provisions, 38 U.S.C. �� \r\n5102(b), 5103(a).  Id; see also Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 \r\nVet. App. 183, 187 (2002) (when VA receives substantially \r\ncomplete application for benefits, it has obligation to \r\nnotify claimant of any information and medical or lay \r\nevidence necessary to substantiate the claim).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the VCAA-notice letter sent to the appellant by \r\nthe RO in May 2002 is inadequate for purposes of this appeal \r\nas the content of that letter addressed an unrelated claim of \r\nservice connection for depression based on in-service \r\nexposure to environmental hazards.  It is clear from the \r\nCourt's recent case law that the VCAA's duty-to-notify \r\nprovisions and all assistance provided therein must be \r\nspecific to the claim or claims under consideration.  \r\nQuartuccio, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002); see also Charles v. \r\nPrincipi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).  And, as will be set forth \r\nin greater detail below, this requirement is particularly \r\nimportant with respect to claims of service connection for \r\nPTSD based on personal assault.  The Board must therefore \r\nremand the appellant's PTSD claim because the record does not \r\nshow that she was provided proper notice under the VCAA.\r\n\r\nRegulatory amendments\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the regulation governing the award of \r\nservice connection for PTSD, 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), was \r\namended in June 1999.  See 64 Fed. Reg. 32807 (June 18, \r\n1999).  The new version of the regulation is effective from \r\nMarch 7, 1997, and hence, the revised version must be \r\nconsidered, which has not been done in this case, to include \r\nwhen the RO readjudicated the claim by supplemental statement \r\nof the case in November 2002.  Of significance here is the \r\nchange to section 3.304(f) which eliminated the requirement \r\nfor a \"clear diagnosis\" of PTSD and replaced it with the \r\ncriteria that an award of service connection depended on \r\nwhether there was medical evidence diagnosing the condition \r\nin accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a), which the Board \r\nobserves is a reference to a diagnosis made on the criteria \r\nset forth in the DSM-IV.  In its decisions issued with this \r\nappeal, the RO applied the now-deleted \"clear diagnosis\" \r\nstandard.  As additional evidentiary development will be \r\nrequired, to include stressor-verification development, the \r\nBoard believes that the RO should have the appellant re-\r\nexamined by VA in order to determine whether she has a DSM-IV \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD based on her reported stressors and a \r\ncomplete review of all the evidence in the claims file.  In \r\nthe Board's view, the appellate record does not at this time \r\ncontain sufficient medical evidence to decide this claim.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(d)(1) and (2), as amended by the \r\nVCAA.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes as well that 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) was amended \r\nfor a second time in March 2002, again, during the pendency \r\nof this appeal.  See 67 Fed. Reg. 10332 (Mar. 7, 2002).  This \r\nregulation is specifically germane to the development and \r\nadjudication of this claim as the revision involves the \r\nstandard of proof and the type of evidence necessary to \r\nsubstantiate a claim of service connection for PTSD based on \r\npersonal assault.  It also specifically provides that VA will \r\nnot deny this type of PTSD claim without first advising the \r\nclaimant that evidence from sources other than the veteran's \r\nservice records or evidence of behavior changes may \r\nconstitute credible supporting evidence of the stressor and \r\nallowing him or her the opportunity to furnish this type of \r\nevidence or advise VA of potential sources of such evidence.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) (2002).  The record shows that the RO \r\nsent the appellant PTSD-personal assault development letters \r\nin 1996 and 1999, predating the revised section 3.304(f)(3), \r\nand although these letters set forth many of the same \r\nrequirements contemplated by the revised regulation, they do \r\nnot specifically advise her in the manner described by this \r\nnew regulation.  Given the other deficiencies described above \r\nwith regard to procedural due process and evidentiary \r\ndevelopment of this case, the Board finds that full and \r\ncomplete compliance with the amended section 3.304(f)(3) is \r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nBecause the above-cited regulations changed during the \r\npendency of this appeal, the appellant is entitled to the \r\napplication of the versions of the regulations that are more \r\nfavorable to her.  Karnas, 1 Vet. App. 308 (1991).  In this \r\ncase, the appellant has not been notified of the changes in \r\nthe regulations described above and has not been afforded any \r\nopportunity to present relevant argument.\r\n\r\nEvidentiary development\r\n\r\nIn an effort to assist the RO, the Board has reviewed the \r\nclaims file and identified certain assistance that must be \r\nrendered to comply with the VCAA.  Specifically, additional \r\nevidentiary development is required, to include stressor-\r\nverification development and the scheduling of the appellant \r\nfor a VA examination to determine whether she has a DSM-IV \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD based on her reported stressor and a \r\ncomplete review of all the evidence in the claims file.  \r\nHowever, it is the RO's responsibility to ensure that all \r\nappropriate development is undertaken in this case.\r\n\r\nThe Board also notes that precedent holdings of the Court \r\nprovide specific guidance for the adjudication of PTSD claims \r\nbased on non-combat stressors, at issue in this case.  See \r\nPatton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272 (1999) (verification of non-\r\ncombat stressors); Suozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307 (1997) \r\n(sufficiency of information to verify stressors); Cohen v. \r\nBrown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997) and Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. \r\nApp. 389 (1996).  In the Patton case, the Court found error \r\nin the Board's decision because it did not discuss the \r\nspecial evidentiary procedures for the development of PTSD \r\nclaims based on non-combat stressors as established by VA \r\nguidelines.  Patton, 12 Vet. App. 272 (1999).  Where, as in \r\nthis case, the claimant did not serve in combat and the \r\nclaimed stressor is not related to combat, lay testimony, by \r\nitself, will not be enough to establish the occurrence of the \r\nalleged stressor.  Id. citing West (Carelton) v. Brown, 7 \r\nVet. App. 70, 76 (1994); Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 \r\n(1993).\r\n\r\nIn these types of cases, special development procedures for \r\nnon-combat stressors are required pursuant to VA's \r\nADJUDICATION PROCEDURE MANUAL (the M21-1) in order to provide \r\nthe veteran-claimant every opportunity to verify the \r\noccurrence of the claimed stressor.  See M21-1, Part III, \r\nSection 5.14 (Mar. 2002).\r\n\r\nIn light of the Court's precedent holdings, the Board finds \r\nit necessary to address the matter of whether there is \r\nsufficient corroboration of the appellant's stressor (in-\r\nservice rape and sexual harassment) upon completion of the \r\nspecial development procedures under M21-1, Part III, Sec. \r\n5.14, and upon completion thereof, further medical \r\ndevelopment to determine whether any \"markers\" or \r\n\"behavioral changes\" that occurred at or close in time to \r\nthe alleged incident could possibly indicate the occurrence \r\nof the stressor, as described in detail in the M21-1.\r\n\r\nIn this particular case, the RO determined in its November \r\n2002 supplemental statement of the case that review of the \r\nappellant's service personnel records (201 file) would be \r\n\"useless\" because she failed to provide more specific and \r\ndetailed information concerning her alleged stressors.  \r\nHowever, the Board reviewed the documents in the appellant's \r\n201 file, which are of record, and found that in the latter \r\nhalf of 1982 while stationed at the Walter Reed Army Medical \r\nCenter (WRAMC), she received a negative performance \r\nevaluation (compared with her other evaluations) as well as \r\nnon-judicial punishment involving a dispute with a superior \r\nofficer over an order she refused to obey.  Although she has \r\nnot been forthcoming with specific details, the appellant has \r\nindicated that all of her alleged stressors occurred at \r\nWRAMC.  The M21-1 manual provisions described above as well \r\nas the revised section 3.304(f)(3) criteria identify job-\r\nperformance and related incidents (e.g., deterioration in \r\nwork performance and disregard for military authority) as \r\npossible \"markers\" that could be used to corroborate an \r\nalleged stressor.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the Board's view, the 201 file reports, when \r\nread together with other evidence, namely, the VA outpatient \r\ntreatment report dated in August 1994 (which related her \r\naccount of an in-service rape ten years ago, corresponding to \r\nher time at WRAMC) and her September 1995 claim statement and \r\nthe report of the October 1995 VA examination (which each \r\nalluded to her account of seeing private psychiatrists and \r\ntherapists soon after service for the problems she \r\nencountered at WRAMC), indicates that further \"markers\" \r\ndevelopment of her case is needed.  There also is shown in \r\nthis case a subsequent history of mental decompensation in \r\nthe post service period, not otherwise suggested by the \r\nservice medical and personnel records, which in the Board's \r\nopinion, requires further expert psychiatric analysis to \r\ndetermine whether the appellant's diagnosis and clinical \r\nhistory are consistent with the tell-tale signs of PTSD based \r\non the alleged rape/harassment stressors (which by all \r\naccounts of record will never be affirmatively verified by \r\nofficial record).\r\n\r\nWith respect to the issue of stressor-verification, it is \r\nnoted that in Suozzi, the Court expressly held that a veteran \r\nneed not prove \"every detail\" of an alleged stressor.  Id. \r\nat 311.  In addition, in Moreau, the Court stated that \r\ncredible supporting evidence of a stressor may be obtained \r\nfrom service records or \"other sources.\"  Id. at 395.\r\n\r\nThe Board is of course aware that the appellant has been less \r\nthan cooperative in the development of her PTSD claim (she \r\nfailed to report for two hearings and never responded to the \r\nRO's 1996 and 1999 personal assault development letters).  \r\nHowever, the procedural due process requirements imposed by \r\nthe VCAA as well as by the regulation changes and Court \r\ndecisions dealing with PTSD-personal assault cases sets forth \r\nspecific and unambiguous development standards that must be \r\nmet before the Board issues a final decision on the merits. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, although the Board sincerely regrets the \r\nadditional delay, the case is REMANDED for the following:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO must review the claims file \r\nand ensure that all notification and \r\ndevelopment action required by the VCAA \r\nis completed under 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5102, \r\n5103, 5103A, and 5107 (West 2002), \r\nincluding written notice of the evidence, \r\nif any, the appellant is expected to \r\nprovide in support of the claim and the \r\nevidence, if any, that the RO will obtain \r\nfor her.  In particular, this notice \r\nshould advise the appellant that she may \r\nsubmit any corroborating lay and/or \r\nmedical evidence she may have pertaining \r\nto treatment for her PTSD symptoms.  \r\n\r\n2.  The RO should assist the appellant in \r\nobtaining any identified evidence, as \r\nappropriate.  If she identifies medical \r\ntreatment and provides specific dates, \r\nall VA records identified in this manner \r\nthat have not already been associated \r\nwith the claims file should be obtained \r\npursuant to established procedures.  With \r\nregard to any private medical treatment, \r\nif identified as such, after first \r\nproviding her appropriate releases to \r\nobtain such records (VA Form 21-4142), \r\nattempts to secure copies of records \r\npertaining to any indicated private \r\nphysicians and/or facilities should be \r\nundertaken.  The RO should proceed with \r\nalternative search efforts for any \r\nmedical records that may have been \r\ntransferred to another medical facility \r\nor retired.  All records received in \r\nresponse to the request should be \r\nassociated with the claims folder.  The \r\nRO should proceed with all reasonable \r\nfollow-up referrals that may be indicated \r\nby the inquiry.\r\n\r\nAll attempts to obtain records which are \r\nultimately not obtained should be \r\ndocumented, and in accordance with the \r\nVCAA and implementing regulations \r\npublished in August 2001, the RO should \r\nnotify the appellant of the records it \r\nwas unable to obtain, briefly explain the \r\nefforts made to obtain such records, and \r\ndescribe any further action that the RO \r\nwill take to obtain such records.  For \r\nany VA or other Federal department or \r\nagency records, the RO should continue \r\nits efforts to obtain any records while \r\nthe case is under development on remand \r\nuntil it becomes reasonably certain that \r\nsuch records cannot be obtained because \r\nthey do not exist or until it becomes \r\nreasonably certain that further efforts \r\nto obtain records from the such sources \r\nwould be futile.\r\n\r\n3.  In addition, the RO should contact \r\nthe appellant and inform her that may \r\nsubmit any other corroborating evidence \r\nshe may have pertaining to alleged rape \r\nand sexual harassment incidents \r\nexperienced during service.  The RO \r\nshould inform her that she may submit any \r\nother evidence to verify her alleged \r\nstressors from military as well as \r\nnonmilitary sources.  The RO should \r\nassist the appellant in obtaining such \r\nevidence, as appropriate.  In connection \r\nwith this development, the RO should \r\nensure that all appropriate special \r\ndevelopment procedures mandated by M21-1, \r\nSection 5.14 and 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) \r\nfor verification of a non-combat stressor \r\nis fully accomplished and documented in \r\nthe claims folder, to include issuance of \r\nthe special development letter to the \r\nappellant advising her of the steps \r\nnecessary to verify her non-combat \r\nstressors.\r\n\r\n4.  Following the above, the RO must make \r\na specific factual determination, based \r\nupon the complete record, with respect to \r\nwhether one or more of the appellant's \r\nstressors occurred as she claims.  In \r\nrendering this determination, the \r\nattention of the RO is directed to the \r\nlaw cited in the discussion above.  If \r\nofficial service records or alternative \r\nrecords discussed in M21-1, Part III, \r\nSec. 5.14 corroborate the appellant's \r\nallegations, the RO should specify that \r\ninformation.  The RO should also indicate \r\nwhether any behavioral changes that \r\noccurred at or close in time to the \r\nalleged incidents could possibly indicate \r\nthe occurrence of a stressor and if so \r\nshould decide whether this evidence needs \r\ninterpretation by a clinician. \r\n\r\n5.  Upon completion of the above, the RO \r\nshould schedule a comprehensive VA \r\npsychiatric examination to determine the \r\ndiagnoses of all psychiatric disorders \r\nthat are present.  A psychiatrist who has \r\nnot previously examined, evaluated or \r\ntreated the appellant, if feasible, \r\nshould conduct this examination.  The \r\nclaims folder and a copy of this remand \r\nmust be provided to the examiner prior to \r\nthe examination.  The examiner should \r\ndetermine the true diagnoses of any \r\ncurrently manifested psychiatric \r\ndisorder(s).  The diagnosis(es) must be \r\nbased on examination findings, all \r\navailable medical records, complete \r\nreview of comprehensive testing for PTSD, \r\nand any special testing deemed \r\nappropriate.  A multiaxial evaluation \r\nbased on the current DSM-IV diagnostic \r\ncriteria is required.  If a diagnosis of \r\nPTSD is deemed appropriate, the examiner \r\nshould specify (1) whether the alleged \r\nstressor found to be established by the \r\nrecord was sufficient to produce PTSD; \r\nand (2) whether there is a link between \r\nthe current PTSD-symptomatology and the \r\nin-service stressor found to be \r\nestablished by the record and found \r\nsufficient to produce PTSD by the \r\nexaminer.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the examiner must comment on \r\nthe approximate date of onset and \r\netiology of any diagnosed psychiatric \r\ndisorder as shown by the evidence of \r\nrecord, and in so doing, the examiner \r\nshould attempt to reconcile the multiple \r\npsychiatric diagnoses and/or assessments \r\nof record based on his/her review of all \r\nof the evidence of record, particularly \r\nwith respect to prior diagnoses of PTSD.\r\n\r\nFurther, in line with the M21-1 \r\nprovisions, the examiner is requested to \r\nprovide detailed medical analysis and \r\ninterpretation of the diagnoses found \r\npresent on examination in light of all \r\nthe evidence of record for the purpose of \r\naddressing whether any behavioral changes \r\nthat occurred at or close in time to the \r\nalleged rape and sexual harassment \r\nincidents could possibly indicate the \r\noccurrence of an alleged in-service \r\nstressor.\r\n\r\nA complete rationale for all opinions \r\nexpressed must be provided.  The copy of \r\nthe examination report and all completed \r\ntest reports should thereafter be \r\nassociated with the claims folder.\r\n\r\n6.  The appellant must be given adequate \r\nnotice of any requested examination, \r\nwhich includes advising her of the \r\nconsequences of failure to report for a \r\nscheduled examination.  If she fails to \r\nreport for an examination, this fact \r\nshould be documented in the claims \r\nfolder.  A copy of all notifications must \r\nbe associated with the claims folder.\r\n\r\n7.  In addition, the RO should take all \r\nother proper measures to ensure full and \r\ncomplete compliance with the duty-to-\r\nnotify and duty-to-assist provisions of \r\nthe VCAA that are specifically germane to \r\nthe claim on appeal, service connection \r\nfor PTSD based on personal assault.  This \r\naction should include notifying the \r\nappellant of her right to submit \r\nadditional evidence or argument regarding \r\nthe merits of this claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.  After completion of the above, the RO \r\nshould readjudicate the issue of service \r\nconnection for PTSD based on personal \r\nassault with consideration given to all \r\nof the evidence of record, including any \r\nadditional medical evidence obtained by \r\nthe RO pursuant to this REMAND.  The \r\nreadjudication of this claim must be on \r\nthe merits and with full compliance with \r\nall relevant duty-to-notify and duty-to-\r\nassist provisions of the VCAA, as noted \r\nabove.  Further, the readjudication of \r\nthis claim must be in accord with the \r\nrevised 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), as amended \r\nin June 1999 and March 2002, which \r\ninclude the appropriate notice procedures \r\nset forth under the revised section \r\n� 3.304(f)(3) discussed above in this \r\nREMAND.  The RO should also carefully \r\nconsider the benefit of the doubt rule, \r\nand in this regard, if the evidence is \r\nnot in equipoise the RO should explain \r\nwhy.  Cartwright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. \r\nApp. 24, 26 (1991).  \r\n\r\nIf the benefit sought on appeal remains \r\ndenied, the RO should provide the \r\nappellant and her representative an \r\nadequate supplemental statement of the \r\ncase.  The supplemental statement of the \r\ncase must contain notice of all relevant \r\nactions taken on this claim, to include a \r\nsummary of the evidence and applicable \r\nlaw and regulations considered pertinent \r\nto the issues currently on appeal.  The \r\nSSOC should provide the veteran citation \r\nto 38 C.F.R. � 3.159.  The RO should then \r\nallow the appellant an appropriate period \r\nof time for response.\r\n\r\nThereafter, subject to current appellate procedures, the case \r\nshould be returned to the Board for further appellate \r\nconsideration, if appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded to \r\nthe RO.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment by the RO.  \r\nThe law requires that all claims that are remanded by the \r\nBoard of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or \r\nother appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious \r\nmanner.

DoMinh\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from October 1961 to \r\nSeptember 1964.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from a June 1996 rating decision by the Roanoke, \r\nVirginia, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) which, inter alia, denied the veteran's claim of \r\nentitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia (claimed \r\nas secondary to service-connected  PTSD).  In the course of \r\nthe appeal the Board remanded the claim to the RO in August \r\n1999 for additional evidentiary and procedural development.  \r\nAfter this development, the RO confirmed the denial of \r\nentitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia and the \r\nveteran continued his appeal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to authority granted by 67 Fed. Reg. 3,099, 3,104 \r\n(Jan. 23, 2002) (codified at 38 C.F.R. � 19.9(a)(2) (2002)) \r\nwhich was then in effect, the Board undertook additional \r\ndevelopment of the aforementioned issue in a memorandum dated \r\nNovember 2002.  Specifically, pursuant to the Board's \r\ndevelopment memorandum, the veteran was scheduled for a VA \r\nmedical examination so that a nexus opinion could be obtained \r\nin order to determine the relationship, if any, between his \r\nclaimed fibromyalgia and his military service.  This was \r\nconducted in April 2003 and the report of this examination \r\nhas been associated with the claims file.  Thereafter, the \r\nclaims file was returned to the Board in May 2003.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this appeal there was a significant \r\nchange in the law.  In the recently decided case of Disabled \r\nAmerican Veterans v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Nos. 02-\r\n7304, -7305, -7316 (Fed. Cir. May 1, 2003), the United States \r\nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (hereinafter \"the \r\nCourt\") determined that regulation 38 C.F.R. � 19.9(a)(2) \r\nwas invalid because it allowed the Board to consider \r\nadditional evidence without having to remand the case to the \r\nagency of original jurisdiction (i.e., the RO) for initial \r\nconsideration of the evidence and without having to obtain \r\nthe appellant's waiver, contrary to controlling statutes.  \r\nTherefore, the case should be remanded to the RO for \r\ndevelopment in compliance with the Court's decision in order \r\nto circumvent commission of any procedural defects.\r\n\r\nIn view of the foregoing discussion, the case is REMANDED to \r\nthe RO for the following development:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO must ensure that all notice \r\nand duty-to-assist provisions of the \r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act are \r\napplied in the development of the \r\nclaim.\r\n\r\n2.  After all development has been \r\ncompleted in accordance with VCAA, the \r\nRO should readjudicate the veteran's \r\nclaim of entitlement to service \r\nconnection for fibromyalgia.\r\n\r\n3.   If the claim is not resolved to \r\nthe satisfaction of the veteran, a \r\nSupplemental Statement of the Case \r\nshould be prepared and the veteran and \r\nhis representative should be given a \r\nreasonable period of time for reply.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded to \r\nthe regional office.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet.

Accordingly, appellate \r\nconsideration will be deferred and this case is REMANDED for \r\nthe following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should offer the veteran an \r\nopportunity to choose another \r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\n2.  The RO should obtain from the Social \r\nSecurity Administration the records \r\npertinent to the appellant's claim for \r\nSocial Security disability benefits as \r\nwell as the medical records relied upon \r\nconcerning that claim.\r\n\r\n3.  The RO should obtain the complete set \r\nof records relating to the veteran's \r\npsychiatric hospitalization at the \r\nWestchester County Medical Center in \r\nValhalla, New York, beginning in May 1995 \r\n(as well as any records of subsequent \r\nreassessment and/or treatment). \r\n\r\n4.

L. Prichard, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nOn April 25, 2002, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or \r\nBoard) ordered further development in your case.  Thereafter, \r\nyour case was sent to the Board's Evidence Development Unit \r\n(EDU), to undertake the requested development.  \r\n\r\nPrior to May 1, 2003, the Board's regulations provided that \r\nif further evidence, clarification of the evidence, \r\ncorrection of a procedural defect, or any other action was \r\nessential for a proper appellate decision, a Board Member or \r\npanel of Members could direct Board personnel to undertake \r\nthe action essential for a proper appellate decision.  See 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 19.9(a)(2) (2002).  \r\n\r\nHowever, on May 1, 2003, the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor the Federal Circuit (\"Federal Circuit\") invalidated 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 19.9(a)(2), in Disabled American Veterans v. \r\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, 327 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2003) \r\n(hereinafter \"DAV\").  The Federal Circuit held that 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 19.9(a)(2), in conjunction with the amended rule \r\ncodified at 38 C.F.R. � 20.1304, was inconsistent with 38 \r\nU.S.C. � 7104(a), because 38 C.F.R. � 19.9(a)(2), denies \r\nappellants \"one review on appeal to the Secretary\" when the \r\nBoard considers additional evidence without having to remand \r\nthe case to the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) for \r\ninitial consideration, and without having to obtain the \r\nappellant's waiver.  \r\n\r\nFollowing the Federal Circuit's decision in DAV, the General \r\nCounsel issued a precedential opinion, which concluded that \r\nDAV did not prohibit the Board from developing evidence in a \r\ncase before it, provided that the Board does not adjudicate \r\nthe claim based on any new evidence it obtains unless the \r\nclaimant waives initial consideration of such evidence by \r\nfirst-tier adjudicators in the Veterans Benefits \r\nAdministration (VBA).  VAOPGCPREC 1-03.  Based on this \r\nopinion, the Board continued, for a short time, to request \r\ndevelopment via the Board's EDU.  \r\n\r\nRecently, in light of the Federal Circuit Court's decision \r\nand other policy considerations, the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) determined that VBA would resume all development \r\nfunctions.  In other words, aside from the limited class of \r\ndevelopment functions that the Board is statutorily permitted \r\nto carry out, see 38 U.S.C.A. �� 7107(b), 7109(a), all \r\nevidence development will be conducted at the regional office \r\n(RO) level.  \r\n\r\nIn the event that you appeared at a hearing before a Veterans \r\nLaw Judge (VLJ) other than the VLJ signing this remand, be \r\nadvised that if your case is returned to the Board, it will \r\nbe reassigned to the VLJ who conducted your hearing.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this matter is REMANDED to the RO for the \r\nfollowing:  \r\n\r\n1.  Contact the U.S. Army Reserve \r\nPersonnel Center (ARPERCEN) and request \r\nall of the veteran's service personnel \r\nrecords in their possession for the \r\nveteran's service from November 1968 to \r\nMarch 1972, including his service in \r\nGermany from October 1979 to November \r\n1971 with the 529th Ordnance Company (Ord \r\nCo).  \r\n\r\nIf no such service personnel records can \r\nbe found, or if they have been destroyed, \r\nask for specific confirmation of that \r\nfact.  \r\n\r\n2.  After the development requested above \r\nhas been completed to the extent \r\npossible, the RO should again review the \r\nrecord.  If any benefit sought on appeal \r\nremains denied, the appellant and \r\nrepresentative, if any, should be \r\nfurnished a supplemental statement of the \r\ncase and given the opportunity to respond \r\nthereto.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the case should be returned to the Board, if in \r\norder.  The Board intimates no opinion as to the ultimate \r\noutcome of this case.  The appellant need take no action \r\nunless otherwise notified.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded to \r\nthe regional office.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 \r\n(1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment by the RO.  \r\nThe law requires that all claims that are remanded by the \r\nBoard of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or \r\nother appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious \r\nmanner.

Kang, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active duty from October 1966 to October \r\n1969.  He received the Purple Heart medal, and combat \r\ninfantryman badge.\r\n\r\nThis appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) from an August 2002 rating decision of the Buffalo, \r\nNew York, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) which denied service connection for PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that in a formal claim received in February \r\n2001 the veteran claimed entitlement to compensation for \r\n\"nerve disorder - numbness in feet/legs.\"  He was granted a \r\nnon-service pension based on Guillain-Barre syndrome.  \r\nHowever, it is unclear whether the veteran also seeks \r\nentitlement to service connection for his neurological \r\ndisorder.  This issue is referred to the RO for appropriate \r\naction.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe requirements for service connection for PTSD are laid \r\nout at 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2003).  Under that regulation, \r\nservice connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition, a link established by medical \r\nevidence between current symptoms and an in-service \r\nstressor, and credible supporting evidence of the claimed \r\nstressor.  The stressor will generally be conceded where, as \r\nin this case, the veteran engaged in combat, and the claimed \r\nstressor relates to combat.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(1).  \r\n\r\nThe current record contains no medical evidence of PTSD, and \r\nthe veteran has not reported any signs or symptoms of PTSD.  \r\nHowever, his representative reported in September 2002, that \r\nthe veteran had \"been advised to seek treatment by a \r\npsychiatrist, and to obtain the 'necessary' diagnosis.\"  The \r\nclaims folder contains no record of the veteran's \r\nconsultation with any psychiatrist.\r\n\r\nThe veteran's representative has repeatedly argued that the \r\nveteran should be afforded a VA psychiatric examination.  VA \r\nis obliged to provide an examination when the record \r\ncontains competent evidence that the claimant has a current \r\ndisability or signs and symptoms of a current disability, \r\nthe record indicates that the disability or signs and \r\nsymptoms of disability may be associated with active \r\nservice; and the record does not contain sufficient \r\ninformation to make a decision on the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5103A(d) (West 2002).  The evidence of a link between \r\ncurrent disability and service must be competent.  Wells v. \r\nPrincipi, 326 F.3d 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  \r\n\r\nIn this case the veteran has not reported signs or symptoms \r\nof PTSD, and there is no competent evidence of a PTSD \r\ndiagnosis.\r\n\r\nVA is required to provide notice to claimants of what \r\nevidence is needed to substantiate their claims, of what \r\nevidence they are responsible for obtaining, and of what \r\nevidence VA will undertake to obtain.  The RO attempted to \r\nprovide this notice in a letter dated in May 2002.  This \r\nnotice was provided in accordance with the provisions of 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1) and limited the appellant's time for \r\nresponse to 60 days.  \r\n\r\nIn a decision promulgated on September 22, 2003, Paralyzed \r\nVeterans of America v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, No. \r\n02-7007, -7008, -7009, -7010 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 22, 2003), the \r\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit \r\ninvalidated the 30-day response period contained in \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1) as inconsistent with 38 U.S.C.� \r\n5103(b)(1).  The Court made a conclusion similar to the one \r\nreached in Disabled Am. Veterans v. Secretary of Veterans \r\nAffairs, 327 F.3d 1339, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (reviewing a \r\nrelated Board regulation, 38 C.F.R. � 19.9).  The court \r\nfound that the 30-day period provided in � 3.159(b)(1) to \r\nrespond to a VCCA duty to notify is misleading and \r\ndetrimental to claimants whose claims are prematurely denied \r\nshort of the statutory one-year period provided for \r\nresponse.  Therefore, since this case is being remanded for \r\nadditional development or to cure a procedural defect, the \r\nRO must take this opportunity to inform the appellant that \r\nnotwithstanding the information previously provided, a full \r\nyear is allowed to respond to a VCAA notice.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, this case is REMANDED to the RO for the \r\nfollowing actions:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO must review the claims file and \r\nensure that all VCAA notice obligations \r\nhave been satisfied in accordance with the \r\nrecent decision in Paralyzed Veterans of \r\nAmerica v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, \r\nas well as 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5102, 5103, and \r\n5103A, (West 2002), and any other \r\napplicable legal precedent.\r\n\r\n2.  The RO should ask the veteran to \r\nprovide information needed to obtain \r\nrecords of all psychiatric treatment he \r\nhas received.  The RO should then take all \r\nnecessary steps to obtain those records.\r\n\r\n3.  If, after the requested development, \r\nthe record contains competent evidence of \r\na diagnosis, or signs and symptoms of \r\nPTSD; the RO should provide the veteran \r\nwith a VA examination to determine whether \r\nhe currently meets the criteria for a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD related to in-service \r\nstressors.\r\n\r\n4.  After the development requested above \r\nhas been completed to the extent possible, \r\nthe RO should readjudicate the veteran's \r\nclaims.  If the benefits sought continue \r\nto be denied the RO should issue a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case.  \r\nThereafter, if appropriate, the case \r\nshould be returned to the Board.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence \r\nand argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded \r\nto the regional office.

Hudson, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active duty in the Army from June 1953 to \r\nSepember 1958, and in the Air Force from October 1958 to May \r\n1973, at which point he retired based on 20 years of \r\nservice.  He appeals to the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) from an RO decision which denied service connection \r\nfor PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe Board incidentally notes that the veteran is service-\r\nconnected for several physical ailments, for which he is \r\nrated permanently and totally disabled based on individual \r\nunemployability.\r\n\r\nThe veteran claims he has PTSD due to stressors experienced \r\nduring his Air Force service in Vietnam.  According to \r\nservice personnel records, he served in Vietnam from October \r\n1967 to October 1968, during which time his duties were \r\nthose of a vehicle dispatcher with the 35th Transportation \r\nSquadron at Phan Rang Air Base.  The service records show \r\ndecorations for service in Vietnam but do not indicate \r\ncombat service.\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � \r\n4.125(a) [i.e., under the criteria of DSM-IV]; a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence, between the veteran's \r\ncurrent symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor \r\noccurred.  If the evidence establishes that the veteran \r\nengaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is \r\nrelated to that combat, in the absence of clear and \r\nconvincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the \r\nclaimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, \r\nconditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the \r\nveteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence \r\nof the claimed inservice stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\nIf it is not shown that a veteran engaged in combat, his \r\nassertions of service stressors are not sufficient to \r\nestablish their occurrence.  Rather, his alleged service \r\nstressors must be established by official service records or \r\nother credible supporting evidence.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f); \r\nPentecost v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 124 (2002); Fossie v. \r\nWest, 12 Vet. App. 1 (1998); Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. \r\n128 (1997); Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283 (1994).  \r\n\r\nThe veteran has reported particular service stressors, but \r\nthe RO has not attempted to verify them through the U.S. \r\nArmed Services Center for Unit Records Research (CURR).  \r\nOutpatient records which have been obtained include \r\nreferences to possible PTSD, although the veteran has not \r\nbeen given a VA compensation examination.  In written \r\nargument to the Board, the veteran's representative argues \r\nthat the VA should attempt to verify stressors and provide a \r\nVA examination.  The Board agrees that such is warranted as \r\npart of the VA's duty to assist the veteran in developing \r\nevidence pertinent to his claim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A; \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.159.\r\n\r\nIn view of the foregoing, the case is remanded for the \r\nfollowing action:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should ask the veteran to \r\nidentify all sources of VA or non-VA \r\ntreatment for psychiatric problems since \r\n2001.  The RO should obtain copies of \r\nthe related medical records which are \r\nnot already on file.\r\n\r\n2.  The RO should give the veteran an \r\nopportunity to provide any further \r\ndetails of his claimed Vietnam \r\nstressors.  The RO should then ask CURR \r\nto attempt to verify the claimed \r\nstressors.  The RO should provide CURR \r\nwith a summary of claimed service \r\nstressors, copies of service personnel \r\nrecords, and any other documents needed \r\nby CURR to corroborate claimed \r\nstressors.  CURR should be asked to \r\nprovide any available histories of the \r\nveteran's unit during the time he was in \r\nVietnam.\r\n\r\n3.  Thereafter, the RO should have the \r\nveteran undergo a VA psychiatric \r\nexamination to determine the existence \r\nand etiology of any PTSD.  The claims \r\nfolder should be provided to and \r\nreviewed by the doctor.  Any diagnosis \r\nof PTSD should be in accordance with \r\nDSM-IV, and the doctor should identify \r\nthe stressors which are believed to be \r\nthe cause of the condition.\r\n\r\n4.  After assuring compliance with the \r\nnotice and duty to assist provisions of \r\nthe law, the RO should review the claim \r\nfor service connection for PTSD.  If the \r\nclaim is denied, the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative should be provided with a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case, and \r\ngiven an opportunity to respond, before \r\nthe case is returned to the Board.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence \r\nand argument on the matter the Board has remanded to the RO.  \r\nKutscherousky v.

See \r\n38 C.F.R. � 19.9(a)(2) (2002).  \r\n\r\nHowever, on May 1, 2003, the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor the Federal Circuit (\"Federal Circuit\") invalidated 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 19.9(a)(2), in Disabled American Veterans v. \r\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, 327 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. \r\n2003) (hereinafter \"DAV\").  The Federal Circuit held that 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 19.9(a)(2), in conjunction with the amended rule \r\ncodified at 38 C.F.R. � 20.1304, was inconsistent with 38 \r\nU.S.C. � 7104(a), because 38 C.F.R. � 19.9(a)(2), denies \r\nappellants \"one review on appeal to the Secretary\" when the \r\nBoard considers additional evidence without having to remand \r\nthe case to the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) for \r\ninitial consideration, and without having to obtain the \r\nappellant's waiver.  \r\n\r\nFollowing the Federal Circuit's decision in DAV, the General \r\nCounsel issued a precedential opinion, which concluded that \r\nDAV did not prohibit the Board from developing evidence in a \r\ncase before it, provided that the Board does not adjudicate \r\nthe claim based on any new evidence it obtains unless the \r\nclaimant waives initial consideration of such evidence by \r\nfirst-tier adjudicators in the Veterans Benefits \r\nAdministration (VBA).  VAOPGCPREC 1-03.  Based on this \r\nopinion, the Board continued, for a short time, to request \r\ndevelopment via the Board's EDU.  \r\n\r\nRecently, in light of the Federal Circuit Court's decision \r\nand other policy considerations, the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) determined that VBA would resume all \r\ndevelopment functions.  In other words, aside from the \r\nlimited class of development functions that the Board is \r\nstatutorily permitted to carry out, see 38 U.S.C.A. �� \r\n7107(b), 7109(a), all evidence development will be conducted \r\nat the regional office (RO) level.  \r\n\r\nIn the event that you appeared at a hearing before a \r\nVeterans Law Judge (VLJ) other than the VLJ signing this \r\nremand, be advised that if your case is returned to the \r\nBoard, it will be reassigned to the VLJ who conducted your \r\nhearing.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this matter is REMANDED to the RO for the \r\nfollowing:  \r\n\r\n1.  Conduct a PIES request for copies of the \r\nveteran's personnel files showing units of \r\nassignment, dates of assignment, participation in \r\ncombat operations, wounds received in action, \r\nawards and decorations and official travel outside \r\nthe continental United States.  Such records \r\nshould encompass the veteran's entire period of \r\nactive duty, from August 1965 until August 1967.  \r\n\r\n2.  Make a specific request to the \r\nUnited States Armed Services Center for \r\nResearch of Unit Records for the \r\nVeteran's Personnel Qualification \r\nRecord, DA Form 20.\r\n\r\n3.  After the development requested \r\nabove has been completed to the extent \r\npossible, the RO should again review the \r\nrecord.

Kauf, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nPreviously, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) \r\nordered further development in your case.  Thereafter, your \r\ncase was sent to the Board's Evidence Development Unit (EDU), \r\nto undertake the requested development.  \r\nPrior to May 1, 2003, the Board's regulations provided that \r\nif further evidence, clarification of the evidence, \r\ncorrection of a procedural defect, or any other action was \r\nessential for a proper appellate decision, a Board Member or \r\npanel of Members could direct Board personnel to undertake \r\nthe action essential for a proper appellate decision.  See 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 19.9(a)(2) (2002).  \r\n\r\nHowever, on May 1, 2003, the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor the Federal Circuit (\"Federal Circuit\") invalidated 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 19.9(a)(2), in Disabled American Veterans v. \r\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, 327 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2003) \r\n(hereinafter \"DAV\").  The Federal Circuit held that 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 19.9(a)(2), in conjunction with the amended rule \r\ncodified at 38 C.F.R. � 20.1304, was inconsistent with 38 \r\nU.S.C. � 7104(a), because 38 C.F.R. � 19.9(a)(2), denies \r\nappellants \"one review on appeal to the Secretary\" when the \r\nBoard considers additional evidence without having to remand \r\nthe case to the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) for \r\ninitial consideration, and without having to obtain the \r\nappellant's waiver.  \r\n\r\nFollowing the Federal Circuit's decision in DAV, the General \r\nCounsel issued a precedential opinion, which concluded that \r\nDAV did not prohibit the Board from developing evidence in a \r\ncase before it, provided that the Board does not adjudicate \r\nthe claim based on any new evidence it obtains unless the \r\nclaimant waives initial consideration of such evidence by \r\nfirst-tier adjudicators in the Veterans Benefits \r\nAdministration (VBA).  VAOPGCPREC 1-03.  Based on this \r\nopinion, the Board continued, for a short time, to request \r\ndevelopment via the Board's EDU.  \r\n\r\nRecently, in light of the Federal Circuit Court's decision \r\nand other policy considerations, the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) determined that VBA would resume all development \r\nfunctions.  In other words, aside from the limited class of \r\ndevelopment functions that the Board is statutorily permitted \r\nto carry out, see 38 U.S.C.A. �� 7107(b), 7109(a), all \r\nevidence development will be conducted at the regional office \r\n(RO) level.  \r\n\r\nIn the event that you appeared at a hearing before a Veterans \r\nLaw Judge (VLJ) other than the VLJ signing this remand, be \r\nadvised that if your case is returned to the Board, it will \r\nbe reassigned to the VLJ who conducted your hearing.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this matter is REMANDED to the RO for the \r\nfollowing:  \r\n\r\n1.  Make arrangements with the \r\nappropriate VA medical facility for the \r\nveteran's claims file to be returned to \r\nthe January 2003 examiner, if available, \r\nfor clarification of the provided \r\nopinion.  The examiner should be \r\nrequested to reconcile his opinion with \r\nthe other medical evidence of record, \r\nincluding the September 1977 VA \r\nexamination finding of moderate anxiety \r\nneurosis, the September 1983 VA \r\nexamination findings of PTSD and organic \r\nbrain syndrome due to head trauma mixed \r\nwith anxiety disorder, the July 1993 VA \r\nexamination finding of generalized \r\nanxiety disorder with symptoms of PTSD, \r\nthe June 1994 VA examination findings of \r\nPTSD, and the private medical opinions of \r\nJ.R.S., M. Div., M.S. Ed., dated \r\nMay 1992, January 1993, June 1993, and \r\nNovember 1997.  The examiner should also \r\nbe requested to provide information as to \r\nhis expertise in the field of psychiatry \r\n(i.e. board certification, etc.).  Any \r\nadditional examinations or psychological \r\ntesting should be conducted as necessary \r\nfor an adequate opinion.  If the January \r\n2003 examiner is unavailable, the veteran \r\nshould be provided an additional \r\nexamination by a VA psychiatrist.\r\n\r\n2.  After the development requested above \r\nhas been completed to the extent \r\npossible, the RO should again review the \r\nrecord.  If any benefit sought on appeal \r\nremains denied, the appellant and \r\nrepresentative, if any, should be \r\nfurnished a supplemental statement of the \r\ncase and given the opportunity to respond \r\nthereto.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the case should be returned to the Board, if in \r\norder.  The Board intimates no opinion as to the ultimate \r\noutcome of this case.  The appellant need take no action \r\nunless otherwise notified.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded to \r\nthe regional office.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 \r\n(1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment by the RO.  \r\nThe law requires that all claims that are remanded by the \r\nBoard of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or \r\nother appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious \r\nmanner.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' \r\nAppeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2002 rating decision \r\nby the Hartford, Connecticut, Department of Veterans Affairs \r\n(VA) Regional Office (RO).\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that that he currently suffers from PTSD \r\nas a result of his combat experiences in Vietnam.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran's DD Form 214 notes that he served on active duty \r\nin the Army from March 1963 to March 1965.  In addition, the \r\nveteran has stated that he had additional service in the Army \r\nfrom March 1965 to March 1966, and specifically stated that \r\nhe participated in combat operations while on active duty in \r\nVietnam from September 1965 to March 1966.  \r\n\r\nThe evidence of record includes a June 1979 statement from \r\nthe veteran's Congressman, which indicates that the veteran \r\nserved in the Army Reserves from March 1965 to March 1969.  \r\nThe evidence of record also includes numerous buddy \r\nstatements, which indicate that the veteran served in Vietnam \r\nin the 1st Cavalry Division and the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry \r\nDivision, Bravo Company, in 1965.  \r\n\r\nTo date, the service department has not been able to verify \r\nthe veteran's alleged active duty in Vietnam.  In the Board's \r\nopinion further development is in order to determine if the \r\nveteran did in fact serve in Vietnam.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n5103A (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.203 (2003) .\r\n\r\nThe Board regrets any further delay in this case.  However, \r\nfor the reasons noted above, the Board concludes that \r\nadditional development of the record is required prior to \r\nappellate disposition.  Accordingly, the case is REMANDED  to \r\nthe RO via the Appeals Management Center, in Washington, \r\nD.C., for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should arrange for a field \r\ninvestigator to contact the persons who \r\npurportedly have provided statements \r\nattesting to the veteran's service in \r\nVietnam and determine if the statements \r\nwere in fact made by the identified \r\nauthors.  \r\n\r\n2.  If indicated, the RO should request \r\nthe appropriate service department to \r\nverify all periods of the veteran's \r\nservice, including all service in the \r\nArmy Reserves and any periods of ACDUTRA.  \r\nIn addition, the RO should arrange for an \r\nexhaustive search for all service \r\npersonnel records for the veteran during \r\nall periods of service, including \r\nACDUTRA, to include military occupational \r\nspecialty, decorations awarded, unit \r\nassignments and duty locations.  The \r\nefforts to obtain such records should be \r\ndocumented.\r\n\r\n3.  The RO should then undertake any \r\nother development required to comply with \r\nthe VCAA and implementing regulations.\r\n\r\n4.  Thereafter, the RO should \r\nreadjudicate the issue of entitlement to \r\nservice connection for PTSD.  If the \r\nbenefit sought on appeal is not granted \r\nto the veteran's satisfaction, the \r\nveteran and his representative must be \r\nfurnished a supplemental statement of the \r\ncase and be given the appropriate time \r\nperiod to respond before the claims \r\nfolder is returned to the Board for \r\nfurther appellate consideration.\r\n\r\nBy this remand, the Board intimates no opinion as to any \r\nfinal outcome warranted.  The appellant need take no action \r\nuntil otherwise notified, but he may furnish additional \r\nevidence and argument during the appropriate time frame.  See \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999); Colon v. \r\nBrown, 9 Vet. App. 104, 108 (1996); Booth v. Brown, 8 Vet. \r\nApp. 109 (1995); Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet.

Carpenter, Attorney\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nD. Dean, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant served on active duty from June to December \r\n1975.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) from a July 1990 rating determination by the Roanoke, \r\nVirginia, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA).  \r\n\r\nThe Board denied the present appeal in a decision entered in \r\nApril 1998.  Subsequently, an appeal was initiated to the U. \r\nS. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), and in an \r\nOrder dated in October 2000, the Court vacated the Board's \r\nApril 1998 decision and remanded the appeal to the Board for \r\nfurther development.  The Court did not retain jurisdiction \r\nover this matter.  \r\n\r\nIn August 2001, the Board remanded the appeal to the RO for \r\nfurther development consistent with the Court's Order and in \r\norder to  comply with the newly enacted requirements of the \r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. \r\nNo. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000).  The case has now been \r\nreturned to the Board by the RO.  \r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn the August 2001 remand, the Board requested that the RO \r\nobtain a medical opinion concerning the etiology of any \r\npsychiatric disability found to exist.  A comprehensive \r\npsychiatric examination and evaluation by a VA staff \r\npsychiatrist in April 2003 resulted in the medical opinion \r\nthat the appellant does not meet the diagnostic criteria for \r\nPTSD, but rather currently suffers from alcohol dependence, \r\npolysubstance abuse, antisocial and borderline personality \r\ndisorders, and a history of depressive disorder, with a \r\nworking diagnosis of dysthymic disorder.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the VA examiner in April 2003 did not provide \r\nthe requested opinion concerning the etiology of the \r\nappellant's diagnosed dysthymic disorder, and more \r\nspecifically whether that acquired psychiatric disability is \r\netiologically related to the appellant's military service.  \r\nConsequently, the Board must view the April 2003 VA \r\nexamination report as inadequate to fully satisfy the August \r\n2001 remand.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 \r\n(1998).  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the appellant's attorney has argued that the RO \r\nhas failed to fully comply with its duties pursuant to \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) and especially under 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.159(b) to ask the appellant to submit \"any evidence in \r\nthe claimant's possession that pertains to the claim.\"  \r\nMoreover, once all appropriate development has been \r\ncompleted, the RO should then adjudicate the claim on a de \r\nnovo basis.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a).  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, this appeal is remanded to the RO (via the \r\nAppeals Management Center in Washington, D.C.) for the \r\nfollowing further actions:  \r\n\r\n1.  The RO should issue a letter to the \r\nappellant providing him with the notice \r\nrequired under 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) and \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b), to include a \r\nrequest that the appellant submit any \r\npertinent evidence in his possession.  \r\n\r\n2.  The RO should take appropriate steps \r\nto obtain a copy of any pertinent \r\nevidence identified but not provided by \r\nthe appellant.  \r\n\r\n3.  If the RO is unable to obtain a copy \r\nof any pertinent evidence identified by \r\nthe appellant, it should so inform the \r\nappellant and his representative and \r\nrequest them to provide a copy of the \r\noutstanding evidence.  \r\n\r\n4.  After all appropriate development has \r\nbeen completed, the RO should return the \r\nclaims files to the VA psychiatrist who \r\nexamined the appellant in April 2003.  \r\nThe psychiatrist should be requested to \r\nprovide an addendum addressing any \r\npertinent evidence received since his \r\ncompletion of the examination report and \r\nalso providing an opinion as to whether \r\nit is likely, less likely than not, or as \r\nlikely as not that the veteran's \r\ndysthymic disorder is etiologically \r\nrelated to the his military service.  The \r\nrationale for all opinions expressed \r\nshould also be provided.  \r\n\r\n5.  If the April 2003 VA examiner is no \r\nlonger available, the RO should schedule \r\nthe appellant for another VA psychiatric \r\nexamination by a psychiatrist to \r\ndetermine the nature and etiology of any \r\npsychiatric disorders present.  This \r\nexaminer must review the complete claims \r\nfiles before completing the examination \r\nreport.  Any studies, tests and \r\nevaluations deemed necessary should be \r\nperformed.  A diagnosis of PTSD under the \r\nDSM-IV criteria should be made or ruled \r\nout.  If PTSD is diagnosed, the examiner \r\nshould identify the specific stressor(s) \r\nsupporting the diagnosis.  If PTSD is not \r\ndiagnosed, the examiner should explain \r\nwhy the veteran does not meet the \r\ncriteria for this diagnosis.  If the \r\nappellant is found to have any other \r\nacquired psychiatric disorder(s), the \r\nexaminer should provide a medical opinion \r\nwith respect to each such disorder as to \r\nwhether it is likely, less likely than \r\nnot, or as likely as not that the \r\nacquired psychiatric disorder is \r\netiologically related to the appellant's \r\nmilitary service.  The rationale for all \r\nopinions expressed should also be \r\nprovided.  \r\n\r\n6.  The RO should then adjudicate the \r\ncurrent claim on a de novo basis without \r\nreference to prior adjudications.  \r\n\r\nIf any benefits sought on appeal are not granted to the \r\nappellant's satisfaction, the appellant and his \r\nrepresentative should be furnished an appropriate \r\nsupplemental statement of the case and provided the requisite \r\nopportunity to respond.  In accordance with proper appellate \r\nprocedures, the case should then be returned to the Board for \r\nfurther appellate consideration.  The appellant need take no \r\nfurther action until he is otherwise informed, but he may \r\nfurnish additional evidence and argument on the remanded \r\nmatter while the case is in remand status.  See \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).  \r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment by the RO.  \r\nThe law requires that all claims that are remanded by the \r\nBoard of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or \r\nother appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious \r\nmanner.  See The Veterans' Benefits Improvements Act of 1994, \r\nPub. L. No. 103-446, � 302, 108 Stat. 4645, 4658 (1994), \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5101 (West 2002) (Historical and Statutory \r\nNotes).

The Board additionally \r\nnotes that the appellant, in his September 2002 \r\ncorrespondence, indicated that his current residence was in \r\nIndiana.  Accordingly, the claims file as well as \r\njurisdiction was transferred to the Indianapolis Regional \r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nThe appellant requested a Decision Review Officer (DRO) \r\nhearing in this case, which was conducted in March 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe appellant is not a veteran of combat, and he did not \r\nexperience a verified stressor event.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for entitlement to service connection for post-\r\ntraumatic stress disorder are not met.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, \r\n5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3.304(f) (2003).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  Veterans Claims Assistance Act\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 \r\n(VCAA), codified at 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107 \r\n(West 2002), and its implementing regulations, codified at \r\n38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326 (2003), are \r\napplicable to the appellant's claim of entitlement to service \r\nconnection for PTSD.  This law redefines the obligations of \r\nVA with respect to the duty to assist and includes an \r\nenhanced duty to notify a claimant as to the information and \r\nevidence necessary to substantiate a claim for VA benefits.\r\n\r\nFirst, VA has a duty to notify the appellant and his \r\nrepresentative of any information and evidence needed to \r\nsubstantiate and complete a claim.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5102, 5103 \r\n(West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) (2003).  Information means \r\nnon-evidentiary facts, such as the claimant's address and \r\nSocial Security number or the name and address of a medical \r\ncare provider who may have evidence pertinent to the claim.  \r\nSee 66 Fed. Reg. 45620, 45630 (August 29, 2001); 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.159(a)(5) (2003).  Second, VA has a duty to assist the \r\nappellant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the \r\nclaim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c) \r\n(2003).\r\n\r\nThe record indicates that the appellant has been fully \r\napprised of what evidence would be necessary to substantiate \r\nthe claims, as well as informed of the specific assignment of \r\nresponsibility for obtaining such evidence.  38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n5103(a); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  \r\nThe August 2000 rating decision on appeal, the statement of \r\nthe case (SOC), supplemental statements of the case (SSOC's), \r\nand multiple supplemental correspondence, together have \r\nadequately informed the appellant of the types of evidence \r\nneeded to substantiate his claim.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant was advised of the evidence which would \r\nsubstantiate his claim, and the responsibility for obtaining \r\nit, by letter dated in January 2000.  The letter informed the \r\nappellant what evidence and information VA would be obtaining \r\nas well as the evidence that the appellant needed to provide.  \r\nThe letter explained that VA would make reasonable efforts to \r\nhelp him get evidence such as medical records, employment \r\nrecords, etc., but that he was responsible for providing \r\nsufficient information to VA to identify the custodian of any \r\nrecords.  The Board additionally notes that the January 2000 \r\nduty to assist letter informed the appellant of the legal \r\nelements of a service connection claim in general as well as \r\na PTSD claim specifically.\r\n\r\nIn specific compliance with Quartuccio, in February 2001, \r\nOctober 2002, and July 2003, the RO sent letters to the \r\nappellant explaining the recent enactment of the VCAA and its \r\napplication to his claim of entitlement to service connection \r\nfor PTSD.  These letters reiterated what evidence and \r\ninformation VA would be obtaining as well as the evidence \r\nthat the appellant needed to provide.  These letters not only \r\ninformed the appellant of the legal requirements for service \r\nconnection, but they also informed him of the evidence \r\nnecessary to substantiate his claim for PTSD.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the timing of the VCAA notification, the \r\nBoard notes that the initial adjudication of the appellant's \r\nclaim took place in August 2000, or prior to the February \r\n2001, October 2002, and July 2003 VCAA notification letters.  \r\nRecent case law suggests that VCAA notice, as required by \r\n38 U.S.C. � 5103(a), must be provided to a claimant before \r\nthe initial unfavorable agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) \r\ndecision on a claim for VA benefits.  Pelegrini v. Principi, \r\n17 Vet. App. 412 (2004).  Although the timing of the VCAA \r\nnotification in this case does not comply with the explicit \r\nrequirements of Pelegrini, the Court did not address whether, \r\nand if so, how, the Secretary can properly cure a defect in \r\nthe timing of the VCAA notice.  Furthermore, the Court left \r\nopen the possibility that a notice error of this kind may be \r\nnon-prejudicial to a claimant.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Court in Pelegrini found, on the one hand, \r\nthat the failure to provide the notice until after a claimant \r\nhas already received an initial unfavorable AOJ \r\ndetermination, i.e., a denial of the claim, would largely \r\nnullify the purpose of the notice and, as such, prejudice the \r\nclaimant by forcing him or her to overcome an adverse \r\ndecision, as well as substantially impair the orderly \r\nsequence of claims development and adjudication.  Id. at 422.  \r\nConversely, the Court acknowledged that the Secretary could \r\nshow that the lack of a pre-AOJ decision notice was not \r\nprejudicial to the appellant.  Id. (\"The Secretary has \r\nfailed to demonstrate that, in this case, lack of such a pre-\r\nAOJ-decision notice was not prejudicial to the appellant.\")\r\n\r\nThe Court in Pelegrini appears to have left open the \r\npossibility of a notice error being found to be non-\r\nprejudicial to a claimant - a contrary finding would require \r\nthe Board to remand every case for the purpose of having the \r\nAOJ provide a pre-initial adjudication notice.  Furthermore, \r\nproviding such a notice would mandate all prior adjudications \r\nbe vacated, as well as nullifying the notice of disagreement \r\nand substantive appeal that were filed by the appellant to \r\nperfect the appeal to the Board.  Such interpretation of \r\nsection 5103(a) is incompatible with the best interests of \r\nthe appellant, as it would result in a substantial delay in \r\nreadjudicating his claim.  Therefore, consistent with the \r\nrequirements of the VCAA, the appellant was afforded the \r\nopportunity to submit information and evidence in support of \r\nhis claim.  Thus, all due process concerns have been \r\nsatisfied.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384 (1993); \r\nSutton v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 553 (1996); see also 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 20.1102 (2003) (harmless error).\r\n\r\nThe VCAA notification letters are legally sufficient.  See \r\nParalyzed Veterans of America, et. al. v. Secretary of \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (PVA), Nos. 02-7007, -7008, -\r\n7009, -7010 (Fed. Cir. September 22, 2003); Disabled American \r\nVeterans, et. al. v. Secretary of Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (DAV), 327 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  The Federal \r\nCircuit has held that 38 C.F.R. �� 3.159(b)(1) \r\nand 19.9(a)(2)(ii) are invalid to the extent they provide a \r\nclaimant \"not less than 30 days\" to respond to a VCAA \r\nnotification letter because the regulations are contrary to \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(b), which provides a claimant one year to \r\nsubmit evidence.  However, the statute was recently amended \r\nto permit VA to adjudicate a claim within one-year of receipt \r\nof the claim.  Veterans Benefits Act of 2003, Pub. L. No. \r\n108-183, 117 Stat. 2651 (Dec. 16, 2003).  Therefore, the \r\nclaimant was notified properly of his statutory rights.\r\n\r\nWith respect to VA's duty to assist the appellant, the RO \r\nrequested and obtained the appellant's service medical and \r\npersonnel records from the National Personnel Records Center \r\n(NPRC).  The record also includes VA medical records, private \r\nmedical records, DRO hearing transcript, and the appellant's \r\nown contentions.  Accordingly, VA has no outstanding duty to \r\nassist the appellant in obtaining any additional information \r\nor evidence.  At every stage of the process, the appellant \r\nwas informed of the information needed to substantiate his \r\nclaim, and VA has obtained all evidence identified by the \r\nappellant.  The Board finds that all indicated medical \r\nrecords have been obtained and the appellant has not \r\nreferenced any outstanding records or information that he \r\nwanted VA to obtain.\r\n\r\nThe duty to assist also includes providing a medical \r\nexamination or obtaining a medical opinion when such is \r\nnecessary to make a decision on the claim.  An examination or \r\nopinion is necessary if the evidence of record:  (A) contains \r\ncompetent evidence that the claimant has a current \r\ndisability, or persistent or recurrent symptoms of \r\ndisability; (B) establishes that the claimant suffered an \r\nevent, injury or disease in service; and (C) indicates that \r\nthe claimed disability or symptoms may be associated with the \r\nestablished event, injury, or disease in service or with \r\nanother service-connected disability, but (D) does not \r\ncontain sufficient medical evidence for the Secretary to make \r\na decision on the claim.  38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(4) (2003).\r\n\r\nThe appellant in this case was not previously afforded a VA \r\nexamination with respect to the issue on appeal.  As \r\ndiscussed in further detail below, the evidence shows that \r\nthe appellant is currently diagnosed with PTSD; however, the \r\nevidence does not show a verified in-service stressor or a \r\nlink between the in-service stressor and the appellant's \r\ncurrent PTSD.  Therefore, in the absence of such evidence the \r\nduty to assist does not require the appellant be afforded a \r\nVA examination in this case.\r\n\r\nThus, the record indicates that VA has done everything \r\nreasonably possible to assist the appellant.  In the \r\ncircumstances of this case, additional efforts to assist him \r\nin accordance with the VCAA would serve no useful purpose.  \r\nSee Soyini v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 (1991) (strict \r\nadherence to requirements in the law does not dictate an \r\nunquestioning, blind adherence in the face of overwhelming \r\nevidence in support of the result in a particular case; such \r\nadherence would result in unnecessarily imposing additional \r\nburdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the veteran); \r\nSabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (remands which \r\nwould only result in unnecessarily imposing additional \r\nburdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the veteran are to \r\nbe avoided).  VA has satisfied its duties to inform and \r\nassist the appellant at every stage of this case.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  Service Connection for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \r\n(PTSD)\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � \r\n4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between \r\ncurrent symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor \r\noccurred. 38 C.F.R. �� 3.304(f) and 4.125 (requiring PTSD \r\ndiagnoses to conform to the criteria in the DIAGNOSTIC AND \r\nSTATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS (4th ed. 1994) (DSM-\r\nIV)).\r\n\r\nWith regard to the second PTSD element, that of an in-service \r\nstressor, the evidence necessary to establish that the \r\nclaimed stressor actually varies depending on whether it can \r\nbe determined that the veteran \"engaged in combat with the \r\nenemy.\" 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. 3.304(d). If it is \r\ndetermined through military citation or other supportive \r\nevidence that a veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, and \r\nthe claimed stressors are related to combat, the veteran's \r\nlay testimony regarding the reported stressors must be \r\naccepted as conclusive evidence as to their actual occurrence \r\nand no further development or corroborative evidence will be \r\nnecessary. 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nWhere a determination is made that the veteran did not \r\n\"engage in combat with the enemy,\" or the claimed stressor is \r\nnot related to combat, the veteran's lay testimony alone will \r\nnot be enough to establish the occurrence of the alleged \r\nstressor.  See Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395 (1996); \r\nDizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 166 (1996). In such \r\ncases, the record must contain service records or other \r\nstatements as to the occurrence of the claimed stressor. See \r\nWest (Carlton) v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 70, 76 (1994); Zarycki \r\nv. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 (1993). \r\n\r\nOnce independent verification of the stressor event has been \r\nsubmitted, the veteran's personal exposure to the event may \r\nbe implied by the evidence of record. A veteran need not \r\nsubstantiate his actual presence during the stressor event; \r\nthe fact that the veteran was assigned to and stationed with \r\na unit that was present while such an event occurred may \r\nstrongly suggest that he was, in fact, exposed to the \r\nstressor event. See Pentecost v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 124 \r\n(2002); Suozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307 (1997).\r\n\r\nIt is upon the third prong of a successful claim of service \r\nconnection for PTSD (i.e., that of a verified stressor) that \r\nthe appellant's claim fails.\r\n\r\nThe record in this matter does not reveal that the appellant \r\nis a veteran of combat.  His report of separation from the \r\nArmed Forces indicates that the appellant's military \r\noccupational specialty was an \"asphalt sp[ecialist],\" which \r\nis not a speciality presumed to be indicative of combat \r\nservice.  The appellant's enlisted qualification record \r\nfurther indicates that for the entirety of his service in \r\nVietnam, he served as a \"quarry machine operator,\" \r\n\"powerman,\" and asphalt distributor operator - none of \r\nthese positions involving combat qualification or service.   \r\n\r\nSimilarly, the appellant's awards and decorations are not \r\nsupportive of a finding of combat veteran status. The \r\nNational Defense Service Medal awarded to the appellant is \r\nawarded for honorable active service for any period between \r\nJune 27, 1950 and July 27, 1954, or between January 1, 1961 \r\nand August 14, 1974.  See Manual of Military Decorations and \r\nAwards, 6-1 (Department of Defense Manual 1348.33-M, July \r\n1990).  \r\n\r\nThe Vietnam Service Medal is awarded to all members of the \r\nArmed Forces of the United States serving at any time between \r\nJuly 4, 1965 and March 28, 1973 in Thailand, Laos, or \r\nCambodia or the airspaces thereover in direct support of \r\noperations in Vietnam.  Id. at 6-1.  An award of a Bronze \r\nService Star for the Vietnam Service Medal is based upon \r\n\"participation during\" approved campaign periods.\"  Id. at \r\n6-6.  The appellant is not shown to have received the Bronze \r\nService Star.  \r\n\r\nThe Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal is awarded to those \r\npersonnel who (1) served in the Republic of Vietnam for 6 \r\nmonths during a specified period; or, (2) served outside the \r\ngeographical limits of the Republic of Vietnam but \r\ncontributed direct combat support to the Republic of Vietnam \r\nand Armed Forces for 6 months; or, (3) served in the Republic \r\nof Vietnam or outside its geographical limits for less than 6 \r\nmonths but were wounded, captured or killed.  See Army \r\nRegulation 672-5-1, 28.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant's military personnel records do not \r\nsubstantiate that he is a veteran of combat.  Further, \r\nresearch by the RO as to the appellant's claimed experiences \r\nin Vietnam has failed to substantiate such status.   \r\n\r\nIn a September 1999 PTSD questionnaire, the appellant stated \r\nthat he witnessed a sergeant being killed and that he \r\nassisted in cleaning up the area and getting the remains out \r\nafter a mortar attack on a Quonset hut.  The appellant has \r\nalso reported that he witnessed three young girls being shot \r\nand killed by enemy forces.  \r\n\r\nIn August 2001, the appellant's account, and clarifying \r\ninformation as to his service assignment was forwarded to the \r\nU.S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records \r\n(USASCRUR) for a search of substantiating information.  Later \r\nthat month, the agency requested that the RO forward it \r\nadditional information.  In April 2002, the RO provided \r\nadditional details from the appellant, and resubmitted its \r\nrequest to USASCRUR.  In June 2002, the agency reported that \r\nit could not substantiate the appellant's claimed stressors.  \r\nAdditionally, in February 2004, the National Association of \r\nRecords and Archives reported that it could not substantiate \r\nthe appellant's account.     \r\n\r\nAlthough the appellant was notified on several occasions to \r\nprovide a more detailed description of the claimed in-service \r\nstressor event(s), he did not provide the name of the \r\ndeceased sergeant nor the specific dates of the incidents \r\nwhich he claimed as stressors.  Thus, because the appellant \r\nis not shown to be a veteran of combat and no claimed \r\nstressor has been substantiated, his claim fails on this \r\nbasis.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress \r\ndisorder (PTSD) is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t                        \r\n____________________________________________\r\n\tVITO A. CLEMENTI\r\n\tActing Veterans Law Judge, Board of Veterans' Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Department of Veterans Affairs\r\n\r\nYOUR RIGHTS TO APPEAL OUR DECISION\r\n\r\nThe attached decision by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) is \r\nthe final decision for all issues addressed in the \"Order\" section of the \r\ndecision.  The Board may also choose to remand an issue or issues to the \r\nlocal VA office for additional development.   If the Board did this in your \r\ncase, then a \"Remand\" section follows the \"Order.\"  However, you cannot \r\nappeal an issue remanded to the local VA office because a remand is not a \r\nfinal decision. The advice below on how to appeal a claim applies only to \r\nissues that were allowed, denied, or dismissed in the \"Order.\"\r\nIf you are satisfied with the outcome of your appeal, you do not need to do \r\nanything.  We will return your file to your local VA office to implement \r\nthe BVA's decision.  However, if you are not satisfied with the Board's \r\ndecision on any or all of the issues allowed, denied, or dismissed, you \r\nhave the following options, which are listed in no particular order of \r\nimportance: \r\n?\tAppeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \r\n(Court)\r\n?\tFile with the Board a motion for reconsideration of this decision\r\n?\tFile with the Board a motion to vacate this decision \r\n?\tFile with the Board a motion for revision of this decision based on \r\nclear and unmistakable error. \r\nAlthough it would not affect this BVA decision, you may choose to also: \r\n?\tReopen your claim at the local VA office by submitting new and \r\nmaterial evidence. \r\nThere is no time limit for filing a motion for reconsideration, a motion to \r\nvacate, or a motion for revision based on clear and unmistakable error with \r\nthe Board, or a claim to reopen at the local VA office.  None of these \r\nthings is mutually exclusive - you can do all five things at the same time \r\nif you wish.  However, if you file a Notice of Appeal with the Court and a \r\nmotion with the Board at the same time, this may delay your case because of \r\njurisdictional conflicts. If you file a Notice of Appeal with the Court \r\nbefore you file a motion with the BVA, the BVA will not be able to consider \r\nyour motion without the Court's permission. \r\n\r\nHow long do I have to start my appeal to the Court?  You have 120 days from \r\nthe date this decision was mailed to you (as shown on the first page of \r\nthis decision) to file a Notice of Appeal with the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims.  If you also want to file a motion for \r\nreconsideration or a motion to vacate, you will still have time to appeal \r\nto the Court.  As long as you file your motion(s) with the Board within 120 \r\ndays of the date this decision was mailed to you, you will then have \r\nanother 120 days from the date the BVA decides the motion for \r\nreconsideration or the motion to vacate to appeal to the Court.  You should \r\nknow that even if you have a representative, as discussed below, it is your \r\nresponsibility to make sure that your appeal to Court is filed on time.\r\n\r\nHow do I appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims?  \r\nSend your Notice of Appeal to the Court at:\r\n\r\nClerk, U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\r\n625 Indiana Avenue, NW, Suite 900\r\nWashington, DC 20004-2950\r\n\r\nYou can get information about the Notice of Appeal, the procedure for \r\nfiling a Notice of Appeal, the filing fee (or a motion to waive the filing \r\nfee if payment would cause financial hardship), and other matters covered \r\nby the Court's rules directly from the Court. You can also get this \r\ninformation from the Court's web site on the Internet at \r\nwww.vetapp.uscourts.gov, and you can download forms directly from that \r\nwebsite.  The Court's facsimile number is (202) 501-5848. \r\n\r\nTo ensure full protection of your right of appeal to the Court, you must \r\nfile your Notice of Appeal with the Court, not with the Board, or any other \r\nVA office. \r\n\r\nHow do I file a motion for reconsideration? You can file a motion asking \r\nthe BVA to reconsider any part of this decision by writing a letter to the \r\nBVA stating why you believe that the BVA committed an obvious error of fact \r\nor law in this decision, or stating that new and material military service \r\nrecords have been discovered that apply to your appeal. If the BVA has \r\ndecided more than one issue, be sure to tell us which issue(s) you want \r\nreconsidered. Send your letter to: \r\nDirector, Management and Administration (014)\r\nBoard of Veterans' Appeals\r\n810 Vermont Avenue, NW\r\nWashington, DC 20420\r\n\r\nVA \r\nFORM\r\nJUN \r\n2003 \r\n(RS) \r\n \r\n4597\r\nPage \r\n1\r\nCONTINUED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember, the Board places no time limit on filing a motion for \r\nreconsideration, and you can do this at any time. However, if you also plan \r\nto appeal this decision to the Court, you must file your motion within 120 \r\ndays from the date of this decision. \r\n\r\nHow do I file a motion to vacate? You can file a motion asking the BVA to \r\nvacate any part of this decision by writing a letter to the BVA stating why \r\nyou believe you were denied due process of law during your appeal. For \r\nexample, you were denied your right to representation through action or \r\ninaction by VA personnel, you were not provided a Statement of the Case or \r\nSupplemental Statement of the Case, or you did not get a personal hearing \r\nthat you requested. You can also file a motion to vacate any part of this \r\ndecision on the basis that the Board allowed benefits based on false or \r\nfraudulent evidence.  Send this motion to the address above for the \r\nDirector, Management and Administration, at the Board.  Remember, the Board \r\nplaces no time limit on filing a motion to vacate, and you can do this at \r\nany time. However, if you also plan to appeal this decision to the Court, \r\nyou must file your motion within 120 days from the date of this decision. \r\n\r\nHow do I file a motion to revise the Board's decision on the basis of clear \r\nand unmistakable error? You can file a motion asking that the Board revise \r\nthis decision if you believe that the decision is based on \"clear and \r\nunmistakable error\" (CUE).  Send this motion to the address above for the \r\nDirector, Management and Administration, at the Board. You should be \r\ncareful when preparing such a motion because it must meet specific \r\nrequirements, and the Board will not review a final decision on this basis \r\nmore than once. You should carefully review the Board's Rules of Practice \r\non CUE, 38 C.F.R. 20.1400 -- 20.1411, and seek help from a qualified \r\nrepresentative before filing such a motion. See discussion on \r\nrepresentation below. Remember, the Board places no time limit on filing a \r\nCUE review motion, and you can do this at any time. \r\n\r\nHow do I reopen my claim? You can ask your local VA office to reopen your \r\nclaim by simply sending them a statement indicating that you want to reopen \r\nyour claim.  However, to be successful in reopening your claim, you must \r\nsubmit new and material evidence to that office. See 38 C.F.R. 3.156(a). \r\n\r\nCan someone represent me in my appeal?  Yes. You can always represent \r\nyourself in any claim before VA, including the BVA, but you can also \r\nappoint someone to represent you.  An accredited representative of a \r\nrecognized service organization may represent you free of charge.  VA \r\napproves these organizations to help veterans, service members, and \r\ndependents prepare their claims and present them to VA. An accredited \r\nrepresentative works for the service organization and knows how to prepare \r\nand present claims. You can find a listing of these organizations on the \r\nInternet at: www.va.gov/vso.  You can also choose to be represented by a \r\nprivate attorney or by an \"agent.\" (An agent is a person who is not a \r\nlawyer, but is specially accredited by VA.) \r\n\r\nIf you want someone to represent you before the Court, rather than before \r\nVA, then you can get information on how to do so by writing directly to the \r\nCourt.  Upon request, the Court will provide you with a state-by-state \r\nlisting of persons admitted to practice before the Court who have indicated \r\ntheir availability to represent appellants.  This information is also \r\nprovided on the Court's website at www.vetapp.uscourts.gov. \r\n\r\nDo I have to pay an attorney or agent to represent me?  Except for a claim \r\ninvolving a home or small business VA loan under Chapter 37 of title 38, \r\nUnited States Code, attorneys or agents cannot charge you a fee or accept \r\npayment for services they provide before the date BVA makes a final \r\ndecision on your appeal. If you hire an attorney or accredited agent within \r\n1 year of a final BVA decision, then the attorney or agent is allowed to \r\ncharge you a fee for representing you before VA in most situations.  An \r\nattorney can also charge you for representing you before the Court.

Moran, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from April 1962 to January \r\n1966.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a February 1999 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico.  During the course of the appeal the \r\nveteran's claims file has been transferred to the Atlanta, \r\nGeorgia RO due to the veteran's change of address.  \r\n\r\nThis case was remanded by the Board in October 2001 for \r\nadditional development to include compliance with \r\nnotification of VCAA.  The case is once more before the Board \r\nfor appellate consideration.  \r\n\r\nOn May 27, 2004, the Board received a letter from the veteran \r\nwhich was forwarded from the RO.  The veteran appeared to \r\nnote his disagreement to an unspecified action by the RO.  \r\nTherefore, such matter is referred to the RO for \r\nclarification and any formal adjudicatory action deemed \r\nnecessary. \r\n\r\nThis appeal is Remanded to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, D.C.  VA will notify you if \r\nfurther action is required on your part.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment by the \r\nVeterans Benefits Administration (VBA) AMC.  The law requires \r\nthat all claims that are remanded by the Board or the United \r\nStates Court of Veteran Appeals (CAVC) for additional \r\ndevelopment or other appropriate action must be handled in an \r\nexpeditious manner.  See The Veterans' Benefits Improvements \r\nAct of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-446, � 302, 108 Stat. 4645, 4658 \r\n(1994).  38 U.S.C.A. � 5101 (West 2002) (Historical and \r\nStatutory Notes).  \r\n\r\nIn addition, VBA's Adjudication Procedure Manual, M21-1, Part \r\nIV, directs the ROs (or VBA AMC) to provide expeditious \r\nhandling of all cases that have been remanded by the Board \r\nand the CAVC.  See M21-1, Part IV, paras. 8.43 and 38.02.\r\n\r\nA preliminary review of the evidence shows that the issue on \r\nappeal remains unresolved, clinically.  See Colvin v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 174 (1991).\r\n\r\nThe veteran's complete service personnel/administrative \r\nrecords (201 file) should be obtained for appellate \r\nconsideration.  \r\n\r\nThe record contains a December 1998 private medical statement \r\nfrom S.J.P., Ph.D., and D.K., M.D., referring to treatment \r\nfor PTSD at Health Centers of Northern New Mexico.\r\n\r\nAlso of record is an April 2003 private medical statement, \r\nfrom D.P., M.D., that refers to ongoing treatment for PTSD at \r\nGeorgia Pines Community MH/DD/AD Services from staff mental \r\nhealth physicians and the community support team.   \r\n\r\nThe pertinent treatment records cited above from Health \r\nCenters of Northern New Mexico and Georgia Pines remain \r\noutstanding and should be obtained for the record as they may \r\ncontain information helpful to the veteran's claim.  Bell v. \r\nDerwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611, 613 (1992).\r\n\r\nAlso, the Board believes that the veteran is entitled to an \r\nadditional opportunity to identify a stressful in-service \r\nexperience and, if the experience is independently confirmed, \r\na VA psychiatric examination to determine whether the veteran \r\nhas PTSD caused by a confirmed stressor experience.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the VA has met its duty to assist the claimant \r\nin developing the facts pertinent to the claim and to ensure \r\nfull compliance with due process requirements, the case is \r\nREMANDED to the VBA AMC for the following development:\r\n\r\n1.  The veteran has the right to submit \r\nadditional evidence and argument on the \r\nmatters that the Board has remanded to \r\nthe VBA AMC.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 \r\nVet. App. 369 (1999). \r\n\r\nIn this regard, the veteran should be \r\nrequested to identify the names, \r\naddresses, and approximate dates of \r\ntreatment of all medical care providers, \r\nVA and non- VA, inpatient and outpatient, \r\nwho may possess additional records \r\npertaining to his treatment for PTSD from \r\nseparation from active duty in January \r\n1966 to the present.  After obtaining any \r\nnecessary authorization or medical \r\nreleases, the RO should request and \r\nassociate with the claims file legible \r\ncopies of the veteran's complete \r\ntreatment reports from those sources \r\nidentified by him whose records have not \r\npreviously been secured.  Specifically, \r\nall necessary arrangements should be made \r\nto obtain all outstanding PTSD treatment \r\nreports from Health Centers of Northern \r\nNew Mexico and Georgia Pines.\r\n\r\n2.  If any of the relevant records sought \r\nare not available, the veteran should be \r\nnotified of such fact and provided an \r\nexplanation of the efforts used to obtain \r\nthose records, and a description of any \r\nfurther action to be taken with respect \r\nto the claim.  VCAA, Pub. L. No. 106-475, \r\n� 3(a), 114 Stat. 2096, 2097-98 (2000) \r\n(codified at 38 U.S.C. � 5103A(b)(2)).\r\n\r\n3.  The veteran's complete service \r\nadministrative/personnel records (201 \r\nfile) should be obtained for appellate \r\nconsideration.  \r\n\r\n4.  The veteran should be requested to \r\nidentify all in-service stressor events \r\nand to provide information to help VA \r\nindependently confirm each alleged \r\nincident.  He should be told that the \r\nrequested information is vital to his \r\nclaim.  \r\n\r\n5.  If and only if one or more of the \r\nclaimed stressors is/are confirmed, the \r\nveteran should be afforded a VA \r\npsychiatric examination to determine \r\nwhether the veteran has PTSD which, in \r\nthe examiner's opinion is at least as \r\nlikely as not attributable to a confirmed \r\nstressor.  The examining psychiatrist \r\nshould review the claims file and conduct \r\nall indicated studies, report pertinent \r\npsychiatric complaints, symptoms and \r\nclinical findings.  The veteran is \r\nadvised that failure to report for a \r\nscheduled examination may have \r\nconsequences adverse to the claim.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.655 (2003).  \r\n\r\n6.  Thereafter, the veteran's claims file \r\nshould be reviewed to ensure that the \r\nabove requested development has been \r\ncompleted in its entirety.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the requested examination \r\nreport and required opinion, if needed, \r\nshould be reviewed to ensure that they \r\nare responsive to and in complete \r\ncompliance with the directives of this \r\nremand, also ensuring they are legible.  \r\nIf they are not, corrective procedures \r\nshould be implemented.  See Stegall v. \r\nWest, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).\r\n\r\n7.  After undertaking any development \r\ndeemed appropriate in addition to that \r\nspecified above, the issue of entitlement \r\nto service connection for PTSD should be \r\nformally readjudicated.\r\n\r\nIf the benefit requested on appeal is not granted to the \r\nveteran's satisfaction, the VBA AMC should issue a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case (SSOC).  The SSOC must \r\ncontain notice of all relevant actions taken on the claim for \r\nbenefits, to include a summary of the evidence and applicable \r\nlaw and regulations pertaining to the issue currently on \r\nappeal.  \r\n\r\nA reasonable period of time for a response should be \r\nafforded.  Thereafter, the case should be returned to the \r\nBoard for further appellate review, if otherwise in order.  \r\nBy this remand, the Board intimates no opinion as to any \r\nfinal outcome warranted.  No action is required of the \r\nappellant until he is notified by the VBA AMC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tWARREN W.

N. Bland, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from August 1970 to \r\nFebruary 1972, and from October 1976 to November 1978.\r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from a June 2001 rating decision of the Department \r\nof Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Columbia, \r\nSouth Carolina, which denied service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe veteran testified before the undersigned Veterans Law \r\nJudge at a video hearing in May 2004.  A transcript of that \r\nhearing is of record.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify you if \r\nfurther action is required on your part.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nUnder the regulations, service connection for PTSD requires \r\nmedical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with \r\n38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) (2003); a link, established by medical \r\nevidence, between current symptoms and an in-service \r\nstressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed \r\nin-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2003). \r\n\r\nThe veteran has produced medical evidence in the form of a \r\nletter from K. Northwall, M.D., which shows that he received \r\na diagnosis of PTSD.  The April 2002 letter documented the \r\nveteran's alleged stressors which involve sights he witnessed \r\nas an undercover narcotics military police officer.  A May \r\n2002 VA psychiatric examination confirmed the diagnosis of \r\nPTSD.  The VA examiner documented the alleged in-service \r\nstressors in May 2002.  The veteran also offered testimony as \r\nto these stressors at his May 2004 hearing.  \r\n\r\nWhere a veteran reports a stressor, and credible evidence of \r\nthe stressor is needed, VA will:\r\n\r\nRequest specific details of the in-\r\nservice stressful incident(s): date(s), \r\nplace(s), unit of assignment at the time \r\nof the event(s), description of the \r\nevent(s), medal(s) or citation(s) \r\nreceived as a result of the event(s), \r\nand, if appropriate, name(s) and other \r\nidentifying information concerning any \r\nother individuals involved in the \r\nevent(s).  As a minimum, the claim must \r\nindicate the location and approximate \r\ntime (a 2-month specific date range) of \r\nthe stressful event(s) in question, and \r\nthe unit of assignment at the time the \r\nstressful event occurred.  Inform the \r\nveteran that this information is \r\nnecessary to obtain supportive evidence \r\nof the stressful event(s) and that \r\nfailure to respond or an incomplete \r\nresponse may result in denial of the \r\nclaim.   \r\nM21-1, Part III, Para. 5.14(c) (Aug. 12, 2003). \r\n\r\nThis action does not appear to have been undertaken.  The \r\nlack of such action may be due to the fact that on the VA \r\nexamination in March 2002, the examiner did not diagnose \r\nPTSD.  However, VA has since confirmed a diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), \r\ncodified at 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, \r\n5107, 5126, and Pub. L. No. 108-183, �� 701(a),(b); 117 Stat. \r\n2651 (Dec. 16, 2003) (to be codified at 38 U.S.C.A. � 5102, \r\n5103(b)), specifically provides that the duty to assist \r\nincludes obtaining relevant records (including private \r\nrecords) that the claimant adequately identifies to the \r\nSecretary and authorizes the Secretary to obtain, and that \r\nwhenever the Secretary, after making such reasonable efforts, \r\nis unable to obtain all of the relevant records sought, the \r\nSecretary shall notify the claimant that the Secretary is \r\nunable to obtain records with respect to the claim.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 5103A(b)(1), (2).  \r\n\r\nAt his May 2004 hearing, the veteran testified that he was \r\nreceiving psychiatric treatment from Dr. Northwall.  Although \r\nDr. Northwall has submitted a letter to the VA and a single \r\ntreatment record from August 2001, the veteran's complete \r\npsychiatric treatment records are not part of the claims \r\nfolder.  \r\n\r\nAlso, a November 2000 letter from M. Meiler, M.D., indicates \r\nthat he veteran received treatment from him for the past two \r\nyears for increasing difficulty sleeping and Dr. Meiler \r\nopined that it was perhaps part of PTSD.  Dr. Meiler's \r\ntreatment records are not associated with the claims folder.  \r\n\r\nVA has a duty to obtain records of treatment reported by \r\nprivate physicians.  Massey v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 204 (1994).   \r\n\r\nAccordingly, this case is REMANDED for the following \r\ndevelopment:\r\n\r\n1.  The AMC or RO should ask the veteran \r\nto provide the specific information \r\nneeded to obtain credible supporting \r\nevidence from the U.S. Armed Services \r\nCenter for Unit Records Research (CURR) \r\nin accordance with M21-1, Part III, Para. \r\n5.14(c).  If the veteran provides \r\nsufficient information, the AMC or RO \r\nshould attempt to obtain credible \r\nsupporting information from CURR. \r\n\r\n2.  The AMC or RO should take the \r\nnecessary steps to obtain records of the \r\nveteran's treatment from Dr Northwall and \r\nDr. Meiler. \r\n\r\n3.  The AMC or RO should then re-\r\nadjudicate the veteran's claim, and if it \r\nremains denied, issue a supplemental \r\nstatement of the case.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the case should be returned to the Board, if in \r\norder. \r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee The Veterans Benefits Act of 2003, Pub.

Hager, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from June 1969 to June 1971, \r\nwith subsequent service in the National Guard and Army \r\nReserves.\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\nfrom a rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs \r\n(VA) Regional Office (RO) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which \r\ndenied the veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe veteran testified at a January 2005 hearing before the \r\nundersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) of the Board.  A prior \r\nhearing before an undersigned Veterans Law Judge was \r\nconducted, but a transcript could not be made.  In view of \r\nthe two hearings, a Board of three decision is indicated.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that, in an October 2001 letter, the \r\nveteran's representative requested that her claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD \"be amended to include all psychiatric \r\ndisabilities.\"  Although the veteran has been granted a non-\r\nservice connected pension based in part on a major depressive \r\ndisorder and associated disabilities, the claims for service \r\nconnection for such psychiatric disorders have not been \r\nadjudicated.  These claims are therefore referred to the RO \r\nfor appropriate consideration and/or development.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the competent, probative evidence of \r\nrecord reflects that the veteran does not have PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� \r\n3.102, 3.303, 3.304(f), 3.159, 4.125 (2004).\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nVCAA\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. \r\nNo. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000), as codified at 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 5100 et seq. (West 2002), became effective on \r\nNovember 9, 2000.  This law redefines the obligations of VA \r\nwith respect to the duty to assist and includes an enhanced \r\nduty to notify a claimant as to the information and evidence \r\nnecessary to substantiate a claim for VA benefits.  There \r\nhave also been final regulations promulgated to implement the \r\nnew law.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the VCAA took effect after the veteran \r\nfiled her February 2000 claim.  But the VCAA applies to \r\nclaims filed prior to its November 9, 2000 effective date if \r\nVA had not finally decided the claim before that date.  See \r\nVAOPGCPREC 7-2003 (Nov. 19, 2003) (citing 66 Fed. Reg. \r\n45,620, 45,629 (Aug. 29, 2001)) (VA will apply VCAA \r\nimplementing regulations to any claim filed before November \r\n9, 2000 but not decided by VA as of that date).  VA had not \r\nfinally \"decided\" the veteran's claim prior to November 9, \r\n2000 because the RO in August 2001 readjudicated the claim \r\npursuant to section 7(b) of the VCAA (providing for \r\nreadjudication of claims, such as this one, that became final \r\nbetween July 14, 1999 and November 9, 2000, the date of the \r\nenactment of the VCAA, and were denied on the basis that they \r\nwere not well-grounded), and subsequently issued an August \r\n2001 statement of the case (SOC) and June 2002 supplemental \r\nSOC (SSOC).  See VAOPGCPREC 7-2003 (VA had authority to, and \r\ndid, provide that VCAA requirements apply to claims at all \r\nstages of VA proceedings, up to and including those pending \r\nbefore the Board).\r\n\r\nIn Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 115, 119 (2004) \r\n(Pelegrini), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans \r\nClaims (Court) revisited the notice requirements imposed upon \r\nVA by the VCAA.  The Court addressed both the timing and \r\ncontent of these notice requirements.  Id. at 119-121.  In \r\nVAOPGCPREC 7-2004 (July 16, 2004), VA's Office of General \r\nCounsel (GC) undertook to explain the holding of Pelegrini.  \r\nThe Board is bound by the precedent opinions of VA's General \r\nCounsel as the chief legal officer of the Department.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. � 7104(c) (West 2002).\r\n\r\nInitially, GC noted that the Court had described the \r\nstatements in its opinion as to the timing and content of \r\nVCAA notification as \"holdings,\" but, according to GC, the \r\nissues to which these \"holdings\" related were not necessary \r\nto the disposition of the case.  VAOPGCPREC 7-2004, at 2.  \r\nConsequently, GC implied that these statements constituted \r\ndicta rather than binding holdings.  Id. (citing dissenting \r\nopinion in Pelegrini and other cases characterizing Court \r\nstatements as dicta).  \r\n\r\nIn the case at hand, however, even if the Pelegrini Court's \r\nstatements as to the timing and content of VCAA notice were \r\nbinding holdings, the RO complied with them.\r\n\r\nThe Pelegrini Court held that a VCAA notice must be provided \r\nto a claimant before the initial unfavorable agency of \r\noriginal jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on a claim for VA \r\nbenefits.  Pelegrini, 18 Vet. App. at 115, 120.  However, as \r\nexplained in VAOPGCPREC 7-2004, the Court did not hold that, \r\nif this notice was not provided because VA had decided a \r\nclaim before November 9, 2000, the case must be returned to \r\nthe AOJ for the adjudication to start anew as though no \r\nprevious adjudication had occurred.  Id. at 2.  Rather, the \r\nPelegrini Court \"'specifically recognizes that where, as \r\nhere, that notice was not mandated at the time of the initial \r\nAOJ decision, the AOJ did not err in not providing such \r\nnotice specifically complying with section \r\n5103(a)/�3.159(b)(1) because an initial AOJ adjudication had \r\nalready occurred.'\"  Id. at 2 (quoting Pelegrini, 18 Vet. \r\nApp. at 120).  Therefore, according to GC, the Pelegrini \r\nCourt did not hold that VA must vitiate all AOJ decisions \r\nrendered prior to November 9, 2000 denying service connection \r\nclaims that were still pending before VA on that date in \r\norder to provide VCAA notice and adjudicate the claims anew.  \r\nVAOPGCPREC 7-2004 at 2-3.\r\n\r\nGC's interpretation of Pelegrini is directly relevant to the \r\npresent case.  Here, the RO's March 2000 rating decision \r\ndenying service connection for PTSD took place prior to \r\nenactment of the VCAA, and, therefore, prior to any VCAA \r\nnotification.  But according to Pelegrini, as interpreted by \r\nGC, the fact that the RO did not provide VCAA notification in \r\nthese circumstances (nor could it have, as the VCAA had not \r\nyet been enacted) was not error.  Moreover, prior to \r\nreadjudicating the claim, the RO sent the veteran a June 2001 \r\nletter explaining its duty to assist her and, in its August \r\n2001 readjudication of her claim, the RO noted its duty to \r\nassist her under the VCAA.  The RO thus complied with the \r\nVCAA notification timing requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Court in Pelegrini also held that VCAA notice must:  \r\n(1) inform the claimant about the information and evidence \r\nnot of record that is necessary to substantiate the claim; \r\n(2) inform the claimant about the information and evidence \r\nthat VA will seek to provide; (3) inform the claimant about \r\nthe information and evidence the claimant is expected to \r\nprovide; and (4) request or tell the claimant to provide any \r\nevidence in his or her possession that pertains to the claim.  \r\nPelegrini, 18 Vet. App. at 120-121.  This new \"fourth \r\nelement\" of the notice requirement comes from the language \r\nof 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1) (2004).  Id. at 121.  According to \r\nGC, Pelegrini did not require that VCAA notification contain \r\nany specific \"magic words,\" and that it can be satisfied by \r\na SOC or SSOC as long as the document meets the four content \r\nrequirements listed above.  VAOPGCPREC 7-2004, at 3.\r\n\r\nThese requirements were met in this case.  The RO's June 2001 \r\nletter explained the application of the VCAA to the veteran's \r\nclaim for service connection for PTSD.  Specifically, the RO \r\nexplained the type of evidence needed to substantiate the \r\nveteran's claim and the respective responsibilities of the \r\nveteran and the RO in obtaining this evidence.  The RO also \r\nwrote: \"There may be other evidence you would like us to \r\nconsider.  In that case, please tell us about it and we will \r\nmake reasonable efforts to try to get it.\"  And, as \r\npreviously indicated, the RO noted its duty to assist under \r\nthe VCAA in its August 2001 readjudication of the veteran's \r\nclaim.  Cf. Valiao v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 229, 232 (2003) \r\n(noting Board's failure to discuss whether RO's decision and \r\nSOC satisfied VCAA requirements in the absence of letter \r\nexplaining VCAA).  Thus, VA complied with the VCAA notice \r\ncontent requirements.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the RO complied with the VCAA's preliminary duty \r\nto assist provisions and their implementing regulations.  The \r\nRO obtained the veteran's service medical records (SMRs) and \r\nall identified VA and private treatment records, as indicated \r\nat the Board hearing (Hearing transcript, p. 5).  The RO also \r\nobtained personnel records and documents relating to the \r\ncourt martial of the soldier the veteran claimed assaulted \r\nher.  In addition, prior to readjudication of her claim, the \r\nveteran was afforded a July 2001 PTSD examination.  Moreover, \r\nthere is no indication that other private or Federal records \r\nexist that should be requested, or that any pertinent \r\nevidence was not received.\r\n\r\nTherefore, under these circumstances, no further development \r\nis required to comply with the VCAA or the implementing \r\nregulations, and the Board will proceed to adjudicate the \r\nveteran's claim.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplicable Legal Principles, Factual Background, and Analysis\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom a disease contracted or an injury sustained while on \r\nactive duty in the military, or for aggravation \r\nduring service.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 2002); 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.303 (2004).  In addition to the requirements \r\ngenerally applicable to service connection claims, service \r\nconnection for PTSD requires medical evidence establishing a \r\ndiagnosis in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) (2004) (the \r\ndiagnosis must conform to DSM-IV and be supported by findings \r\non examination), credible supporting evidence that the \r\nclaimed in-service stressors actually occurred, and a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence, between the current \r\nsymptomatology and the claimed in-service stressors.  38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2004); see also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. \r\nApp. 128, 137-138 (1997).\r\n\r\nWith PTSD as with other disabilities, evidence of current \r\ndisability is one of the fundamental requirements for a grant \r\nof service connection.  See, e.g., Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 \r\nVet. App. 223, 225 (1992) (\"Congress specifically limits \r\nentitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases \r\nwhere such incidents have resulted in a disability.  In the \r\nabsence of proof of present disability there can be no valid \r\nclaim.\"); see also Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1333 \r\n(Fed. Cir. 1997) (upholding interpretation of 38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n1131 as requiring the existence of a present disability for \r\nVA compensation purposes); Wamhoff v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 517, \r\n521 (1996).\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the preponderance of the competent, \r\nprobative evidence of record indicates that the veteran does \r\nnot have PTSD.\r\n\r\nThere is no record of treatment for any psychiatric disorder \r\nduring service, and the May 1971 separation examination \r\nreflects that the veteran's psychiatric condition was normal.  \r\nA March 1984 quadrennial examination from the veteran's Army \r\nreserve service similarly indicates her psychiatric condition \r\nas normal.  A July 1986 treatment note during the veteran's \r\nArmy reserves service noted a lot of emotional stress \r\nrelating to her children, and domestic and employment \r\ndifficulties, but did not diagnose the veteran with any \r\npsychiatric disorder, including PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn October 1991, the veteran was admitted to a VA hospital \r\nwith chest pains and diagnosed with anxiety disorder, while \r\npossible depression was ruled out.  A December 1991 VA \r\noutpatient treatment (VAOPT) record ruled out dysthymic \r\ndisorder and panic disorder, and did not diagnose the veteran \r\nwith any psychiatric disorder.  November 1995 private \r\ntreatment records diagnose the veteran with \r\nanxiety/depression.  The veteran was again hospitalized in \r\nFebruary 1996, and diagnosed with adjustment disorder with \r\ndepressed mood, was said to have no personality disorder \r\n(Axis II), and had severe psychosocial stressors of \r\nunemployment and caring for a child.  February 1996 private \r\ntreatment records again diagnosed the veteran with depression \r\nwith an anxious component.  March 1996 private treatment \r\nrecords indicate the veteran complained of memory problems \r\nand disorientation from psychiatric medication.\r\n\r\nA July 1996 VA examination report indicated that the veteran \r\nappeared to have recurrent major depressive disorder, severe, \r\nmixed with generalized anxiety disorder, embedded in a very \r\nvirulent mixed personality disorder with borderline, \r\nparanoid, and marked passive dependence/passive aggressive \r\nfeatures.  The examiner also wrote: \"There is no evidence of \r\nposttraumatic stress disorder and this examiner can find no \r\nevidence to suggest that any of the patient's current \r\npsychiatric difficulties were incurred in the service or \r\naggravated by such or appeared within one year of \r\ndischarge.\"  \r\n\r\nThe veteran was again hospitalized from January to February \r\n2000, at which time she was again diagnosed with major \r\ndepression with psychotic features and a history of \r\ngeneralized anxiety disorder.  There was no diagnosis of \r\npersonality disorder (Axis II).\r\n\r\nA September 2000 VAOPT note entitled, \"Individual Therapy,\" \r\nstated that the veteran appeared somewhat bizarre in \r\nappearance and different in presentation.  She commented \r\nabout \"the devils and demons in the world\" and her affect \r\nchanged and she became tearful when asked about this \r\nstatement.  The physician wrote: \"It is not clear to me just \r\nwhat is going on for her in this regard although she assures \r\nme that she is not actively hallucinating and she did not \r\nappear to be doing that, but I see her as somewhat vulnerable \r\nand frail.\"  The diagnosis was, \"Schizoaffective disorder, \r\nprobable post-traumatic stress disorder.\"  November 2000 and \r\nFebruary 2001 VAOPT notes diagnosed the veteran with \r\ndepressive disorder and anxiety and various physical \r\ndisorders.  \r\n\r\nAt a July 2001 VA examination, the veteran's claims file and \r\navailable clinical records were reviewed, including the June \r\n1996 VA examination, which was described as \"highly \r\ndetailed.\"  After describing the mental status examination \r\nand objective findings, the examiner stated that the \r\nveteran's clinical picture remained highly consistent with a \r\ndiagnosis of major depression, recurrent with psychotic \r\nfeatures, and generalized anxiety disorder with somatization.  \r\nAlso noted were a complicated history of victimization, \r\ncompounded by mixed personality disturbance.  The examiner \r\nalso noted the veteran's claimed stressor of being molested \r\nby a female perpetrator in service, a stressor that the \r\nexaminer found to be highly consistent over time based on his \r\nreview of the record.  The examiner also found credible the \r\npattern of reactivation of this prior trauma, based on re-\r\nexposure to homosexual acts she witnessed on an impatient \r\nunit.  Significantly, the examiner concluded: \"However, \r\nwhile the veteran does describe some symptoms that are \r\ncharacteristic of traumatic victimization and of PTSD, such \r\nas intrusive recollections and avoidance, she does not meet \r\nthe full spectrum of symptoms necessary to meet diagnostic \r\ncriteria for PTSD.\"\r\n\r\nA July 2001 VAOPT note diagnosed the veteran with depression \r\nand various physical disorders.  An October 2001 VAOPT note \r\ndiagnosed the veteran with possible organic affective \r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nIn her May 1996 responses to a PTSD questionnaire and \r\nstatements of February 2000, April 2000, June 2001, and \r\nOctober 2003, the veteran indicated that a large female \r\nsoldier assaulted and threatened her.  A close friend of the \r\nveteran submitted an October 2003 lay statement that \r\nsupported the veteran's account of the incident and stated \r\nthat the veteran had reported the incident to her at the time \r\nit occurred.\r\n\r\nBased on the above, the veteran's claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD must be denied because the preponderance \r\nof the competent, probative evidence of record reflects that \r\nthe veteran does not have and has never had PTSD.  With a \r\nsingle exception, the in-service and extensive post-service \r\ntreatment records of the veteran do not contain any diagnosis \r\nof PTSD, and this includes evaluations that diagnosed her \r\nwith other psychiatric disorders and declined to diagnose her \r\nwith PTSD.  Moreover, the two thorough and detailed VA \r\nexaminations, in July 1996 and recently in July 2001, \r\ncarefully examined the veteran consistent with the criteria \r\nin DSM-IV and specifically found that the veteran did not \r\nmeet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.  Significantly, \r\nthe most recent July 2001 VA examiner reached this conclusion \r\nafter crediting the veteran's claimed stressor and her \r\nstatements regarding its effect on her.  In contrast, the \r\nsingle diagnosis of PTSD came at the end of a short VAOPT \r\nnote, which recounted only a brief therapy session with the \r\nveteran, did not discuss the DSM-IV criteria, admitted the \r\nveteran's mental status was \"not clear\" to the physician, \r\nand did not explain why the physician concluded that the \r\nveteran had schizoaffective disorder and \"probable\" PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn rendering its findings regarding service-connection \r\nclaims, the Board has the responsibility of weighing the \r\nevidence, including the medical evidence, for purposes of \r\ndetermining where to give credit and where to withhold the \r\nsame. Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 22, 30 (1998) (citing Owens \r\nv. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995)).  In so doing, the \r\nBoard may accept one medical opinion and reject others.  Id.  \r\nAt the same time, Board cannot make its own independent \r\nmedical determinations, and there must be plausible reasons, \r\nbased upon medical evidence in the record, for favoring one \r\nmedical opinion over another.  Evans, 12 Vet. App. at 30; \r\nRucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997) (citing Colvin v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 175 (1991)).  This is \r\nparticularly true in the case of PTSD, which applicable \r\nregulations require be diagnosed in accordance with DSM-IV \r\nand be supported by findings on examination.  Because the \r\nmost recent, July 2001 VA examination contained a detailed \r\nand accurate discussion of the veteran's psychiatric history, \r\nexplained why the examiner, although crediting the veteran's \r\nstatements regarding her claimed stressor, concluded that she \r\ndid meet the criteria for PTSD as required by the applicable \r\nregulatory criteria, and is supported by the other evidence \r\nof record, whereas the single diagnosis of \"probable\" PTSD \r\ndid not contain any such examination findings or explanation \r\nof its conclusion, the Board gives greater weight to the \r\nformer and correspondingly discounts the latter.  As to lay \r\nstatements of the veteran and her friend, while they are \r\ncompetent to testify as to what the veteran experienced and \r\nher contemporaneous description of this experience, see \r\nFalzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 403 (1995), they are not \r\ncompetent to testify regarding whether the veteran has PTSD, \r\neither as a result the claimed in-service stressor or \r\notherwise, as the latter requires medical expertise.  Cromley \r\nv. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 376, 379 (1995).\r\n\r\nConsequently, as the preponderance of the competent, \r\nprobative evidence of record indicates that the veteran does \r\nnot have PTSD, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for \r\napplication, and her claim for service connection for this \r\ndisorder must be denied.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b) \r\n(West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102 (2004); Alemany v. Brown, 9 \r\nVet. App. 518, 519-20 (1996); Brammer v.

J. Vecchiollo\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from October 1969 to \r\nSeptember 1973.  \r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from a September 2003 rating decision of the \r\nOakland, California, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \r\nRegional Office (RO). \r\n\r\nTo support his claim, the veteran testified at a hearing at \r\nthe RO in December 2004 before the undersigned Veterans Law \r\nJudge (VLJ) of the Board.\r\n\r\nBecause further development of the evidence is required, this \r\ncase is being REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC) in Washington, DC.  VA will notify you if \r\nfurther action is required on your part.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for disability \r\nresulting from a personal injury sustained or a disease \r\ncontracted in the line of duty, or for aggravation \r\nduring service of a pre-existing condition beyond its natural \r\nprogression.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD, in particular, requires medical \r\nevidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, \r\nbetween current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and \r\ncredible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service \r\nstressor occurred.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2004); Anglin \r\nv. West, 11 Vet. App. 361, 367 (1998); Gaines v. West, 11 \r\nVet. App. 353, 357 (1998), Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, \r\n138 (1997); Suozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307 (1997).  The \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD must comply with the criteria set forth in \r\nthe American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and \r\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM- \r\nIV).  See, generally, Cohen v. Brown, supra; 38 C.F.R. � \r\n4.125.\r\n\r\nThe evidence necessary to establish that the claimed stressor \r\nactually occurred varies depending on whether the veteran \r\n\"engaged in combat with the enemy,\" as established by \r\nrecognized military combat citations or other official \r\nrecords.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d); see \r\nCollette v. Brown, 82 F.3d 389 (Fed.Cir. 1996); Gregory v. \r\nBrown, 8 Vet. App. 563 (1996); Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. \r\n91 (1993).  If VA determines the veteran engaged in combat \r\nwith the enemy and his alleged stressor is combat-related, \r\nthen his lay testimony or statement is accepted as conclusive \r\nevidence of the stressor's occurrence and no further \r\ndevelopment or corroborative evidence is required-provided \r\nthat such testimony is found to be \"satisfactory,\" i.e., \r\ncredible, and \"consistent with the circumstances, conditions, \r\nor hardships of service.\"  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b); \r\n38 C.F.R. 3.304(d); Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 \r\n(1993).  If, however, VA determines either that the veteran \r\ndid not engage in combat with the enemy or that he did engage \r\nin combat, but that the alleged stressor is not combat \r\nrelated, then his lay testimony, in and of itself, is not \r\nsufficient to establish the occurrence of the alleged \r\nstressor.  Instead, the record must contain other objective \r\ninformation that corroborates his testimony or statements.  \r\nSee Zarycki, 6 Vet. App. at 98.\r\n\r\nAlthough the veteran has received a diagnosis of PTSD \r\nstemming from his alleged experiences in service, these \r\nexperiences have not been verified.  The RO already has \r\nrequested that he furnish a list of his claimed stressors in \r\nservice, however, his response did not provide sufficient \r\ndetail (insofar as names, places and dates) to enable the RO \r\nto verify the alleged incidents.  See, e.g., Wood v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 192-93 (1991) (The duty to assist \r\nis not always a one-way street).  The Court also held in Wood \r\nthat asking him to provide this level of detail and \r\ninformation does not place an impossible or onerous burden on \r\nhim.  Id., at 193.\r\n\r\nDuring his December 2004 hearing, however, the veteran \r\nprovided more details regarding his claimed experiences in \r\nservice.  He claimed that he has PTSD as a result of numerous \r\nstressors while serving as a radio operator aboard a P-3 \r\nOrion aircraft, witnessing another P-3 Orion crash, and \r\nundergoing survival, evasion, resistance and escape (SERE) \r\ntraining.  His service personnel records do not corroborate \r\nany of these incidents.  So he must be given another \r\nopportunity to provide more specific information, as more \r\ndetails are still needed.\r\n\r\nIn remanding this case to give the veteran this additional \r\nopportunity, the Board feels compelled to reiterate that he \r\nmust accept some personal responsibility in the verification \r\nof his alleged stressors by providing the requested names, \r\ndates and places in question.  And as already indicated, \r\nasking this level of detail and information does not place an \r\nimpossible or onerous task on him.  See Wood, 1 Vet. App. at \r\n193.  And if he provides sufficient information to conduct a \r\nmeaningful search, the RO must attempt to verify his alleged \r\nstressors, for example, by contacting the U.S. Armed Services \r\nCenter for Unit Records Research (USASCURR).  See VA \r\nAdjudication Procedure Manual, M21-1, Part III, 4.23 (Change \r\n41, July 12, 1995) - previously, M21-1, 6.04(e) (Change 150, \r\nJan. 24, 1977).\r\n\r\nThe duty to assist also includes, when necessary to decide a \r\ncase, an obligation to conduct a thorough and contemporaneous \r\nexamination to obtain a medical opinion.  38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n5103A(d) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(4) (2004); see \r\nalso Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 121 (1991).  So if a \r\nverified stressor is obtained, the veteran should be \r\nscheduled for another VA examination to determine whether he \r\nhas PTSD as a result of a confirmed stressor.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this case is REMANDED to the RO for the \r\nfollowing development and consideration:\r\n\r\n1.  Contact the veteran to obtain the \r\ninformation necessary to acquire his \r\ncomplete clinical records pertaining to \r\nany treatment for a psychiatric disorder, \r\nbut particularly PTSD, which are not \r\ncurrently on file.  This includes, but is \r\nnot limited to, his ongoing treatment \r\nfrom clinicians Mills, Nolan, and \r\nSolomon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Also ask the veteran to provide a \r\nmore detailed statement discussing his \r\nalleged stressful incidents in service \r\n(including specific names, places, and \r\ndates and the base(s) and unit(s) to \r\nwhich he was assigned at the time of the \r\nincidents in question).  He should be \r\ninformed of his personal responsibility \r\nand critical need to provide this \r\ninformation to support his claim.  This \r\nincludes any helpful information such as \r\na statements from fellow servicemen who \r\nwitnessed the incidents.\r\n\r\n3.  If it is determined the veteran did \r\nnot engage in combat with the enemy in \r\nVietnam, or that his alleged stressor is \r\nnot combat related, then attempt to \r\nverify his purported stressors in service \r\nby all appropriate means.  This includes, \r\nif necessary, contacting the USASCURR or \r\nother appropriate authority.\r\n\r\n4.  Prepare a list of the stressors that \r\nwere confirmed or, if applicable, those \r\npresumed to be credible if the veteran \r\nengaged in combat and his stressors are \r\ncombat related.\r\n\r\n5.  If there is proof of at least one \r\nstressor, schedule the veteran for a VA \r\npsychiatric examination to obtain a \r\nmedical opinion indicating whether it is \r\nat least as likely as not that he has \r\nPTSD due to that stressor(s).  Notify the \r\nexaminer that only those stressors that \r\nwere confirmed, or otherwise presumed \r\nconfirmed, are to be considered.  If PTSD \r\nis diagnosed, the examiner must specify \r\nwhat specific stressor was the basis of \r\nthe diagnosis.  Also ask that he/she \r\ndiscuss the rationale for their medical \r\nopinion based on a review of the other \r\nrelevant evidence in the claims file.\r\n\r\n6.  Then readjudicate the veteran's claim \r\nfor service connection for PTSD based on \r\nthe additional evidence obtained.  If his \r\nclaim continues to be denied, send him \r\nand his representative an appropriate \r\nsupplemental statement of the case (SSOC) \r\nand give them an opportunity to respond.\r\n\r\nThe veteran need take no action until he is further informed.  \r\nNo inference should be drawn regarding the final disposition \r\nof the claim as a result of this action.\r\n\r\nThe veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument concerning the claim the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee The Veterans Benefits Act of 2003, Pub.

Gearin, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from February 1966 to \r\nDecember 1968.  \r\n\r\nThis matter came to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on \r\nappeal of a rating decision of the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Louisville, Kentucky.  \r\n\r\nIn May 2004, the veteran's accredited representative notified \r\nthe RO that it had revoked its representation of the veteran.  \r\nThe veteran has proceeded to represent himself in his appeal.\r\n\r\nIn March 2005, the veteran testified at a hearing before the \r\nundersigned Acting Veterans Law Judge, presiding at the RO. A \r\ntranscript of this hearing is associated with the claims \r\nfolder. \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the veteran \r\nif further action is required on his part.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that he has PTSD due to stressors \r\nencountered while he was serving in the Republic of Vietnam.  \r\nHis service personnel records show that he was stationed at \r\n\"Chu-Lai area\" while in the Republic of Vietnam, although, \r\nhe acknowledges that he was not awarded any combat medals, \r\nincluding the Purple Heart.  The veteran's claimed stressors \r\ninclude being hit by grenade shrapnel, being fired on by \r\nenemy mortar attacks, and witnessing events that he felt \r\nthreatened his life.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of record includes medical records documenting \r\ntreatment of the veteran for PTSD in the mid to late 1980s, \r\nbut the records do not identify the stressor(s) upon which \r\nthe diagnosis is based.  To date, the veteran has not been \r\nafforded a VA examination to determine if he has PTSD and, if \r\nso, the stressors supporting the diagnosis.  In the Board's \r\nopinion, such an examination is required to comply with VA's \r\nduty to assist the veteran in the development of the facts \r\npertinent to his claim.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(4) (2004). \r\n\r\nThe veteran testified that he received VA medical treatment \r\nimmediately after service from 1969 to 1972.  He then \r\nreceived VA treatment when he lived in Kentucky from 1972 to \r\n1976.  After that, he received VA treatment when he lived in \r\nOklahoma.  The RO has only requested medical records from VA \r\nfacilities in Ohio, Kentucky, and Oklahoma since 1990 based \r\nupon the veteran's prior statements.  Records generated by VA \r\nare constructively included within the record.  If records of \r\nVA treatment are material to the issue on appeal and are not \r\nincluded within the claims folder, a remand is necessary to \r\nacquire such VA records.  Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611, \r\n613 (1992); see also 38 C.F.R. � 3.159 (2004).  Therefore, an \r\nattempt should be made to contact the VA medical facilities \r\nin Ohio, Kentucky, and Oklahoma to determine whether any \r\ntreatment records exist from 1969 to 1990.  Accordingly, this \r\ncase is REMANDED to the RO via the AMC, in Washington, D.C., \r\nfor the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO or AMC should undertake appropriate \r\ndevelopment to obtain any pertinent evidence \r\nidentified but not provided by the veteran.  The \r\nrecords obtained should include any pertinent VA \r\noutpatient records from the VA medical facility \r\nin Ohio from 1969 to 1972; in Kentucky from 1972 \r\nto 1976, and in Oklahoma thereafter.  \r\n\r\n2.  If the RO or AMC is unsuccessful in its \r\nefforts to obtain any pertinent evidence \r\nidentified by the veteran, it should so inform \r\nthe veteran and his representative, if any, and \r\nrequest them to submit the outstanding evidence.\r\n\r\n3.  When all indicated record development has \r\nbeen completed, the veteran should be afforded a \r\nVA psychiatric examination to determine if he has \r\nPTSD due to service stressor(s).  The claims \r\nfolder must be made available to and reviewed by \r\nthe examiner, and any indicated studies should be \r\nperformed.\r\n\r\n?\tA diagnosis of PTSD should be confirmed or \r\nruled out.  If PTSD is not diagnosed, the \r\nexaminer should explain why the veteran \r\ndoes not meet the criteria for this \r\ndiagnosis.  If PTSD is diagnosed, the \r\nelements supporting the diagnosis, to \r\ninclude the stressor(s), should be \r\nidentified.\r\n\r\n4.  The RO or AMC should also undertake any other \r\ndevelopment it determines to be warranted.\r\n\r\n5.  Then, the RO or AMC should readjudicate the \r\nveteran's claim.  If the benefit sought on appeal \r\nis not granted to the veteran's satisfaction, a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case should be \r\nissued to the veteran and his representative, and \r\nthey should be afforded the requisite opportunity \r\nto respond before the case is returned to the \r\nBoard for further appellate action.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).  This claim \r\nmust be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires \r\nthat all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' \r\nAppeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans \r\nClaims for additional development or other appropriate action \r\nmust be handled in an expeditious manner.

Liu, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran, who is the appellant in this case, served on \r\nactive duty from March 1967 to March 1969.\r\n\r\nThis matter arises before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) from a November 1994 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nNewark, New Jersey, which denied the veteran's claim seeking \r\nentitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress \r\ndisorder (PTSD).\r\n\r\nThe veteran, appeared before the Board for a hearing held on \r\nappeal in August 1997; a transcript is associated with the \r\nclaims folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.\tThe veteran is a non-combat veteran who served in the \r\nRepublic of Vietnam during the Vietnam war where he performed \r\ntransportation duties as a petroleum storage specialist; From \r\napproximately September 1967 to June 1968, he served with the \r\n262nd Quartermaster Battalion, 525th Quartermaster Company.\r\n\r\n2.\tThere is no credible supporting evidence to verify or \r\ncorroborate the veteran's claimed in-service stressors of \r\nbeing exposed to enemy mortar and rocket attacks, and being a \r\nwitness to a rocket attack that killed a friend of his, while \r\noperating in \"Dong Ha\" and \"Gong Hoi,\" Vietnam, during \r\napproximately December 1967 to March 1968.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by active military \r\nservice. 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n�� 1101, 1110, 1111, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304 (2003).\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nCompliance with the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 \r\n(VCAA)\r\n\r\nOn November 9, 2000, the VCAA was enacted. See 38 U.S.C.A. �� \r\n5103, 5103A (West 2002). Among other things, the VCAA amended \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103 to clarify VA's duty to notify claimants \r\nand their representatives of any information that is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim for benefits. The VCAA \r\nalso created \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A, which codifies VA's duty to assist, and \r\nessentially states that VA will make reasonable efforts to \r\nassist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to \r\nsubstantiate a claim. The claimant must be given proper \r\nnotice and an opportunity to respond. Implementing \r\nregulations for the VCAA were subsequently enacted, which \r\nwere also made effective November 9, 2000, for the most part. \r\n66 Fed. Reg. 45,620 (Aug. 29, 2001) (codified at 38 C.F.R. �� \r\n3.102, 3.159). The intended effect of the implementing \r\nregulations was to establish clear guidelines consistent with \r\nthe intent of Congress regarding the timing and scope of \r\nassistance VA will provide to claimants who file a claim for \r\nbenefits. 66 Fed. Reg. 45,620 (Aug. 29, 2001). Both the VCAA \r\nand the implementing regulations are applicable in the \r\npresent case, and will be collectively referred to as \"the \r\nVCAA.\" \r\n\r\nTo comply with the aforementioned VCAA requirements under 38 \r\nU.S.C. � 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b), the RO must \r\nsatisfy the following four duty to notify and assist \r\nrequirements.\r\n \r\nFirst, the veteran must be informed of the information and \r\nevidence that is necessary to substantiate his claim. See 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 5103 and 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.159(b)(1) (2004). In February 2001 and December 2003, the \r\nRO informed the veteran of its duty to assist the veteran in \r\ndeveloping his case. In the statement and letter to the \r\nveteran, VA informed the veteran of the evidence necessary to \r\nprove his claim for entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD. Specifically, VA informed the veteran that to establish \r\nentitlement, he will need to obtain medical records, \r\ntreatment records, and service records. VA informed the \r\nveteran that to establish entitlement, he will need to obtain \r\nevidence to show in-service occurrence or aggravation of a \r\ndisease or injury, and he must show a relationship between \r\nthe disease or injury, and his current disability. \r\n\r\nVA also informed him that he will need to provide evidence \r\nshowing specific in-service stressors that gave rise to the \r\ndisability. The RO sent the veteran several letters in June \r\n1967, January 1999, and in March 2004 informing him that he \r\nneeded to try to provide detailed information about the \r\nstressors including the exact dates and places, as well as \r\nthe units involved, and if there were any casualties or \r\nwounded in action, he should give the RO their names, ranks, \r\nand units.\r\n\r\nSecond, the veteran must be informed of the information and \r\nevidence VA will seek to provide.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103 and \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1) (2004). In its February 2001 \r\nstatement and December 2003 letter, VA informed the veteran \r\nthat it would continue to assist him in obtaining his medical \r\nrecords, employment records, records from other federal \r\nagencies, and any other records it receives notice of.\r\n\r\nThird, the veteran must be informed of the information and \r\nevidence the claimant is expected to provide. See 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5103 and 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1) (2004). In the February \r\n2001 statement and December 2003 letter, VA instructed the \r\nveteran to provide information about any additional \r\ninformation or evidence that he wanted VA to help him obtain. \r\n\r\nFinally, the veteran must be requested to provide any \r\nevidence in his possession that pertains to the claim. See 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 5103 and 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1) (2004). \r\nThroughout the adjudication process, and in the February 2001 \r\nstatement and December 2003 letter, VA has asked the veteran \r\nto provide information about evidence that might be \r\navailable, and was told VA would assist him in obtaining any \r\nadditional evidence. When the appellant has provided \r\ninformation about available evidence or where he was treated \r\nor examined for his claimed condition, VA has obtained the \r\nrecords. \r\n\r\nIn October 2002, the Board directed the case for additional \r\ndevelopment to obtain from the veteran details of his claimed \r\nin-service stressors and to request additional corroborating \r\ninformation from the U.S. Armed Services Center for Research \r\nof Unit Records (USASCRUR). The veteran responded to the \r\nrequest by providing a description of his in-service \r\nstressors and the USASCRUR submitted the findings of its \r\nresearch. In March 2005, the veteran's representative \r\nsubmitted a letter indicating that it had no further new \r\nevidence or arguments to add.\r\n\r\nIn view of the development that has been undertaken in this \r\nclaim, further development is not needed to comply with VCAA. \r\nThe appellant has been informed of the information and \r\nevidence needed to substantiate his claim, and he has been \r\nmade aware of how VA would assist him in obtaining evidence \r\nand information. He has not identified any additional, \r\nrelevant evidence that has not been requested or obtained. \r\nFor the aforementioned reasons, there is no reasonable \r\npossibility that further assistance would aid in the \r\nsubstantiation of the claim. In short, the requirements under \r\nthe VCAA have been met. Accordingly, there is no potential \r\nprejudice to the veteran for failure to develop the claim. \r\nTherefore, the Board will proceed to consider the merits of \r\nthe appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFactual Background \r\n\r\nService records indicate the veteran is a non-combat veteran \r\nwho served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam War \r\nperiod. His DD-214 lists his military occupational specialty \r\nas a petroleum storage specialist, and the veteran has \r\nindicated that he served primarily as a transport truck \r\ndriver. His list of decorations and medals received include a \r\nM-14 sharp shooting recognition, but they do not indicate any \r\ncommendations or citations for combat experience.\r\n\r\nThe veteran was assigned to the 525th Quartermaster Company \r\n(QM Co) in approximately September 1967, where he was until \r\napproximately June 1968. A Historical Brief of 262nd \r\nQuartermaster Battalion (QM Bn) activities indicated that the \r\n525th QM Co. was located in Cam Ranh Bay, as of January 1968. \r\nElements of the 262nd QM Bn were deployed in support of \r\ncombat operations during the first quarter of 1968, but the \r\nHistorical Brief indicated that certain elements of the 525th \r\nQM Co. were dispatched to Bon Dan.\r\n\r\nOn to the report of the veteran's February 1969 examination \r\nfor separation from service, the veteran gave a positive \r\nresponse to the question of whether he had or had ever had \r\n\"depression or excessive worry.\"  The examiner reported \r\nthat the veteran's psychiatric status was normal.\r\n\r\nA VA PTSD examination was conducted in October 1994, which \r\nindicated a diagnosis of a history of chronic alcohol and \r\ncocaine abuse, and mixed personality disorder. The veteran \r\nreported that he occasionally dreamed about his experiences \r\nin Vietnam and remembered seeing a number of his friends \r\nkilled, but the examiner remarked that the veteran did not \r\nappear to be preoccupied by thoughts of his service in \r\nVietnam. The examiner concluded that the veteran did not meet \r\nthe clinical criteria for PTSD.\r\n\r\nAnother VA PTSD examination was conducted in April 1997, but \r\nthe case folder was not reviewed. The veteran reported his \r\nservice history of serving in Cam Ranh Bay operating as a \r\ndriver of a five ton tractor-trailer throughout Vietnam. He \r\nindicated that his mission was to transport supplies into the \r\nfield, including food, fuel, and ammunition. He claimed that \r\ndespite having air cover, he was always frightened, felt \r\nvulnerable on these missions to enemy attacks and indicated \r\nthat he was exposed to death and injury on many occasions \r\nthroughout his Vietnam tour. He also described an incident in \r\nGong Hoi when his friend \"Walt\" was hit by an enemy \r\naircraft rocket attack.  He described the whole Vietnam \r\nexperience as terrifying and described many other similar \r\noccurrences of men being severely injured or killed. Based on \r\nthe veteran's reported history, the examiner diagnosed the \r\nveteran with PTSD and found the veteran to be socially \r\nisolated, suffering from flashbacks, and suffering from \r\nsurvivor guilt, with interrupted sleep. Under the assessment \r\nfor stressors, the examiner noted \"extreme: prolonged combat \r\nexposure.\"\r\n\r\nThe veteran appeared and testified before a Travel Board \r\nhearing in August 1997. At the hearing the veteran repeated \r\nhis claimed history of operating in Vietnam as a tractor \r\ntrailer driver and being subjected to enemy fire and \r\nwitnessing attacks against fellow soldiers. He testified that \r\nhe arrived in Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam sometime around August \r\n1967 and was assigned to perform transportation duties for \r\nthe 525th QM Co. as a tractor trailer driver. He indicated \r\nthat he stayed at Cam Ranh Bay for a month or so before he \r\nwas transported up to Da Nang and then up to Quang Tri, where \r\nhe continued to operate as a truck driver. He indicated that \r\nsometime between December 1967 and February 1968 he was \r\ntransported to Dong Ha and Phu Bai where he served a few \r\nmiles away from the Demilitarized Zone. The veteran testified \r\nthat while he drove his truck, he was often subjected to \r\nenemy rocket and mortar attacks, sometimes on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nThe veteran also testified about a specific incident in which \r\nhe claimed he witnessed the aftermath of an enemy aircraft \r\nrocket attack that landed on his friend's bunker, which \r\nkilled his friend. The veteran claimed he had retreated into \r\na bunker of his own and heard the explosive concussions. When \r\nhe came back out, he saw that his friend's bunker had been \r\nhit and that his friend was the only apparent fatality. At \r\nthe hearing, the veteran referred to his friend's name  as \r\n\"John.\"\r\n\r\nThe veteran submitted a further statement in June 2003 to \r\nprovide additional information about his claimed in-service \r\nstressors. He described being stationed in Cam Ranh Bay for \r\nthree months before being sent up north to Quang Tri to haul \r\ncargo such as fuel and food rations. Afterwards, he claimed \r\nthat sometime in January 1998 he was shipped even further up \r\nnorth to Dong Ha where the mortar/rocket incident occurred. \r\nHe indicated that he was rocketed 1 to 2 times a week and \r\nthat he witnessed many incidences of other soldiers being \r\nshot up or killed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw and Analysis\r\n\r\nThe veteran claims service connection for PTSD. In order to \r\nestablish service connection for the disability, the evidence \r\nmust show it resulted from disease or injury incurred in or \r\naggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 2002); \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (2004). Even if the condition at issue is \r\ninitially diagnosed after the veteran's discharge from \r\nservice, service connection may still be granted for any \r\ndisability first noted after discharge, when all of the \r\nevidence establishes that the disease was incurred in \r\nservice. 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d) (2004).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\nestablishing a diagnosis of the condition in accordance with \r\n38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) (2004); a link, established by medical \r\nevidence, between current symptomatology and an in-service \r\nstressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed \r\nin-service stressor actually occurred. If the evidence \r\nestablishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy \r\nand the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the \r\nabsence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and \r\nprovided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the \r\ncircumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's \r\nservice, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the \r\noccurrence of the claimed in-service stressor. If the \r\nevidence establishes that the veteran was a prisoner of war \r\nunder the provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 3.1(y) (2004), and the \r\nclaimed stressor is related to that prisoner-of-war \r\nexperience, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence \r\nto the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is \r\nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone \r\nmay establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service \r\nstressor. 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2004).\r\n\r\nThe record indicates the veteran served in the 525th QM Co. \r\nfrom approximately September 1967 to approximately June 1968.\r\n\r\nIn numerous statements submitted by the veteran to the RO and \r\naccording to his testimony made during his August 1997 \r\nhearing, the veteran claims that he arrived in Cam Ranh Bay \r\nsometime in August 1967 where he performed transportation \r\nduties as a tractor trailer driver. He indicates that after a \r\nfew months he was transported up to Da Nang and then up to \r\nQuang Tri, and that sometime during December 1967 and March \r\n1968 he was transported to Dong Ha\r\n and Phu Bai where he served a few miles away from the \r\nDemilitarized Zone. He indicates that as a truck driver, he \r\nwas often subjected to attacks from enemy fire, sometimes on \r\na daily basis. The veteran also reports a specific stressor \r\nincident, in which he claims he witnessed the aftermath of an \r\nenemy aircraft rocket attack that killed his friend. At his \r\nVA examination in April 1997, the veteran claimed his \r\nfriend's name was \"Walt.\" At his August 1997 hearing, he \r\nreferred to his friend's name as \"John,\" a name he has \r\nsince referred to and maintained.\r\n\r\nAccording to a document submitted by the U.S. Armed Services \r\nCenter for Research of Unit Records (USASCRUR), Operational \r\nReports-Lessons Learned submitted by the 262nd QM Bn, the \r\nhigher headquarters of the 525th QM Co. for the time period \r\nNovember 1, 1967 to April 30, 1968, state that the 525th QM \r\nCo. had elements of its unit at Cam Ranh Bay, Phan Rang, Vung \r\nRo, Tuy Hoa, and Qui Nhon during the period. They do not \r\nmention Dong Ha or Gong Hoi. In addition, they list attacks \r\nagainst units and locations of the 262nd QM Bn, however, the \r\nattacks against the 262nd QM Bn had no relation to Dong Ha or \r\nGong Hoi, although research showed that attacks did occur at \r\nDong Ha combat base in December 1967, in January 1968, and \r\nothers as well. Information concerning attacks against a \r\nlocation called Gong Hoi was not located.\r\n\r\nThe USASCRUR report also indicated that Morning Reports for \r\nthe 525th QM Co. for either 1967 or 1968 were not maintained. \r\nA search for remarks containing an incident where a rocket \r\nhit a bunker killing a person named \"John\" found no \r\nreference to an explosion or those killed in action.\r\n\r\nThe evidence shows that the veteran was diagnosed by a VA \r\nphysician for PTSD. However the evidence also shows that the \r\ndiagnosis was made without a review of the case folder or a \r\nreview of the recent evidence regarding the veteran's company \r\nassignment and company activities, and thus the diagnosis was \r\nbased primarily on the veteran's own reported history of \r\ncombat exposure. \r\n\r\nAs is true with any piece of evidence, the credibility and \r\nweight to be attached to medical opinions are within the \r\nprovince of the Board as adjudicators. Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 \r\nVet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993); see also Winsett v. West, 11 \r\nVet. App. 420 (1998) (Court affirmed the Board's decision \r\nwhich weighed two medical opinions, from an expert and a \r\ntreating physician); Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 \r\n(1995) (Board favoring one medical opinion over another is \r\nnot error).\r\n\r\nBecause the service records and evidence do not establish \r\nthat the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, the \r\nveteran may not rely on his lay testimony alone to establish \r\nthe occurrence of the claimed in-service stressors. See 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2004). There must be credible supporting \r\nevidence that the claimed in-service stressors actually \r\noccurred. This has not been provided or demonstrated as the \r\nevidence shows the veteran's claimed in-service stressors are \r\ninconsistent with the activities attributed to the company \r\nthe veteran was assigned to. The veteran was given the \r\nopportunity, but has not provided sufficient credible \r\nevidence to support his claim.\r\n\r\nIn summary, to establish service connection for PTSD there \r\nmust be a competent diagnosis of PTSD and credible evidence \r\nconfirming the occurrence of the claimed in-service \r\nstressors. A critical element needed to establish service \r\nconnection for PTSD is therefore missing. Consequently, the \r\nclaim of service connection for PTSD must be denied.\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for \r\nservice connection for PTSD. Thus, the benefit-of-the-doubt \r\ndoctrine is inapplicable, and the claim must be denied. 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet.

The Board refers this matter to the RO \r\nfor appropriate action.  In September 2000 and June 2003, the \r\nBoard remanded this issue for further development.  \r\n\r\nA motion to advance this case on the Board's docket was \r\ngranted under the authority of 38 U.S.C.A. � 7102(a) (West \r\n2002) and 38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c) (2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe veteran has a psychiatric disorder that is related to her \r\nservice-connected diabetes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe veteran has a psychiatric disorder which is proximately \r\ndue to or the result of a service-connected disability.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1131, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.303, 3.310 (2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe issue before the Board involves a claim of entitlement to \r\nservice connection.  Applicable law provides that service \r\nconnection will be granted if it is shown that the veteran \r\nsuffers from disability resulting from an injury suffered or \r\ndisease contracted in line of duty, or for aggravation of a \r\npreexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of \r\nduty, in the active military, naval, or air service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  That an injury \r\noccurred in service alone is not enough; there must be \r\nchronic disability resulting from that injury.  If there is \r\nno showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, \r\nthen a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service \r\nis required to support a finding of chronicity.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.303(b).  Additionally, for veterans who have served 90 \r\ndays or more of active service during a war period or after \r\nDecember 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities, such as \r\npsychoses, are presumed to have been incurred in service if \r\nmanifest to a compensable degree within one year of discharge \r\nfrom service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1101; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.307, 3.309.  \r\nService connection may also be granted for any disease \r\ndiagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including \r\nthat pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, disability which is proximately due to or the \r\nresult of a service-connected disease or injury shall be \r\nservice connected.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310.  The Board also notes \r\nthat secondary service connection on the basis of aggravation \r\nis permitted under 38 C.F.R. � 3.310, and compensation is \r\npayable for that degree of aggravation of a non-service-\r\nconnected disability caused by a service-connected \r\ndisability.  Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � \r\n4.125(a), a link, established by medical evidence, between \r\ncurrent symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor \r\noccurred.  If the evidence establishes that the veteran \r\nengaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is \r\nrelated to that combat, in the absence of clear and \r\nconvincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the \r\nclaimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, \r\nconditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the \r\nveteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of \r\nthe claimed in-service stressor.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\nThe provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) require that a \r\ndiagnosis of a mental disorder conform to the Diagnostic and \r\nStatistical Manual, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).\r\n\r\nPrior to March 1997, 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) provided that \r\nservice connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\nestablishing a clear diagnosis of the condition, credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in service stressor \r\nactually occurred, and a link, established by medical \r\nevidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed \r\ninservice stressor. If the claimed stressor is related to \r\ncombat, service department evidence that the veteran engaged \r\nin combat or that the veteran was awarded the Purple Heart, \r\nCombat Infantryman Badge, or similar combat citation will be \r\naccepted, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as \r\nconclusive evidence of the claimed in-service stressor.  38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1996).  The Board also notes that \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) was amended again with regards to the \r\npersonal assault PTSD claims.  However, the amendment did not \r\nchange the pertinent part of the regulation as in effect from \r\nMarch 1997 dealing with the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis.  \r\nSee 67 Fed. Reg. 10330 (Mar. 7, 2002).\r\n\r\nThe veteran claimed that she has PTSD due to the sexual \r\nharassment she was subjected to in service.  The veteran's \r\nmedical evidence does not indicate that she has a diagnosis \r\nof PTSD.  The veteran's July 1997 VA PTSD examination found \r\nthat the veteran did not meet the criteria for a PTSD \r\ndiagnosis.  The examiner indicated that there was no clear \r\ntraumatic event.  Thus without a PTSD diagnosis, the veteran \r\ndoes not meet the criteria for service connection for PTSD \r\nunder 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  Nevertheless, the Board finds \r\nthat the veteran's psychiatric disorder appears to be \r\nsecondary due to her service-connected diabetes.  \r\n\r\nVA progress notes dated in December 1997 showed the veteran \r\nwas depressed due to termination of her job, but was stable.  \r\nA December 1997 note from a VA medical professional stated \r\nthat the veteran was an insulin dependent diabetic and had \r\nbeen under significant stress at her current job, which had a \r\ndirect effect on her diabetes.  The veteran has been granted \r\nservice connection in effect for diabetes mellitus.  In April \r\n2002, a private medical doctor, Dr. J. A. Flores, opined that \r\nthe veteran's psychiatric disorder is due to her diabetes \r\nmellitus.  The doctor further stated that that the veteran \r\nhas a diagnosis of neuropathy (for which service connection \r\nhas also been granted) and experienced pins and needle \r\nsensation over her lower extremities.  The veteran's serum \r\nglucose was difficult to control which lead to brief periods \r\nof hypoglycemia and weight loss.  The doctor concluded that \r\nthis affected her mental health and moreover, she experienced \r\nperiods of depression.  \r\n\r\nIn light of the above evidence, this case was remanded by the \r\nBoard for further development in June 2003.  The Board asked \r\nthat the veteran be scheduled for a VA examination to \r\ndetermine whether any current psychiatric disorder is due to \r\nthe veteran's diabetes or any other service-connected \r\ndisability, or if any pre-existing psychiatric disorder was \r\naggravated by one or more service-connected disabilities.  \r\nThe claims folder indicates that the veteran failed to report \r\nfor the VA examination.  Thus, the Board must decide the case \r\nbased on the available evidence.  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that another medical opinion would have been \r\nhelpful in determining the veteran's claim.  The Board also \r\nhas given consideration to the veteran's reluctance to attend \r\nVA examinations due to an alleged unpleasant past experience, \r\nas evidenced by a May 1999 Report of Contact.  However, the \r\nfact that the veteran's employment situation could have \r\ncontributed to her depression, does not preclude the \r\nveteran's chronic acquired psychiatric disorder from being \r\nproximately due to or the result of her service-connected \r\ndiabetes.  Furthermore, the evidence of record showed that a \r\nNovember 1992 VA medical record revealed the veteran had a \r\ndiagnosis of adjustment disorder, and the July 1997 VA PTSD \r\nexamination provided the veteran with a diagnosis of panic \r\ndisorder with agoraphobia.  In an April 2002 letter, Dr. J. \r\nA. Flores, opined that the veteran's psychiatric disorder is \r\ndue to her diabetes mellitus.  The veteran currently is rated \r\nas 100 percent disabled for her service-connected diabetes \r\nmellitus.  Hence, the evidence has demonstrated that the \r\nveteran's chronic acquired psychiatric disorder, is \r\nproximately due to or the result of her service-connected \r\ndiabetes.  Therefore, in giving the veteran the benefit of \r\nthe doubt, the Board finds that the evidence is in relative \r\nequipoise with regard to the claim.  Therefore, service \r\nconnection is warranted for a chronic acquired psychiatric \r\ndisorder.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b).  \r\n\r\nIn closing, the Board acknowledges the Veterans Claims \r\nAssistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. \r\n2096 (2000), now codified at 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5102, 5103, \r\n5103A, 5107 (West 2002) and implementing regulations at 38 \r\nC.F.R �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326(a) (2003).  The \r\nBoard also acknowledges that various judicial decisions have \r\naddressed the notice and assistance requirement of VCAA.  See \r\ngenerally See Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 \r\n(2002); Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002); Huston \r\nv. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 195, 202 (2003); Paralyzed Veterans \r\nof America v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, 345 F.3d 1334 \r\n(Fed. Cir. 2003).  However, with regard to the benefit being \r\ngranted by the Board in this decision, the Board need not \r\nconsider the question of VCAA compliance since there is no \r\ndetriment to the veteran in light of the favorable \r\ndisposition.  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nThe appeal is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t                        \r\n____________________________________________\r\nV.

Eckart, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from September 1942 to \r\nMarch 1946.  \r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\nfrom a rating decision of September 2001 from the Regional \r\nOffice (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which \r\ndenied entitlement to service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify you if \r\nfurther action is required on your part.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran claims entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD.  Medical records show a diagnosis of PTSD in an April \r\n1999 report, however this diagnosis appears to have been \r\nerroneously based on Vietnam service.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran claims a number of stressors said to have caused \r\nPTSD.  One stressor he testified about in his April 2005 \r\nhearing was an incident shortly after he arrived in Guam \r\naround late 1958, early 1959, when a marine gate guard shot \r\nhimself in the head in close proximity to the veteran.  He \r\nindicated that this took place at the Naval Training Center \r\non Guam.  He testified that he was interviewed by the \r\nmilitary police after this incident.  He indicated that the \r\nonly other stressful incident that took place in Guam was \r\ngetting beaten up by Marines, but noted there was no report \r\nof this incident.  \r\n\r\nHe testified that after serving in Guam, he was stationed \r\nonshore for 9 months in Hawaii serving at Camp Smith under \r\nCINPAC and while there he saw a friend's roomate bleeding and \r\napparently dead on his cot with his wrists slashed.  He \r\nindicated that the Naval Investigative Service investigated \r\nthis incident.  No date was given as to when this took place.  \r\n\r\nThereafter, he was assigned to the U.S.S. Hull, where he was \r\nagain a witness to a suicide by gunshot.  He indicated that \r\nthe sailor who shot himself was on a nearby ship, the U.S.S. \r\nRogers and they were both on deck watch.  He testified that \r\nthis took place around the middle of 1960.  He testified that \r\nhe wrote a report on this incident and submitted it to the \r\nship's log.  Finally, he testified that he witnessed a chief \r\npetty officer lost at sea in a \"highline\" accident when the \r\nindividual was being transferred via a roped chair between \r\ntwo ships.  No date was given as to when this took place, but \r\nindicated that the incident took place between the U.S.S. \r\nOriskany, an aircraft carrier and a supply ship.  The \r\nveteran's ship, the U.S.S. Hull was nearby guarding the \r\nvicinity and the veteran was on guard detail, when he saw the \r\naccident.  \r\n\r\nAlthough there are service personnel records associated with \r\nthe claims file, which verify his service in Guam in late \r\n1958, with CINCPACFLT from around May 1959 to March 1960 and \r\nwith the U.S.S. Hull after March 1960 to around May 1961, no \r\nreal attempt appears to have been made to verify the claimed \r\nstressors.  It is not also clear that the complete service \r\npersonnel records have been obtained.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, in order to ensure further compliance with the \r\nVA's duty to assist, this case is REMANDED to the VBA AMC for \r\nthe following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  The VBA AMC must ask the veteran to \r\nfurther clarify the approximate dates in \r\nwhich he saw the individual who had \r\nslashed his wrists in his cot while he \r\nwas with CINPAC in Camp Smith, in Hawaii.  \r\nHe should also clarify the approximate \r\ndates in which he witnessed the man lost \r\nat sea during a transfer between the \r\nU.S.S. Oriskany and a supply ship, during \r\na time when he was aboard the U.S.S. \r\nHull.  The veteran should be advised to \r\nrequest that his representative send to \r\nthe AMC any supporting evidence in his \r\npossession pertaining to the veteran's \r\nduty assignments on the U.S.S. Hull, and \r\nany pertinent ships logs, duty \r\nassignments, command history and \r\npictures.\r\n\r\n2.  The VBA AMC should contact the \r\nNational Personnel Records Center (NPRC) \r\nand obtain the veteran's complete \r\npersonnel records and duty assignments, \r\nor verification that complete records \r\nhave already been sent.  \r\n\r\n3. Thereafter, the VBA AMC should contact \r\nthe National Archives and Records \r\nAdministration (NARA), and request copies \r\nof the records such as ships logs, duty \r\nassignments, command history, morning \r\nreports, operational reports, lessons \r\nlearned statements, or any other \r\ninformation pertinent to the Naval \r\ntraining center in Guam in late 1958 \r\nearly 1959, CINCPACFLT from between May \r\n1959 to March 1960 and the U.S.S. Hull \r\nfrom March 1960 to around May 1961.   The \r\nincidents of particular interest include \r\nthe alleged gunshot suicide of a Marine \r\nguard at the Naval Training Center in \r\nGuam between late 1958 and early 1959; \r\nand the alleged gunshot suicide in the \r\nmiddle of 1960 by an individual on the \r\nU.S.S. Rogers, said to be recorded in the \r\nU.S.S. Hull's ship's logs.  If the \r\nveteran further clarifies the dates of \r\nthe alleged suicide by wrist cutting at \r\nCamp Smith under CINPAC and the man \r\noverboard incident during a transfer \r\nbetween the U.S.S. Oriskany and a supply \r\nship, during a time when he was aboard \r\nthe U.S.S. Hull, verification these \r\nincidents should also be further \r\nattempted. \r\n\r\n4.  Thereafter, and only if any claimed \r\nstressors are verified, the VBA AMC \r\nshould afford the veteran a VA special \r\npsychiatric examination.  The claims file \r\nmust be made available to and reviewed by \r\nthe examiner in connection with the \r\nexamination.  The examiner must determine \r\nthe nature, severity, and etiology of any \r\npsychiatric disorder(s) present, to \r\ninclude PTSD if present.  The examiner \r\nshould provide an opinion on the \r\nfollowing: \r\n\r\na.  Does the veteran have PTSD?\r\n\r\nb.  If PTSD is diagnosed, the examiner \r\nshould consider only the verified \r\nstressors.  After consideration of these \r\nstressors, the examiner should explain \r\nwhether this satisfies  the criteria to \r\nsupport a diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe report of the examination should \r\ninclude a complete rationale for all \r\nopinions.  The veteran is advised that \r\nfailure to report for a scheduled VA \r\nexamination without good cause shown may \r\nhave adverse effects on his claim.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.655 (2004).\r\n\r\n4.  Thereafter, the VBA AMC should review \r\nthe claims file to ensure that all of the \r\nforegoing requested development has been \r\ncompleted.  In particular, the AMC should \r\nreview the requested examination report \r\nand required medical opinions to ensure \r\nthat they are responsive to and in \r\ncomplete compliance with the directives \r\nof this remand and if they are not, the \r\nAMC should implement corrective \r\nprocedures. The Board errs as a matter of \r\nlaw when it fails to ensure compliance \r\nand further remand will be mandated.  \r\nStegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).\r\n\r\n5.  After undertaking any other \r\ndevelopment deemed essential in addition \r\nto that specified above, the BVA AMC \r\nshould re-adjudicate the veteran's claim.  \r\nIf any benefit sought on appeal remains \r\ndenied, the veteran should be provided a \r\nSupplemental Statement of the Case \r\n(SSOC).  The SSOC must contain notice of \r\nall relevant actions taken on the claim \r\nfor benefits, to include a summary of the \r\nevidence and discussion of all pertinent \r\nregulations not previously provided.  An \r\nappropriate period of time should be \r\nallowed for response.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee The Veterans Benefits Act of 2003, Pub.

The medical evidence does not establish that the veteran \r\nmanifests a diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or by military service.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n�� 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2005); \r\n38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2004).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) describes \r\nVA's duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a \r\nclaim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, \r\n5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2005); 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326(a) (2004).  \r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete \r\napplication for benefits, VA is required to notify the \r\nclaimant and his or her representative, if any, of any \r\ninformation, and any medical or lay evidence, that is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) \r\n(West 2002 & Supp. 2005); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) (2004); \r\nQuartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  Proper VCAA \r\nnotice must inform the claimant of any information and \r\nevidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate \r\nthe claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; (3) that the \r\nclaimant is expected to provide; and (4) must ask the \r\nclaimant to provide any evidence in her or his possession \r\nthat pertains to the claim in accordance with 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.159(b)(1).  VCAA notice should be provided to a claimant \r\nbefore the initial unfavorable agency of original \r\njurisdiction (AOJ) decision on a claim.  Pelegrini v. \r\nPrincipi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004); see also Mayfield v. \r\nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 103 (2005).\r\n\r\nIn Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004), the U.S. \r\nCourt of Appeals for Veterans Claims ((Court) held, in part, \r\nthat a VCAA notice, as required by 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a), \r\nmust be provided to a claimant before the initial unfavorable \r\nagency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on a claim for \r\nVA benefits.  In the present case, the unfavorable AOJ \r\ndecision that is the basis of this appeal was already decided \r\nand appealed prior to VCAA enactment, in February 1993.  The \r\nCourt acknowledged in Pelegrini that where, as here, the \r\n� 5103(a) notice was not mandated at the time of the initial \r\nAOJ decision, the AOJ did not err in not providing such \r\nnotice.  Rather, the appellant has the right to content \r\ncomplying notice and proper subsequent VA process.  \r\nPelegrini, 18 Vet. App. at 120.  \r\n\r\nHowever, in November 2002, the RO issued a supplemental \r\nstatement of the case (SSOC) in which it reconsidered the \r\nveteran's claim under the VCAA.  The RO found that new and \r\nmaterial evidence had been submitted to reopen the previously \r\ndenied claim for service connection for PTSD, but that \r\nsufficient evidence to establish a diagnosis of the \r\ndisability or to allow verification of the claimed stressors \r\nwas not found.  The claim for service connection for PTSD was \r\ndenied.  With the SSOC, the RO also provided notice of the \r\nchanges in law and regulation effected by VCAA.\r\n\r\nThe case came before the Board in October 2003, at which time \r\nthe Board held that new and material evidence to reopen the \r\npreviously denied claim for service connection for PTSD had \r\nbeen received, and remanded the claim of service connection \r\nfor PTSD for further development, including to proffer the \r\nveteran VA examination and to attempt to verify his averred \r\nstressors.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Board's remand, the RO issued a VCAA letter \r\nin February 2004.  This letter addresses the issue of service \r\nconnection for PTSD, but is deficient in that it is unclear \r\nfrom the record whether the appellant was explicitly asked to \r\nprovide \"any evidence in [his] possession that pertains\" to \r\nhis claim.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1).  Nevertheless, as a \r\npractical matter the Board finds that he has been notified of \r\nthe need to provide such evidence, for the following reasons.  \r\nThe AOJ's February 2004 letter informed him that additional \r\ninformation or evidence was needed to support his claim, and \r\nasked him to send the information or evidence to the AOJ.  \r\nThe November 2002 SSOC directly asked the veteran to supply \r\nevidence of a diagnosis of PTSD and to provide information to \r\nenable verification of his claimed stressors.  In addition, \r\nthe November 2002 and April 2005 SSOCs contained the complete \r\ntext of 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1), which includes such notice.  \r\nFurthermore, the RO sent a letter, dated in November 2004, \r\nadvising that the New York, New York VA Medical Center (VAMC) \r\nhad responded that there were no records of treatment \r\naccorded the veteran available.  The RO asked the veteran to \r\nsubmit these records.  The veteran did not respond.  The \r\nveteran did respond to other requests for information, \r\nsubmitting a new stressor statement and an authorization for \r\nthe release of private medical information provided by Mr. \r\nSewell, C.S.W., in December 2004.  The information he \r\nprovided identified no new sources of treatment records.  \r\nRather, the veteran indicated that he believed the VA already \r\nhad all records of treatment provided him by Mr. Sewell.  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the October 2003 remand requested \r\nfurther development by the RO to verify the veteran's \r\nstressors.  In addition, the Board asked the RO to request \r\ntreatment records under both spellings of the veteran's name.  \r\nNeither of these actions was completed.  However, in the \r\npresent case, the Board finds that further remand for \r\ncompliance is not necessary.  This is so because, as will be \r\ndiscussed more fully below, the veteran underwent VA \r\nexamination in April 2005, at which time he was found not to \r\nmanifest PTSD.  Absent a diagnosis of PTSD, it is not \r\nnecessary to verify the averred stressors.  In the case of \r\nthe searching under alternate spellings of the veteran's \r\nname, the Board observes that the veteran's identification \r\nnumber was correctly identified and that in both cases, a \r\nletter and form were both sent out.  Both spellings of the \r\nveteran's name were identified on the form.  Two requests \r\nwere sent to the New York, New York VAMC, and that treatment \r\nrecords were successfully obtained from the VAMC in Albany, \r\nNew York.  Moreover, the veteran was advised of the failure \r\nto locate the records at VAMC New York, New York, and he did \r\nnot offer augmenting information or respond that the records \r\ndid, in fact exist.  Concerning treatment records from Mr. \r\nSewell, the veteran responded, as noted above, that the VA \r\nhad all relevant records already.  Given the foregoing, the \r\nBoard finds that further remand to verify stressors and make \r\nfurther attempts to obtain treatment records from the VAMC in \r\nNew York, New York is not necessary.  See Soyini v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 (1991) (holding that strict \r\nadherence to legal requirements does not dictate an \r\nunquestioning, blind adherence in the face of overwhelming \r\nevidence in support of the result in a particular case \r\nbecause such adherence would impose additional burdens on the \r\nVA with no benefit flowing to the veteran); Sabonis v. Brown, \r\n6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (remands which would only result \r\nin unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no \r\nbenefit flowing to the veteran are to be avoided). VA has \r\nfully satisfied its duties to inform and assist the veteran \r\nas to the claim at issue here; see also 38 C.F.R. � 20.1102 \r\n(2004) (harmless error).   \r\n\r\nFurthermore, under these circumstances, the Board is \r\nsatisfied that the appellant has been adequately informed of \r\nthe need to submit relevant evidence in his possession.\r\n\r\nHere, the Board finds that any defect with respect to the \r\ntiming of the VCAA notice requirement was harmless error.  \r\nAlthough the notice was provided to the appellant after the \r\ninitial adjudication, the appellant has not been prejudiced \r\nthereby.  The content of the notice provided to the appellant \r\nfully complied with the requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) \r\nand 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) regarding VA's duty to notify-other \r\nthan that which was discussed above.  Hence, not only has the \r\nappellant been provided with every opportunity to submit \r\nevidence and argument in support of his claim and to respond \r\nto VA notices, but the actions taken by VA have essentially \r\ncured the error in the timing of notice.  Further, the Board \r\nfinds that the purpose behind the notice requirement has been \r\nsatisfied because the appellant has been afforded a \r\nmeaningful opportunity to participate effectively in the \r\nprocessing of her or his claim.  For these reasons, it is not \r\nprejudicial to the appellant for the Board to proceed to \r\nfinally decide this appeal.  \r\n\r\nService connection may be established for disability \r\nresulting from personal injury or disease incurred in or \r\naggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131 (West \r\n2002).  Regulations also provide that service connection may \r\nbe established where all the evidence of record, including \r\nthat pertinent to service, demonstrates that the veteran's \r\ncurrent disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires the following:  1) \r\nmedical evidence of a diagnosis of PTSD in accordance with \r\nthe criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \r\nDisorders (4th ed., 1994) (DSM-IV), which is presumed to \r\ninclude both adequacy of the PTSD symptomatology and \r\nsufficiency of a claimed inservice stressor; 2) credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed inservice stressor \r\nactually occurred; and 3) medical evidence of a link, or \r\nnexus, between the current symptomatology and the claimed \r\ninservice stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), 4.125 (2004); \r\nCohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 138 (1997).  For the \r\npurposes of establishing service connection, a stressor is a \r\ntraumatic event 1) to which the veteran was exposed during \r\nactive service and in which the veteran \"experienced, \r\nwitnessed, or was confronted with an event or events that \r\ninvolved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a \r\nthreat to the physical integrity of self or others\"; and 2) \r\nwhich produced in the veteran a response involving intense \r\nfear, helplessness, or horror.  Cohen, at 141 (citing DSM-\r\nIV).\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the medical evidence reflects that the \r\nveteran does not currently manifest PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe medical evidence of record shows that the veteran \r\nunderwent VA examination in August 1988, at which time he was \r\nevaluated for a psychiatric condition.  The report shows \r\nobjective observations of an articulate, mildly to moderately \r\nanxious individual, at times overly loquacious, but overly \r\nserious as well.  No hallucinations or delusions were \r\nobserved, and the examiner found no evidence of psychotic \r\nphenomenon.  Organic, recent, and remote memory, as well as \r\nconcentration and attention span were found to be good.  \r\nInsight was found to be fair, judgment, intact.  The veteran \r\nreported symptoms of periodic insomnia, risk taking, lack of \r\nemotional involvement in close relationships, lack of emotion \r\nin general, various obsessions-particularly with regard to \r\nVietnam.  He described feeling depressed and fleeting \r\nsuicidal ideation without intent.  He was able to recognize \r\nthat his self-destructive and harmful behaviors, such as risk \r\ntaking, may represent suicidal behavior.  The veteran \r\nidentified his stressors as including memories of children, \r\ncivilian children feeding off garbage and looking as though \r\nthey were destitute, starved for medical attention, and \r\nstarved for food.  He reported memories of artillery scenes \r\nbut stated that they were peripheral, as he was not himself \r\ninvolved in combat.  He reported receiving no treatment for \r\nhis symptoms.  The examiner noted:\r\n\r\nIn summary, this individual presents with \r\nwhat appears to be a somewhat atypical \r\nbut emerging picture of a post traumatic \r\nstress disorder.  There are times in \r\nwhich he manifests other stigmata such as \r\nincreased startle response and a \r\ndecreased social life, however, these are \r\nnot well born out in the current history. \r\n\r\nThe VA examining psychiatrist diagnosed PTSD, atypical, \r\nchronic and delayed in AXIS I and narcissistic personality \r\ndisorder in AXIS II.  The VA examining general medical \r\nphysician diagnosed no general medical disease in AXIS I and \r\na history of possible PTSD in AXIS II.  There is no \r\nindication that either examiner reviewed the veteran's claims \r\nfile in conjunction with their examinations.\r\n\r\nIn February 1990, the veteran submitted the statements of his \r\nuncle, a friend, and a co-worker.  The statement of his \r\nuncle, dated in January 1990, establishes the uncle's \r\nobservation that the veteran was a normal young man prior to \r\nVietnam.  He had an out-going personality and enjoyed \r\nsocializing.  But these attributes changed as a result of \r\nVietnam, the uncle observed.  The veteran wrote to the uncle \r\nwhile he was in Vietnam, the uncle stated, describing some of \r\nthe events that occurred, including events the veteran avers \r\nnow are his stressors, including the incident wherein a \r\nVietnamese threw a hand grenade into a bar in which the \r\nveteran was with friends.  It did not detonate, but the \r\nVietnamese police reportedly gunned down a number of \r\ncivilians in their efforts to get the man who tossed the \r\ngrenade.  The savagery of these deaths, the uncle said the \r\nveteran wrote, disturbed him.  After the veteran came home, \r\nthe uncle stated, he initially seemed happy and got a job in \r\nsales with a good future, but changed over time.  He began to \r\ntalk about Vietnam.  He quit his job in sales and took a job \r\nwith a factory on the night shift.  He drank on Sundays.  He \r\nbecame more remote from family.  He returned to school and \r\nbecame a Vietnam Veterans peer counselor.  His focus shifted \r\nfrom the war to the government's mistreatment of veterans.  \r\nIt became an obsession.  The uncle observed the veteran came \r\nhome from Vietnam a totally different person.\r\n\r\nThe statement of the veteran's friend, dated in February \r\n1990, who also knew him before he went to Vietnam, concurred, \r\nremembering a pacifist individual, laid back prior to Vietnam \r\nand very changed after.  The friend stated that the veteran \r\nalso described to him the incident involving the hand grenade \r\nand the police killing civilians in an effort to get the guy \r\nwho threw the grenade.  The friend noted that the veteran was \r\nobsessed with this event after the war.\r\n\r\nThe statement of the co-worker, dated in February 1990, \r\nstates that he met the veteran after Vietnam when both were \r\nstudents.  He said that he would meet with the veteran and a \r\ngroup of his other Vietnam veteran friends, and on one \r\noccasion they discussed their war experiences openly.  The \r\nveteran later admitted to the friend that he felt very guilty \r\nat having survived the Vietnam War without being wounded.  He \r\nsaid that eleven men from his hometown had been killed.  He \r\nshared the experience involving the grenade, stating that was \r\nthe closest he came to being hurt, but that innocent women \r\nand children had been killed.  He stated he was haunted by \r\nhis apparent immunity to injury.\r\n\r\nIn March 1994, the veteran's treating social worker, Kenneth \r\nSewell, M.S.W., C.S.W., submitted a statement indicating that \r\nhe had treated the veteran for four years.  He offered the \r\nfollowing observations:\r\n\r\nThis person has exhibited most of the \r\nsymptoms of PTSD including numerous bouts \r\nof depression in which he suffers sleep \r\nand appetite disturbances and a loss of \r\ninterest in activities normally enjoyed.  \r\nHe has a history of rocky relationships \r\nthat are short-lived including two \r\nmarriages and two live-in girlfriends.  \r\nHe oftentimes alienates himself from \r\nothers, he is very isolative at times and \r\nputs an enormous amount of time and \r\neffort into helping other Vietnam \r\nveterans.  This has been the cause of the \r\nend of at least one marriage and two \r\nother relationships.  He reports an \r\nexaggerated startle response and numerous \r\nepisodes of rage.\r\n\r\n... From working with and knowing him over \r\nthe past four years I can agree that he \r\nsuffers from Post Traumatic Stress \r\nDisorder directly related to his military \r\nexperience in Vietnam ... I find that he \r\nsuffers much guilt from his experiences \r\nand assumes much blame for the death of \r\nseveral of his friends.  This is directly \r\nrelated to the trauma he suffered at the \r\nhands of his own comrades.  His life has \r\nbeen adversely affected by this traumatic \r\nexperience and causes him much pain to \r\nthis date.\r\n\r\nIn August 1994, Mr. Sewell offered a second statement in \r\nwhich he noted that the veteran had been divorced, and that \r\nhis PTSD symptoms contributed to his divorce.  Although \r\nunemployed, he continued to help Vietnam veterans in an \r\neffort to deal with his survival guilt.  The social worker \r\nnoted that the veteran continued to experience survival guilt \r\nand periods of rage, to abuse alcohol, and to isolate and \r\nalienate others unless to serve a Vietnam veteran.  \r\n\r\nAlthough [the veteran] is an intelligent \r\nman and has substantial experience in the \r\nfield of human services, he is unable to \r\nsecure gainful employment at this time \r\nand has not shown by history an ability \r\nmaintain any position.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience with working with PTSD \r\nvictems (sic), I find that [the veteran] \r\nindeed meets the new DSM:  IV criteria \r\nfor PTSD and can show how his war time \r\nexperiences relate to his having said \r\nillness.  I believe that his work history \r\ncan also point to his PTSD affecting his \r\nindustrial adaptability as well as his \r\nsocial adaptability.\r\n\r\nI believe that [the veteran's] service \r\nrelated disabilities leave him socially \r\nand industrially disabled.\r\n\r\nIn March 1998, the veteran underwent further VA examination.  \r\nThe examiner stated that he reviewed the veteran's records in \r\nconjunction with examining the veteran.  In particular, the \r\nexaminer reviewed a statement the veteran provided in March \r\n1989 identifying his stressors, and the examiner concurred \r\nthat these stressors would be sufficient to account for a \r\nlater development of PTSD.  However, the examiner noted that \r\nhis examination of the veteran did not reveal much evidence \r\nof such a disorder currently.\r\n\r\nThe veteran reported additional symptoms of feeling that \r\nthere are things he should have done in Vietnam that he did \r\nnot do.  The unit he trained with went into combat and many \r\nwere killed and injured.  But the veteran was removed from \r\nthat unit and assigned to another one and did not see combat.  \r\nHis culture, the veteran explained, considered it unmanly to \r\nback away from a fight.  The examiner noted that the veteran \r\ndid not express any upsetting dreams or flashbacks, and the \r\nexaminer opined that the symptomatology described was fairly \r\nmild and did not much related to PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe examiner objectively observed the veteran to talk very \r\neasily and to be quite composed.  The examiner found no sign \r\nof anxiety or of the veteran being upset.  The veteran was \r\nrelevant in response to direct questions and his affect \r\nseemed appropriate.  There was no sign of thought disorder.  \r\nHe was fully oriented and exhibited no memory impairment.  \r\nThe veteran reported no treatment for his condition.\r\n\r\nThe examiner found no disorder in AXIS I and in AXIS II \r\npersonality disorder not otherwise specified.  In AXIS IV, \r\nthe examiner noted concern about not having been in combat.  \r\nHe offered the following opinion:\r\n\r\nAll in all, I do not see this patient as \r\nbeing particularly disturbed and \r\ncertainly I see no basis for diagnosing \r\nhim as having post-traumatic stress \r\ndisorder.  More than anything, he seems \r\nto have had some kind of a personality \r\ndisorder which probably predates his \r\nmilitary experience and has affected his \r\nrelationships with women.  He has a thing \r\nabout his manliness and I think that his \r\nconcerns about Vietnam are largely \r\nrelated to the fact that his failure to \r\nparticipate in combat with the others may \r\nhave called him to question his manliness \r\nand I think his later risk-taking \r\nbehavior is similarly related to this \r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the record presents evidence of the \r\ncontinuity of the presentation of some observed behavior \r\nwhich differed from that behavior the veteran exhibited prior \r\nto entrance to active service, as established by statements \r\nafforded by the veteran's uncle and friend.  Moreover, the \r\nrecord presents evidence of observation of some symptoms and \r\na diagnosis of PTSD by the social worker, as well as by the \r\nAugust 1988 VA examination report, albeit the examiner then \r\nqualified his diagnosis by describing the PTSD exhibited by \r\nthe veteran as atypical and emerging.  Given the discrepancy \r\nbetween this diagnosis and that presented in March 1998, and \r\nthe conflict between the March 1998 VA examination report and \r\nMr. Sewell's findings, the Board, after reopening the \r\npreviously denied claim in its October 2003 decision, \r\nremanded the issue for further development, including to \r\nobtain VA treatment records and to accord the veteran a VA \r\nexamination with review of the entire record.\r\n\r\nThe resultant VA examination, dated in April 2005, is of \r\nrecord.  The examiner stated he had reviewed the veteran's \r\nclaims file, and referenced both Mr. Sewell's report and the \r\nprevious, 1998 VA examination report.  The veteran reported \r\nreceiving counseling in the 90s secondary to marital problems \r\nin which he discussed some of his PTSD issues, but stated \r\nthat he never returned for psychiatric treatment.  He \r\nreported he was not presently receiving any psychiatric \r\ntreatment.  The veteran described himself as usually happy \r\nbut angrier since the Iraq war.  He stated he had had periods \r\nof detachment, but more in the past.  He stated he \r\nexperienced no distressing dreams or flashbacks of his \r\nVietnam experiences, and that he does not seem to avoid \r\nthoughts or activities associated with any real trauma.  For \r\ninstance, the examiner explained, the veteran will get very \r\nangry about the Iraq war and may debate it with someone, but \r\nhe is not distressed or depressed about it.  The veteran \r\nreported no difficulty with sleep or concentration.  He \r\ndescribed having some hypervigilance but no exaggerated \r\nstartle response.\r\n\r\nThe examiner observed the veteran to present as somewhat \r\nanxious but oriented times three.  Speech was observed to be \r\nspontaneous, logical, and relevant; recent and remote memory, \r\nintact.  No indication of thought disorder, delusions, or \r\nhallucinations were evidenced or reported.  The veteran \r\ndenied impaired impulse control, depression, suicidal or \r\nhomicidal ideations, and anxiety or panic attacks.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner found the veteran did not fully meet the \r\ncriteria for PTSD, as designated in the Diagnostic and \r\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Ed., 1994) (DSM-\r\nIV) and, rather, found the veteran to be functioning rather \r\nwell, except for some irritability.\r\n\r\nThe examiner found the veteran to exhibit no diagnosis in \r\nAXIS I or II.\r\n\r\nVA treatment records reflect complaints of and treatment of \r\nother conditions, such as hypercholesterolemia and seborrheic \r\nkeratotic lesions, but not treatment for or diagnosis of \r\nPTSD.\r\n\r\nThe Board has considered all the medical evidence of record \r\nand finds that the veteran does not manifest PTSD.  In coming \r\nto this conclusion, the Board gives more probative weight to \r\nthe April 2005 VA examination report, which was conducted \r\nmost recently and by a psychologist whose opinion was \r\ninformed by examination of the veteran in addition to review \r\nof the entire claims file-to include treatment records, \r\nprevious evaluations of the veteran, and the statements \r\nproffered by Mr. Sewell and the veteran's witnesses.  In \r\naddition, the Board notes that the April 2005 report \r\ncorroborates the findings of the March 1998 VA examination \r\nreport, which was similarly informed by a review of the \r\nmedical record and reflects findings of no disorder in AXIS \r\nI.\r\n\r\nAssuming, without finding, that the August 1988 VA \r\nexamination report established a diagnosis of PTSD, the Board \r\nyet observes that the August 1988 VA examination report was \r\nconducted absent review of the veteran's claims file.  \r\nNonetheless, the Board points out that the diagnosis \r\nproffered by the August 1988 report was not a clear one.  The \r\nexaminer, a psychiatrist and M.D., qualified the diagnosis by \r\nstating that the picture of PTSD the veteran then presented \r\nwas one of an emerging disorder, rather than one that was \r\nimmediately present.  Moreover, the diagnosis proffered by \r\nthe general medical examiner noted a history possible of PTSD \r\nrather than a current diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\nHence, the only clear diagnosis of PTSD presented in the \r\nrecord is that proffered by the veteran's social worker, Mr. \r\nSewell.  Mr. Sewell is not a psychiatrist or a psychologist.  \r\nWhile the Board acknowledges Mr. Sewell's expertise as a \r\nsocial worker, the Board observes that his qualifications are \r\nsimply not that of a psychiatrist or a psychologist.  \r\nMoreover, the Board observes that his statement, while \r\ninformed by treatment of the veteran over four years, was not \r\ninformed by an independent review of the veteran's claims \r\nfile, including his medical record.  Mr. Sewell's opinion \r\ncannot, therefore, carry the probative weight as the opinions \r\nof the March 1998 and April 2005 VA examining psychologists.\r\n\r\nThe medical evidence presents no other findings, opinions, or \r\nother expert medical evidence establishing that the veteran \r\nmanifests PTSD that may be attributed to his experiences \r\nduring active service in Vietnam.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Board regretfully finds that the medical \r\nevidence cannot establish that the veteran manifests PTSD \r\nthat is the result of his active service.\r\n\r\nWhere, as here, the claim turns on a medical matter, the \r\nveteran cannot establish entitlement to service connection on \r\nthe basis of his assertions, alone.  As a layperson, without \r\nappropriate medical training and expertise, the veteran \r\nsimply is not competent to offer a probative opinion on a \r\nmedical matter, such as whether he manifests PTSD that may be \r\netiologically linked to service.  Consequently, his \r\nstatements are competent with regard to his subjective \r\ncomplaints and his history, but they do not constitute \r\ncompetent medical evidence for the purpose of establishing \r\ncurrent disability, or of showing a causal connection between \r\ncurrent complaints and service.  See Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 \r\nVet. App. 492 (1992); Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91 \r\n(1993).  \r\n\r\nWith regret, the Board finds that absent medical evidence \r\nsupporting a current diagnosis of PTSD, the Board is not able \r\nto find that the veteran manifests PTSD that is the result of \r\nhis active service.\r\n\r\nHence, as the medical evidence does not reflect that the \r\nveteran currently manifests PTSD, the preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against finding that the veteran manifests PTSD \r\nthat may be etiologically related to his active service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131, 5102, 5103, 5103A, and 5107; 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.102, 3.303, 3.3.07, 3.309, 3.385.  See Brammer v. \r\nDerwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  See also Espiritu, \r\nsupra. \r\n\r\nAfter review of the record, and for the reasons and bases \r\nexpressed above, the Board concludes that the preponderance \r\nof the evidence is against the veteran's claim for \r\nentitlement to service connection for PTSD.  The benefits \r\nsought on appeal is accordingly denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t                        \r\n____________________________________________\r\n\tA.

R. Fletcher\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from September 1972 to \r\nSeptember 1973.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a December 1998 rating decision by the \r\nCleveland, Ohio Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional \r\nOffice (RO).  This case was before the Board in February 2001 \r\nwhen it was remanded for additional development.\r\n\r\nIn the February 2001 remand, the RO was directed to issue a \r\nstatement of the case addressing the issue of whether new and \r\nmaterial evidence has been received to reopen a claim for \r\nservice connection for psychiatric disability other than \r\nPTSD.  Later that same month, the RO issued a statement of \r\nthe case (SOC).  Although the RO characterized the issue as \r\nentitlement to service connection for depression, the SOC \r\ncited 38 C.F.R. � 3.156(a) and the RO stated that no new and \r\nmaterial evidence had been submitted to reopen the veteran's \r\npreviously denied claim.  Thereafter, in a statement received \r\nby the RO in April 2001, the veteran stated that he did not \r\nwish to pursue an appeal of this issue.  \r\n\r\nMore recently, in a statement received by the RO in June \r\n2004, the veteran maintained that he was entitled to service \r\nconnection for depression, hallucinations and paranoid \r\nschizophrenia.  Although the RO issued a rating decision \r\ndenying service connection for paranoid schizophrenia with \r\nhallucinations in May 2005, the issue of whether new and \r\nmaterial evidence has been received to reopen a claim for \r\nservice connection for depression has not been developed for \r\nappellate review.  This issue is referred to the RO for \r\nappropriate action.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn the February 2001 remand, the Board directed the RO to \r\nprepare a summary of the veteran's alleged stressors.  \r\nThereafter, the RO was to forward the stressor information, \r\nand a copy of the service records documenting the veteran's \r\nunit assignments (specifically, the military records of Naval \r\nFighter Squadron (VF-96) and the U.S.S. Constellation (CVA-\r\n64) for the period during which the veteran served on active \r\nduty (September 1972 - September 1973)), to the United States \r\nArmed Services Center for Unit Records Research (USASCURR) \r\nfor verification.  In addition, the Board directed the RO to \r\narrange for the veteran to be scheduled for a VA examination \r\nin order to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn December 2001, the RO obtained the veteran's service \r\npersonnel records, which note that the veteran was assigned \r\nto CVA-64 from December 10, 1972, to February 9, 1973.  \r\nThereafter, he was assigned to VF-96 from February 10, 1973, \r\nto August 13, 1973.\r\n\r\nBy letter dated in November 2002, the RO forwarded the \r\nveteran's alleged stressors to USASCURR.  The RO indicated \r\nthat, according to the veteran, all the alleged stressors \r\noccurred during 1973.  In a June 2003 response, USASCURR \r\nadvised VA that the information provided was insufficient for \r\nconducting meaningful research of the veteran's alleged \r\nstressors.  USASCURR specifically stated that they needed \r\ndates within 60 days of the alleged stressors in order to \r\nperform research.\r\n\r\nIn December 2004, the veteran failed to report for a \r\nscheduled VA PTSD examination.\r\n\r\nIn an August 2005 informal hearing presentation, the \r\nveteran's representative maintained that the RO's November \r\n2002 development letter to the RO was inadequate because the \r\nRO incorrectly named the veteran's ship in the letter.  The \r\nrepresentative also submitted a record recounting the \r\ndeployments of the U.S.S. Constellation along with a waiver \r\nof RO consideration of the additional evidence (see 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 20.1304(c) (effective October 4, 2004).  This record shows \r\nthat the veteran's Naval squadron, VF-96, was deployed to the \r\nU.S.S. Constellation from January 5, 1973, to October 11, \r\n1973.\r\n\r\nAlso in the August 2005 informal hearing presentation, the \r\nveteran's representative maintained that, although the \r\nveteran had failed to report for the December 2004 VA \r\nexamination, he had not been specifically advised of the \r\nconsequences (under 38 C.F.R. � 3.655) of his refusal to \r\nundergo further VA medical examinations.  In Connolly v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 566 (1991), the Court held that if VA \r\nfailed to explain to the veteran the importance of a \r\ndefinitive diagnosis and thus failed to give the veteran the \r\nopportunity to make an informed decision regarding whether to \r\nundergo additional examination, then VA violated its duty to \r\nassist.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Board finds that the RO should once again \r\nschedule the veteran for a VA psychiatric examination.  \r\nBecause of the veteran's failure to cooperate in the past, he \r\nis hereby advised that failure to report to any scheduled VA \r\nexamination, without good cause, may well result in a denial \r\nof his claim.  Examples of good cause include, but are not \r\nlimited to, the illness or hospitalization of the claimant \r\nand death of an immediate family member.  See 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.655.  If the veteran fails to report to any scheduled \r\nexamination, the RO should obtain and associate with the \r\nrecord any notice(s) of the examination(s) sent to the \r\nveteran.\r\n\r\nThe Board regrets any further delay in this case.  However, \r\nthe Board concludes that additional development of the record \r\nis required prior to appellate disposition.\r\n\r\nIn light of these circumstances, the case is hereby REMANDED \r\nto the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC) in \r\nWashington, DC, for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO or AMC should request the \r\nveteran to provide more specific dates \r\nfor his alleged stressors.  The veteran \r\nshould be informed that dates within 60 \r\ndays of the alleged stressors were needed \r\nin order to perform research.\r\n\r\n2.  After providing the veteran with an \r\nopportunity to respond, the RO or the AMC \r\nshould forward the veteran's pertinent \r\nstressor information of record (including \r\ncopies of the veteran's service personnel \r\nrecords and a listing of alleged \r\nstressors) to the USASCURR and request \r\nthat that organization attempt to verify \r\nthe claimed stressors.  If the veteran \r\nhas not provided more specific dates for \r\nhis alleged stressors, the RO or AMC \r\nshould break the time period from January \r\n1973 through September 1973 into 60-day \r\nsearch periods for USASCURR.\r\n\r\n3.  Thereafter, the veteran should be \r\nafforded a VA psychiatric examination to \r\nconfirm or rule out the presence of PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe claims file, to include a copy of \r\nthis Remand, must be made available to \r\nand be reviewed by the examiner.  The \r\nexamination and the report thereof should \r\nbe in accordance with DSM-IV.  Following \r\nexamination of the veteran, review of his \r\npertinent medical history, and with \r\nconsideration of sound medical \r\nprinciples, the examiner should identify \r\nall currently present acquired \r\npsychiatric disorders.  If PTSD is \r\ndiagnosed, the examiner should identify \r\nthe specific stressor(s) upon which the \r\ndiagnosis is based.  If PTSD is not \r\ndiagnosed, the examiner should explain \r\nwhy the veteran does not meet the \r\ncriteria for this diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThe examiner should set forth the \r\ncomplete rationale for all opinions \r\nexpressed and conclusions reached, in a \r\ntypewritten report.\r\n\r\n3.  If the veteran fails to report to any \r\nscheduled examination(s), the RO or AMC \r\nshould obtain and associate with the \r\nrecord any notice(s) of the \r\nexamination(s) sent to the veteran.\r\n\r\n4.  The RO or the AMC should also \r\nundertake any other development it \r\ndetermines to be warranted.  \r\n\r\n5.  Thereafter, the RO or AMC should \r\nreadjudicate the issue on appeal in light \r\nof all pertinent evidence and legal \r\nauthority.  If the veteran fails to \r\nreport for VA examination, the RO should \r\napply the provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 3.655 \r\nas appropriate.  Full reasons and bases \r\nfor the determination must be provided.  \r\n\r\n6.  If the benefit sought on appeal is \r\nnot granted to the veteran's \r\nsatisfaction, the RO or the AMC should \r\nissue to the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative a supplemental statement \r\nof the case (to include a discussion of \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.655, if appropriate) and \r\nafford them the appropriate opportunity \r\nfor response before the claims file is \r\nreturned to the Board for further \r\nappellate consideration.  \r\n\r\nBy this remand the Board intimates no opinion as to any final \r\noutcome warranted.\r\n\r\nNo action is required of the appellant until he is otherwise \r\nnotified but he has the right to submit additional evidence \r\nand argument on the matter that the Board has remanded.  See \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee The Veterans Benefits Act of 2003, Pub.

Costello, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n The appellant served on active duty from July 1968 to \r\nJanuary 1969, and from June 1969 to October 1970.  He also \r\nhad active-duty-for-training from April 1968 to July 1968.  \r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the \r\nBoard) on appeal from an August 2003 rating decision of the \r\nColumbia, South Carolina, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \r\nRegional Office (RO).\r\n\r\nIn June 2005, a video conference hearing on appeal was held, \r\nwith the veteran sitting in Columbia, South Carolina, before \r\nthe undersigned, who is the Acting Veterans Law Judge \r\ndesignated by the Chairman to conduct that hearing.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 7107(c) (West 2002).  A transcript of the \r\nhearing is of record.\r\n\r\nPer 38 U.S.C.A. 7722 (West 2002), the VA has an obligation to \r\ninform individuals of their potential entitlement to VA \r\nbenefits when they meet the statutory definition of an \r\neligible veteran, and the VA is reasonably aware that said \r\nveteran is potentially entitled to VA benefits.  In this \r\nsituation, the record suggests that the veteran may be \r\neligible for service connection for a prostate disorder, to \r\ninclude prostate cancer, secondary to exposure to Agent \r\nOrange.  The record reflects that the veteran has previously \r\nsubmitted a claim for entitlement to service connection for a \r\nprostate disorder, to include prostate cancer, secondary to \r\nexposure to Agent Orange.  The RO has denied the veteran's \r\nclaim stating that since the veteran was not physically \r\nlocated in the Republic of Vietnam, i.e., not on the ground, \r\nhe was not entitled to benefits.  A review of 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.307 (a)(6)(iii) (2005) states that service in Vietnam \r\nincludes the service in the waters offshore.  The veteran \r\nserved aboard the USS Ranger (CVA-61) and this vessel served \r\noffshore North and South Vietnam.  As such, the veteran may \r\nbe entitled to additional compensation benefits.  Thus, in \r\naccordance with 38 U.S.C.A. 7722 (West 2002), the veteran is \r\nprovided notice that he, if he so desires, may apply for said \r\nbenefits.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the veteran \r\nif further action is required on the part of the veteran.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran has asserted that he now suffers from a \r\npsychiatric disorder that has been diagnosed as a bipolar \r\ndisorder with PTSD traits.  He has also, most recently, been \r\ndiagnosed as suffering from PTSD.  \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Veterans Claims Assistance Act (VCAA), 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126 (West \r\n2002 & Supp. 2005), VA first has a duty to notify the \r\nappellant and the accredited representative of any \r\ninformation and evidence necessary to substantiate his/her \r\nclaims for VA benefits.  See generally 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5102, \r\n5103 (West 2002 & Supp. 2005); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) (2005).  \r\nFurthermore, the VA has a duty to assist the appellant in \r\nobtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the claims, \r\nalthough the ultimate responsibility for furnishing evidence \r\nrests with the appellant.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A (West 2002 \r\n& Supp. 2005); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c) (2005).\r\n\r\nThe VCAA requires that VA must provide notice that informs \r\nthe claimant (1) of any information and evidence not of \r\nrecord that is necessary to substantiate the claim, (2) of \r\nthe information and evidence that VA will seek to provide, \r\nand (3) of the information and evidence that the claimant is \r\nexpected to provide.  Furthermore, VA must \"also request \r\nthat the claimant provide any evidence in the claimant's \r\npossession that pertains to the claim.\"  38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n5103(a) (West 2002 & Supp. 2005); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1) \r\n(2005).\r\n\r\nThe Board first notices that the veteran's claim folder does \r\nnot contain the veteran's service medical records.  Without \r\nthose records, which may include service treatment for \r\npsychiatric complaints, the Board cannot adequately assess \r\nwhether any of the claimed psychiatric disorders began in, \r\nwere caused by, or aggravated during his active period of \r\nservice.  As such, the claim must be remanded for the purpose \r\nof obtaining those records, if they still exist.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the record reflects that in 1969 and 1970, the \r\nveteran was assigned to the USS Ranger (CVA-61), a Forrestal \r\nclass aircraft carrier that was part of the Seventh Fleet in \r\nthe western Pacific Ocean.  The veteran has asserted that \r\nwhile on the aircraft carrier, he witnessed a plane crash, a \r\nman being blown off the ship's deck, and a man being \"sucked \r\nup\" in an aircraft engine.  This information was sent to the \r\nUS Armed Services Center for Unit Records Research, of the \r\nDepartment of the Army, which did respond in May 2002.  In \r\nthat response, the Center confirmed that an aviation \r\nordnanceman was sucked into the intake of an A-7 jet and a \r\npilot crashed in an A-7B jet just off the ship's port side.  \r\nThe Center further suggested that the veteran be contacted \r\nand told that he needed to provide additional information on \r\nhis claim so that the claimed stressors could be verified.  A \r\nreview of the claims folder indicates that after the RO \r\nreceived the May 2002 letter, it never went back to the \r\nveteran requesting the additional information.\r\n\r\nTo add to this, the veteran has been given a diagnosis of a \r\nbipolar disorder with PTSD traits and PTSD.  A VA health \r\nprovider, in July 2001, stated that in his opinion the \r\nveteran's bipolar disorder began while the veteran was in the \r\nservice but said disorder was unrecognized and masked by \r\nalcohol use.  A VA medical treatment record from December \r\n2003 and another of January 2004 both contain diagnoses of \r\nPTSD.  There is no indication from the claims folder that the \r\nRO ever attempted to clarify either diagnosis, or to obtain \r\nclarification as to which diagnosis was correct.  The Board \r\nbelieves that such development and clarification is required \r\nby the VA and goes towards fulfilling the VA's duty to assist \r\nthe veteran in the development of his claim.  Without that \r\ndevelopment, the Board and the RO can not objectively \r\nconclude whether the veteran's assertions have merit.  Hence, \r\nthe claim is remanded for the purpose of obtaining this \r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe record also indicates that none of the examiners who have \r\ntreated the veteran for PTSD have ever confirmed the \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD is due to the stressors reported by the \r\nveteran.  The Board notes that the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held in West v. Brown, 7 \r\nVet. App. 70 (1994), in effect, that a psychiatric evaluation \r\nbased upon an incomplete or questionable history is \r\ninadequate for rating purposes and frustrates the efforts of \r\njudicial review.\r\n\r\nIf it is determined that the veteran did not engage in \r\ncombat, credible supporting evidence from any source showing \r\nthat his claimed in-service stressor actually occurred is \r\nrequired for him to prevail.  See Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. \r\nApp. 128, (1997); Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 396 \r\n(1996); Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, 290 (1994).  Under \r\nsuch circumstances, the veteran's lay testimony regarding the \r\nstressor would thus be insufficient, standing alone, to \r\nestablish service connection.  See Moreau, 9 Vet. App. at \r\n395.  Rather, a service stressor must be established by \r\nofficial service records or other credible supporting \r\nevidence.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2003); Pentecost v. \r\nPrincipi, 16 Vet. App. 124 (2002).  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the veteran has supplied a written \r\nstatement describing the traumatic events he experienced in \r\nservice.  Although the RO attempted to collect some \r\ninformation, upon reviewing the claims folder, it appears \r\nthat additional information should be obtained.  Moreover, \r\neven though the veteran's stressors have not been confirmed, \r\nnumerous VA doctors have diagnosed the veteran has suffering \r\nfrom PTSD.  To ensure that the VA has met its duty to assist \r\nthe veteran in developing the facts pertinent to his claim, \r\nin accordance with the Veterans VCAA, and to ensure full \r\ncompliance with due process requirements, this case must be \r\nREMANDED to the RO for the further development of evidence.\r\n\r\nFinally, the claims folder reflects that the veteran is \r\nreceiving benefits from the Social Security Administration \r\n(SSA).  It is unclear as to why the veteran is in receipt of \r\nSSA benefits.  Moreover, there is no indication in the claims \r\nfolder that the SSA has been contacted with respect to the \r\nveteran's claim.  Since the VA has been given notice that the \r\nveteran is in receipt of SSA benefits, those records must be \r\nobtained and associated in the claims folder.  See Lind v. \r\nPrincipi, 3 Vet. App. 443, 494 (1992) (\"When . . . VA is put \r\non notice . . . of the existence of SSA records, . . . VA \r\nmust seek to obtain those records before proceeding with the \r\nappeal.\"); Murincsak v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 363, 370-72 \r\n(1992) (VA has a duty to attempt to secure all records of the \r\nSSA regarding the veteran's determination of unemployability \r\nfor SSA purposes).  These records must be obtained because \r\nthey may provide additional insight into the veteran's \r\npsychiatric disorder.  Thus, the claim must also be returned \r\nto the RO for the purpose of obtaining those SSA records.\r\n\r\nOnce those records have been obtained and reviewed by the RO, \r\nthe RO has a duty to notify a claimant of information or lay \r\nor medical evidence, in addition to the SSA records, is \r\nnecessary to substantiate a claim and to indicate what \r\nportion of the information or evidence is to be provided by \r\nthe claimant and what part the Secretary will attempt to \r\nobtain.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) (West 2002 & Supp. 2005).  \r\nSince the RO has not had the opportunity to provide this \r\ninformation, the claim must be returned to the RO for \r\nadditional processing.  That is, the veteran should be told \r\nwhat information or evidence is needed to substantiate his \r\nclaim in light of all the documents that are being obtained \r\nby means of this remand.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, further appellate consideration will be deferred \r\nand this case is REMANDED to the RO for the following \r\nactions:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should obtain photocopies of \r\nall service medical records of the \r\nveteran, particular those for treatment \r\nduring the years 1969 and 1970.  When \r\nrequesting those records, the RO should \r\nmake sure that it uses the veteran's \r\ncurrent full name and the name he was \r\nknown thereby while in the US Navy.  Of \r\nspecial interest is the veteran's \r\ndischarge physical which has not been \r\nincluded in the claims folder.  If any of \r\nthese records have been retired, the RO \r\nshould attempt to obtain the retired \r\nrecords from the National Personnel \r\nRecords Center, NPRC, in St. Louis, \r\nMissouri, or the appropriate retirement \r\nfacility.  If no records exist, it should \r\nbe so noted in the record.\r\n\r\n2.  The RO should contact the veteran and \r\nask that he identify all sources of \r\nmedical treatment received since he was \r\nreleased from active duty in October 1970 \r\nto the present, and to furnish signed \r\nauthorizations for release to the VA of \r\nprivate medical records in connection \r\nwith each non-VA source identified.  \r\nCopies of the medical records from all \r\nsources, including VA records, (not \r\nalready in the claims folder) should then \r\nbe requested.  All records obtained \r\nshould be added to the claims folder.  If \r\nrequests for any private treatment \r\nrecords are not successful, the RO should \r\ninform the veteran of the nonresponse so \r\nthat he will have an opportunity to \r\nobtain and submit the records himself, in \r\nkeeping with his responsibility to submit \r\nevidence in support of his claim.  38 CFR \r\n� 3.159 (2005).\r\n\r\n3.  The RO should obtain from Social \r\nSecurity Administration the records \r\npertinent to any disability claim as well \r\nas the medical records relied upon for \r\nthat determination.  Only those records \r\nthat are not already included in the \r\nclaims folder should be requested.  All \r\nrecords obtained should be added to the \r\nclaims folder.\r\n\r\n4.  The RO should request that the \r\nveteran provide another written statement \r\nconcerning his experience while serving \r\non the USS Ranger (CVA-61).  The veteran \r\nshould be advised that this information \r\nis vitally necessary to obtain supportive \r\nevidence on the stressful events and he \r\nmust be asked to be as specific as \r\npossible.  The RO should provide to the \r\nveteran copies of the veteran's previous \r\nstatements so that the veteran can use \r\nthose documents to refresh his memories \r\nand also add any additional information \r\nthat he may have forgotten in those \r\ndocuments.  He should be informed that, \r\nwithout such details, an adequate search \r\nfor verifying information cannot be \r\nconducted.  He should be further advised \r\nthat a failure to respond may result in \r\nan adverse action against his claim.  The \r\nRO should note in the record the \r\nresponses provided by the veteran.\r\n\r\nThe RO should specifically ask that the \r\nveteran elaborate on the following \r\nassertions:\r\n\r\na.  During his statement of May 2000, the \r\nveteran stated that he saw a plane crash, \r\na man blown off the ship, and a man \r\nsucked into a plane engine.  The veteran \r\nmust specify whether these individuals \r\nwere members of his subunit while on the \r\ncarrier.  That is, was the veteran a \r\nmember of any of these men's squadrons or \r\ndivisions?  \r\n\r\nb.  The veteran should attempt to provide \r\nas much detail as possible including \r\nwhere he was positions on the deck of the \r\nship when this occurred, were the \r\nincidents talked about after their \r\noccurrences, did his job change any as a \r\nresult of these accidents, etcetera.  \r\n\r\nc.  The veteran should further describe \r\nhow the incidents described above \r\naffected him while he was in the US Navy.  \r\n\r\n5.  Following the above, the RO must make \r\na specific determination, based upon the \r\ncomplete record, with respect to whether \r\nthe appellant was exposed to a stressor \r\nor stressors in service, and, if so, the \r\nnature of the specific stressor or \r\nstressors.  The RO must specifically \r\nrender a finding as to whether the record \r\nestablishes the existence of a stressor \r\nor stressors.  Moreover, the RO must \r\nspecify what stressor or stressors in \r\nservice it has determined are established \r\nby the record.  In reaching this \r\ndetermination, the RO should address any \r\ncredibility questions raised by the \r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n6.  The RO should arrange for the veteran \r\nto be examined by a psychiatrist, who has \r\nnot previously examined him, to determine \r\nthe correct diagnosis of any psychiatric \r\ndisorder.  The RO must specify, for the \r\nexaminer, the stressor or stressors that \r\nthe RO has determined are established by \r\nthe record.  The examiner must be \r\ninstructed that only those events may be \r\nconsidered for the purpose of determining \r\nwhether the appellant was exposed to a \r\nstressor or stressors in service.  If the \r\nexaminer determines that the veteran has \r\nany psychiatric disorder in addition to \r\nPTSD, the examiner should determine the \r\nrelationship of any such disorders among \r\nthemselves (including etiological origin \r\nand secondary causation) and specify \r\nwhich symptoms are associated with each \r\ndisorder.  If certain symptomatology \r\ncannot be disassociated from one disorder \r\nor the other, it should be so specified.\r\n\r\nIf a diagnosis of PTSD is appropriate, \r\nthe examiner should state whether that \r\ndisorder was caused by the in-service \r\nstressors found to be established for the \r\nrecord by the RO and found to be \r\nsufficient to produce PTSD by the \r\nexaminer.\r\n\r\nIf the examiner concludes that the \r\nveteran does not suffer from full-blown \r\nPTSD, but instead suffers from a bipolar \r\ndisorder with PTSD traits, the examiner \r\nmust proffer an opinion [more than \r\nlikely, less than likely, or as likely as \r\nnot] as to whether any of the non-PTSD \r\ncondition is related to the veteran's \r\nmilitary service or any incident therein.  \r\nIn discussing this point, the examiner \r\nmust reference the veteran's VA medical \r\ntreatment records, including the July \r\n2001 report that found that the bipolar \r\ndisorder began while the veteran was in \r\nthe US Navy.  \r\n\r\nThe report of the examination should \r\ninclude a complete rationale for all \r\nopinions expressed.  The diagnosis should \r\nbe in accordance with DSM IV.  The entire \r\nclaims folder and a copy of this Remand \r\nmust be made available to and reviewed by \r\nthe examiner prior to the examination.\r\n\r\nThe results proffered by the examiner \r\nmust reference the complete claims \r\nfolders and any inconsistent past \r\ndiagnoses given.  Also, it is requested \r\nthat the results of the examination be \r\ntyped or otherwise recorded in a legible \r\nmanner for review purposes.\r\n\r\n7.  The RO should review the claims \r\nfolder and ensure that all of the \r\nforegoing development actions have been \r\nconducted and completed in full.  If any \r\ndevelopment is incomplete, appropriate \r\ncorrective action is to be implemented.  \r\nSpecific attention is directed to the \r\nreport of examination.  If the requested \r\nreport does not include fully detailed \r\ndescriptions of pathology and all test \r\nreports, special studies or adequate \r\nresponses to the specific opinions \r\nrequested, the report must be returned \r\nfor corrective action.  38 C.F.R. � 4.2 \r\n(2005); see also Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. \r\nApp. 268 (1998).\r\n\r\nThereafter, the RO should readjudicate the claims for service \r\nconnection for a psychiatric disorder.  If the benefits \r\nsought on appeal remain denied, the appellant and the \r\nappellant's representative should be provided a supplemental \r\nstatement of the case (SSOC).  The SSOC must contain notice \r\nof all relevant actions taken on the claim for benefits, to \r\ninclude a summary of the evidence and applicable law and \r\nregulations considered pertinent to the issue currently on \r\nappeal.  An appropriate period of time should be allowed for \r\nresponse.  Thereafter, the case should be returned to the \r\nBoard, if in order.  The Board intimates no opinion as to the \r\nultimate outcome of this case.  The appellant need take no \r\naction unless otherwise notified.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the examinations requested in this remand is \r\nto obtain information or evidence (or both), which may be \r\ndispositive of the appeal.  Therefore, the veteran is hereby \r\nplaced on notice that pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 3.655 (2005) \r\nfailure to cooperate by attending the requested VA \r\nexamination may result in an adverse determination.  See \r\nConnolly v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 566, 569 (1991).\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet.

The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate \r\n\r\n\r\naction must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Moore, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service in August 1979 to March 1980.\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the \r\nBoard) on appeal from a January 2003 rating decision of the \r\nCleveland, Ohio Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional \r\nOffice (RO).\r\n\r\nIn November 2005, the veteran testified at a personal hearing \r\nbefore the Board.  A transcript of that hearing has been \r\nassociated with the claims file.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify you if \r\nfurther action is required on your part.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran asserts that service connection is warranted for \r\nPTSD based on personal assault.  The claims folder \r\nestablishes that her claimed stressors include being sexually \r\nassaulted in November 1979, January 1980, and February 1980.  \r\nMedically, the record reflects that the veteran was \r\npsychiatrically normal on her August 1979 enlistment \r\nexamination and that she denied a history of depression or \r\nexcessive worry, frequent trouble sleeping, or nervous \r\ntrouble of any sort.  However, in a February 1980 report of \r\nexamination, the veteran reported a history of frequent \r\ntrouble sleeping, depression or excessive worry, nervous \r\ntrouble, periods of unconsciousness, and fear.  An examiner \r\nalso reported that the veteran was nervous. Additionally, the \r\nrecord reflects that in March 1980, the veteran went to the \r\nCommunicable Disease Clinic for gonorrhea.  Moreover, the \r\nrecord establishes that in March 1980, the veteran was \r\ndischarged due to unsuitability after she was diagnosed with \r\nschizoid personality, as manifested by shyness, \r\noversensitivity, seclusiveness, avoidance of close or \r\ncompetitive relationships, and often eccentricity.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the record reflects that the veteran has \r\nundergone outpatient treatment for recurrent depression since \r\n2001.  Further, although some VA outpatient examiners have \r\ndiagnosed the veteran with PTSD, one has indicated that she \r\ndid not meet the diagnostic requirement for it.   However, \r\nthe Board observes that the record does not demonstrate that \r\nany of these examiners reviewed the veteran's claims file \r\nprior to rendering their diagnosis.  \r\n\r\nAlso, the record does not demonstrate that the veteran has \r\nundergone VA examination.  The Board observes that she was \r\nscheduled for examination in July 2002 and failed to report.  \r\nHowever, in her January 2004 Notice of Disagreement, the \r\nveteran indicated that she did not receive notification of \r\nthe examination until after the fact.  According to the \r\nveteran, she contacted the RO to inform them of this and was \r\ntold that they would send a request to reschedule.  However, \r\nshe indicated that she did not receive notice of any such \r\nexamination.  Thus, as the veteran has not undergone a VA \r\nexamination to determine the nature and etiology of her \r\npyschiatric symptomology or a clinical opinion, the Board \r\nfinds a VA examination and clinical opinion is warranted.  \r\n\r\nThe Board observes that although the veteran's claimed \r\nstressors include the alleged occurrence of in-service \r\npersonal assaults, the RO developed the veteran's PTSD claim \r\nunder provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) and not under the \r\nprovisions 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) (2005)(for PTSD claims \r\nbased on in-service personal assaults). Therefore, the Board \r\nconcludes, that it must be determined whether the alleged \r\nassaults in service are verified by the record.  The Board \r\nalso notes that although the veteran was issued VCAA notice \r\nfor a PTSD claim in November 2001, the record does not \r\nreflect that she was provided notice at that time of the \r\nalternate sources of evidence that may be utilized for \r\nverification of personal assaults, as \r\ncontained in 38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (f)(3) (2005), as required by \r\nthe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-\r\n475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000).  In this regard, the Board notes \r\nthat a statement of the case issued in April 2004 contained \r\nthe provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (f)(3) which outline \r\nexamples of alternate sources of evidence that may be \r\nutilized for verification of personal assaults.  \r\nNevertheless, in light of the need to remand the appeal for \r\nthe additional reasons outlined herein, the veteran should be \r\nprovided a VCAA notice letter specific to the veteran's claim \r\nfor service connection for PTSD based on personal assaults.\r\n\r\nDuring her November 2005 hearing, the veteran reported that \r\nshe filed a report with the military police station at Ft. \r\nGordon after her November 1979 assault and that the \r\nindividual who allegedly assaulted her was brought in.  \r\nHowever, the veteran indicated that she had not obtained the \r\nreport.  Thus, the Board finds that an attempt should be made \r\nto locate such report.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstance, the Board finds that additional \r\ndevelopment is required.  As such, the case is REMANDED to \r\nthe RO for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO must ensure that all VCAA \r\nnotice obligations have been satisfied, \r\nspecifically as to a PTSD stressor \r\ndevelopment letter with notice of \r\nalternate sources of evidence for \r\nverification of personal assaults, as \r\ncontained in 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) \r\n(2005) and the VA ADJUDICATION PROCEDURE \r\nMANUAL M21-1, Part III, Par. 5.14d.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 5103, 5103A (West 2002); \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.159, see also Quartuccio v. \r\nPrincipi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002), \r\nPelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 \r\n(2005) (Pelegrini II); and any other \r\napplicable legal precedent.\r\n\r\n2.  The RO should attempt to locate the \r\nNovember 1979 military police report at \r\nFt. Gordon referenced by the veteran \r\nduring her November 2005 hearing.  If \r\nafter an exhaustive search, it is \r\ndetermined that the report is not \r\navailable, document this fact and note \r\nall attempts that were made to locate it.\r\n\r\n3.  The RO should contact the veteran \r\nand request that she furnish the names, \r\naddresses, and dates of treatment of all \r\nmedical providers from whom she has \r\nreceived treatment for her pyschiatric \r\ndisability, including PTSD since her \r\ndischarge from service.  After securing \r\nthe necessary authorizations for release \r\nof this information, the RO should seek \r\nto obtain copies of all treatment \r\nrecords referred to by the veteran, not \r\nalready of record.\r\n\r\n4. The veteran should then be afforded a \r\nVA examination by the appropriate \r\nspecialist to determine the nature and \r\netiology of any current psychiatric \r\ndisability, to include PTSD and/or \r\ndepression. \r\n\r\nThe examiner should be requested to \r\nfurnish an opinion as to whether it as at \r\nleast as likely as not (50 percent or \r\ngreater probability) that any current \r\nPTSD, if diagnosed, is etiologically \r\nrelated to her claimed stressors in \r\nservice.  In this regard, the examiner is \r\nrequested to furnish an opinion as to \r\nwhether any behavioral changes that \r\noccurred at or close in time to the \r\nalleged personal assaults indicate the \r\noccurrence of an alleged in-service \r\nstressor.\r\n\r\nThe examiner should be also requested to \r\nfurnish an opinion as to whether it is at \r\nleast as likely as not (50 percent or \r\ngreater probability) that any other \r\npsychiatric disorder that may be present, \r\nto include depression, is etiologically \r\nrelated to service. \r\n\r\nThe rationale for all opinions expressed \r\nshould be set forth.  All necessary tests \r\nshould be performed.  The claims folder \r\nshould be made available to the examiner \r\nfor review of pertinent documents therein \r\nin conjunction with the examination.  The \r\nexaminer should indicate whether the \r\nclaims file was reviewed.\r\n\r\n3.  Thereafter, the RO should review all \r\nof the evidence of record, including all \r\nnew evidence, and readjudicate the issue \r\nof entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD due to personal assault.  If the \r\ndetermination remains adverse to the \r\nveteran, a supplemental statement of the \r\ncase should be sent to her and her \r\nrepresentative.  She should be afforded \r\nan opportunity to respond to the \r\nsupplemental statement of the case.  \r\nThereafter, the case should be returned \r\nto the Board, as appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter the Board has remanded.

Dean, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant is not a veteran, and he has never served on \r\nactive duty.  He was a member of the U.S. Naval Reserves from \r\nApril 1967 to January 1969; and he apparently served on \r\nactive duty for training while attending the U.S. Naval \r\nSubmarine School at New London, Connecticut, from June 18 to \r\nAugust 25, 1967 (a two-week course from June 19-30, 1967, and \r\nthen an eight-week course from July 3 to August 25, 1967); \r\nand also while assigned to the U.S.S. SABLEFISH (SS303) from \r\nAugust 25 to September 8, 1967.  The service department has \r\nverified that the appellant \"had no active service or less \r\nthan 90 consecutive days of active duty for training.\"  See \r\nLetters from the National Personnel Records Center dated \r\nJanuary 25 and April 15, 2002, and addressed to the \r\nappellant.  As discussed below, it is necessary to verify the \r\nexact dates of the appellant's active duty for training.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) from a February 2003 rating determination by the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nMuskogee, Oklahoma.  In September 2005, the appellant \r\ntestified at the RO during a video conference held before the \r\nundersigned, who was in Washington, D.C.  A transcript of \r\nthat hearing is of record.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify you if \r\nfurther action is required on your part.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn March 1968, the appellant was hospitalized at a \r\nMetropolitan State Hospital with a diagnosis of a \r\nschizophrenic reaction, chronic undifferentiated type.  \r\nVerification of the exact dates of active duty for training \r\nis needed in this appeal in order to determine whether or not \r\nthe presumptive provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. � 1112(a) are \r\napplicable.  Subsequent postservice psychiatric treatments at \r\nBellevue Hospital in New York City, at Manhattan State \r\nHospital, and at Northeastern Florida State Hospital in \r\nRockledge, Florida, are not documented in the current record.  \r\nThese medical records are directly relevant to the present \r\nappeal.  \r\n\r\nSocial Security benefits were granted to the appellant in \r\nJuly 1995 based upon psychiatric diagnoses of a bipolar \r\ndisorder, polysubstance abuse (alcohol, amphetamines, \r\ncocaine, heroin), and a depersonalization disorder.  A \r\ndiagnosis of a drug-induced delusional disorder is also \r\nreflected by the medical evidence of record, and the \r\nappellant's current private psychiatrist has reported \r\ndiagnoses of a schizoaffective disorder and PTSD.  Finally, \r\nan official VA psychiatric examination of the appellant in \r\nOctober 2002 (conducted without a review of most of the \r\nrelevant medical records) resulted in a diagnosis of \r\nschizophrenia, undifferentiated type.  There appears to be a \r\nsubstantial question remaining in this appeal as to what is \r\nthe appellant's correct current psychiatric diagnosis.  \r\nFurther clarification of this matter is needed.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe appellant contends that he currently has PTSD as a result \r\nof repeated physical attacks on him while he was attending \r\nSubmarine School.  He has described episodes of hazing by his \r\nclassmates which he alleges occurred every night for three \r\nweeks and were witnessed by most of the individuals in his \r\nbarracks.  The appellant admits that he never reported these \r\nincidents nor did he seek medical treatment for his injuries \r\nat the time.  In addition, he has not been able to provide \r\nany corroborating information, including specific information \r\nto enable the service department or the RO to verify that \r\nthese attacks actually took place as he has described.  For \r\nexample, repeated attempts to obtain a class roster have been \r\nunsuccessful.  Although the appellant and his representative \r\nhave requested that VA assist them in verifying these claimed \r\nstressor events in service, they have pointed to no concrete \r\naction which VA could take in this regard.  However, the \r\nappellant has not been advised of the provisions of 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f)(3) pertaining to the type of evidence needed to \r\nsupport a PTSD claim based upon allegations of personal \r\nassault.  Further appellate review of this claim would not be \r\nappropriate until this violation of the appellant's due \r\nprocess rights can be corrected.  \r\n\r\nThe Board would also comment that a review of the appellant's \r\nmedical records reveals that he has often reported similar \r\nunverified incidents throughout his life.  For example, the \r\nappellant reported to private mental health providers in \r\nApril 1995 that he had suffered frequent physical abuse from \r\nhis father and neighborhood children during his childhood.  \r\nSimilarly, in July 1995, the appellant told a private \r\npsychiatrist who examined him for the Social Security \r\nAdministration that he had been beaten up by five men and \r\nleft in a dumpster in June 1994.  These medical records also \r\nreveal that the appellant reportedly had attempted suicide on \r\nseveral occasions prior to his enlistment in the Reserves.  \r\nIt is significant, therefore, that the VA examiner in October \r\n2002 stated as his opinion that the appellant's schizophrenic \r\ncondition was exacerbated by his military service.  \r\nUnfortunately, this opinion was based solely upon the \r\nappellant's uncorroborated verbal history rather than upon a \r\nreview of the relevant medical records, and it was also \r\napparently formed without any knowledge of the fact that the \r\nappellant had no active service.  A current VA psychiatric \r\nexamination of the appellant addressing all of the \r\noutstanding medical questions presented by this appeal would \r\nbe most helpful to the Board in its appellate consideration \r\nof this claim.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, this appeal is remanded to the RO (via the AMC) \r\nin Washington, D.C. for the following further actions:  \r\n\r\n1.  The AMC or the RO should request the \r\nservice department to verify the exact \r\ndates of any active duty for training by \r\nthe appellant during 1967 in order to \r\ndetermine if he had 90 or more days of \r\nactive, continuous service at that time \r\nwithin the meaning of 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.307(a)(1).  Written verification of \r\nthe actual dates of the appellant's \r\nactive duty for training in 1967 should \r\nbe obtained from the service department \r\nand incorporated into the claims file.  \r\n\r\n2.  The AMC or the RO should also issue a \r\nletter to the appellant providing him \r\nwith the notice required under 38 U.S.C. \r\n� 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) \r\npertaining to the current claim, to \r\ninclude notice that the appellant should \r\nsubmit any pertinent evidence in his \r\npossession.  The appellant should also \r\nspecifically be requested to provide \r\ncopies of his postservice psychiatric \r\ntreatment records at Bellevue Hospital in \r\nNew York City, at Manhattan State \r\nHospital, and at Northeastern Florida \r\nState Hospital in Rockledge, Florida.  At \r\nthe same time, the AMC or the RO should \r\nnotify the appellant of the provisions of \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) pertaining to the \r\ntype of evidence needed to support a PTSD \r\nclaim based upon allegations of personal \r\nassault.  \r\n\r\n3.  The AMC or the RO should take \r\nappropriate steps to obtain a copy of any \r\npertinent evidence identified but not \r\nprovided by the appellant, including the \r\npostservice medical records set forth \r\nabove.  \r\n\r\n4.  If the AMC or the RO is unable to \r\nobtain a copy of any pertinent evidence \r\nidentified by the appellant, it should so \r\ninform the appellant and his \r\nrepresentative and request them to \r\nprovide a copy of the outstanding \r\nevidence.  \r\n\r\n5.  Then, the appellant should be \r\nscheduled for a VA psychiatric \r\nexamination (preferably by a \r\npsychiatrist) to determine the current \r\npsychiatric diagnosis(es) and its(their) \r\nrelationship, if any, to the appellant's \r\nnon-active-duty service.  Any indicated \r\nstudies must be performed, and the claims \r\nfile, including a copy of this remand, \r\nmust be made available to and pertinent \r\ndocuments therein reviewed by the \r\nexaminer.  The examination report should \r\nreflect that the claims file was \r\nreviewed.  The AMC or the RO should also \r\ninform the examiner of the identity of \r\nany and all in-service stressor events \r\nwhich are considered to be verified by \r\nthe available evidence.  Based upon the \r\ninterview with the appellant and \r\nespecially upon a review of the relevant \r\nhistorical material in the claims file, \r\nthe VA psychiatric examiner should \r\ndetermine the correct current psychiatric \r\ndiagnosis(es); for each such current \r\npsychiatric diagnosis, the examiner \r\nshould also state whether or not that \r\ndisorder is etiologically related to \r\nservice (and if PTSD is diagnosed, \r\nwhether it is etiologically related to \r\nany verified event occurring in service) \r\nor was permanently worsened by any such \r\nverified in-service event.  The rationale \r\nfor all opinions expressed should also be \r\nprovided.  \r\n\r\n6.  After all appropriate development has \r\nbeen completed, the AMC or the RO should \r\nreadjudicate the current claim on a de \r\nnovo basis without reference to prior \r\nadjudications.  As part of this action, \r\nthe AMC or the RO should determine \r\nwhether or not presumptive service \r\nconnection pursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 1112(a) and 38 C.F.R. �� 3.307 and \r\n3.309 is warranted, fully stating the \r\nreasons and bases for this and all of its \r\ndeterminations with respect to the \r\npresent claim.  \r\n\r\nIf any benefits sought on appeal are not granted to the \r\nappellant's satisfaction, the appellant and his \r\nrepresentative should be furnished an appropriate \r\nsupplemental statement of the case and provided the requisite \r\nopportunity to respond.  In accordance with proper appellate \r\nprocedures, the case should then be returned to the Board for \r\nfurther appellate consideration.  The appellant need take no \r\nfurther action until he is otherwise informed, but he may \r\nfurnish additional evidence and argument on the remanded \r\nmatter while the case is in remand status.  See \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).  \r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2005).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nBARBARA B.

Boominathan, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active military service from February 1967 to \r\nMarch 1969. \r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\nfrom a September 2002 rating decision of the Department of \r\nVeterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Boise, Idaho, \r\nwhich denied service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify you if \r\nfurther action is required on your part.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran claims entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD.  In support of his claim, he has cited a number of \r\nstressors related to his Vietnam service.  His service \r\npersonnel records show that he was in Vietnam from December \r\n1967 to February 1969 and that during this period of time, he \r\nserved with the 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry, and 11th \r\nInfantry Brigade as a radio operator. \r\n\r\nThe veteran has submitted several personal written statements \r\nand testifies that he was under constant attack by rockets \r\nand mortar at Fire Support Bases (FSB) and at LZ Dottie, \r\nThunder and Carentan.  The file includes a photograph of the \r\nveteran taken in June 1968 at LZ Thunder.\r\n \r\nA review of the claims files shows that the RO has made \r\nseveral attempts to verify the veteran's reports of in-\r\nservice stressors.  The USASCRUR November 2004 report noted \r\nthat LZ Carentan was attacked several times from January to \r\nMarch 1968.  Despite the RO's request, the report did not \r\nverify if the veteran was at LZ Carentan.  There is no \r\ninformation of attacks on LZ Thunder in June 1968. \r\n\r\nThe veteran has been examined at a Veteran's Center and has \r\nhad two VA examinations.  The most recent VA examination, in \r\nNovember 2003, reported that the veteran had symptoms of PTSD \r\nbut not enough to qualify for a diagnosis of PTSD.  In April \r\n2002, the same examiner diagnosed the veteran with PTSD.      \r\n\r\nIn order to ensure that VA has met its duty to assist the \r\nveteran in developing the facts pertinent to the claim and to \r\nensure full compliance with due process requirements, the \r\ncase is REMANDED to the AMC for the following development:\r\n\r\n1. The AMC should request that the National Archives and \r\nrequest a unit history and/or lessons learned for the \r\nunits the veteran was assigned to in Vietnam from \r\nDecember 1967 to March 1969.including the HHC, 1st \r\nBattalion, 20th Infantry at LZ Thunder from May 1968 to \r\nJuly 1968. \r\n\r\n2. After receipt and review of #1, if the RO determines \r\nthat there is a credible inservice stressor, then \r\nveteran should be scheduled for another VA psychiatric \r\nexamination to ascertain the nature, extent, and \r\netiology of his PTSD.  It is imperative that the claims \r\nfile be made available to and reviewed by the examiner \r\nin connection with the examination.  The examiner is \r\nasked to determine whether the veteran has PTSD and \r\nwhether his PTSD is at least as likely as not related to \r\nhis inservice stressor.  Detailed reasons and bases for \r\nall diagnoses and opinions should be provided including \r\na discussion of evidence relied on for opinion.\r\n\r\n3. After undertaking any other development deemed \r\nessential, in addition to that specified above, the AMC \r\nshould re-adjudicate the veteran's claim.  If any \r\nbenefit sought on appeal remains denied, the veteran \r\nshould be provided a Supplemental Statement of the Case \r\n(SSOC).  The SSOC must notify the veteran of all \r\nrelevant actions taken on his claim for benefits, and \r\nsummarize the evidence and discussion of all pertinent \r\nregulations.  An appropriate period of time should be \r\nallowed for response.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.

Jivens-McRae, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from January 1982 to \r\nApril 1987.  It also appears from the record that the veteran \r\nhas unverified duty with the Washington Air National Guard.  \r\n\r\nThis appeal arises from a July 2002 rating decision of the \r\nSeattle, Washington, Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) \r\nRegional Office (RO), which denied service connection for an \r\nacquired psychiatric disorder, to include major depression, \r\nanxiety disorder, schizophrenia, and PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran testified at a Travel Board hearing before the \r\nundersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) in October 2004.  A copy \r\nof the hearing transcript is of record and associated with \r\nthe claims folder.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran is unrepresented in this claim.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify you if \r\nfurther action is required on your part.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends, in essence, that service connection is \r\nwarranted for an acquired psychiatric disorder, variously \r\ndescribed, based upon service incurrence.  He maintains that \r\nhe began having hallucinations three months after service \r\nentrance and that he was encouraged to not pursue psychiatric \r\nhelp for fear of being sent home.  He claimed that his \r\npsychosis worsened, and in approximately January 1983, while \r\nstationed at Eglin Air Force Base, he was hospitalized for \r\nhis psychiatric condition.  He stated that while stationed in \r\nLakenheath, England, he attempted to leave service at one \r\npoint as a contentious objector, and after speaking with a \r\nCatholic priest, he was discouraged from pursuing this route.  \r\nAdditionally, he maintains that he was told to destroy his \r\nmedical records after seeing a medical examiner for his \r\npsychiatric condition, so that he would not lose his top \r\nsecret clearance.  \r\n\r\nA review of the record reveals that the veteran's service \r\nmedical records were sought in connection with this claim.  \r\nAlthough there are limited service medical records associated \r\nwith the file, there are no records indicating the veteran's \r\nhospitalization in service in connection with a psychiatric \r\ndisorder.  The National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) \r\nshould be contacted and a search for additional service \r\nmedical records and inpatient psychiatric clinicals should be \r\nmade.  The veteran's service personnel records should also be \r\nsought, and if located, associated with the claims folder.  \r\n\r\nThe record also indicates that the veteran's service medical \r\nrecords were lost while in the Air National Guard during Tech \r\ntraining.  Verification of the veteran's Air National Guard \r\nservice has not been done.  Additionally, there is no \r\nindication in the record that an attempt has been made to \r\nobtain the veteran's Air National Guard service medical \r\nrecords.  Both verification of his National Guard service and \r\nan attempt to obtain any service medical records associated \r\nwith that service should be done prior to resolution of the \r\nclaim.  Further, the veteran should be informed of \r\nalternative sources he is able to present in an effort to \r\nsubstantiate his claim.  \r\n\r\nFinally, during the pendency of this appeal, on \r\nMarch 3, 2006, the Court issued a decision in the \r\nconsolidated appeal of Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, Nos. 01-\r\n1917 and 02-1506, which held that the VCAA notice \r\nrequirements of 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.159(b) apply to all five elements of a service connection \r\nclaim.  Additionally, this notice must include notice that a \r\ndisability rating and an effective date for the award of \r\nbenefits will be assigned if service connection is awarded.  \r\nId.  In the present appeal, the veteran was provided with \r\nnotice of what type of information and evidence was needed to \r\nsubstantiate his claim for service connection, but he was not \r\nprovided with notice of the type of evidence necessary to \r\nestablish a disability rating or effective date for the \r\ndisability on appeal.  \r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, additional development is necessary \r\nprior to final disposition of this claim.  Accordingly, this \r\nmatter is REMANDED for the following:\r\n\r\n1.  The National Personnel Records Center \r\nshould be contacted and requested to \r\nprovide the veteran's service medical \r\nrecords, specifically inpatient clinical \r\nrecords for hospitalization at Eglin Air \r\nForce Base in Florida, around \r\nJanuary 1983, and associate those records \r\nwith the claims folder.  The veteran's \r\nservice personnel records should also be \r\nobtained and associated with the claims \r\nfolder.  If no service records can be \r\nfound, or if they have been destroyed, \r\nask for specific confirmation of that \r\nfact.\r\n\r\n2.  The record suggests that the veteran \r\nhad a period of Air National Guard duty.  \r\nContact the veteran and request that he \r\nidentify his dates of service in the \r\nWashington Air National Guard.  The \r\nveteran should also identify the name and \r\naddress of the National Guard unit he was \r\nattached to.  Upon receipt of the \r\nrequested information, contact the \r\nNational Personnel Records Center (NPRC), \r\nthe state, or any other appropriate \r\nagency, verify his service and obtain all \r\nservice personnel records and service \r\nmedical records related to the veteran's \r\nservice in the Air National Guard.  If no \r\nservice records can be found, or if they \r\nhave been destroyed, ask for specific \r\nconfirmation of that fact.\r\n\r\n3.  The RO should advise the veteran that \r\nhe may provide alternative types of \r\nevidence to show that a psychiatric \r\ndisability was present proximate to \r\nservice, including statements from former \r\nemployers, supervisors, co-workers, or \r\nacquaintances, or written opinions from \r\nprivate physicians or health care \r\nproviders, and the like.  \r\n\r\n4.  Send the veteran a corrective VCAA \r\nnotice under 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) and \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b), that includes an \r\nexplanation as to the information or \r\nevidence needed to establish a disability \r\nrating and an effective date for the \r\nclaim on appeal, as outlined by the Court \r\nin Dingess/Hartmann v. Nicholson, Nos. \r\n01-1917 and 02-1506 (U.S. Vet. App. \r\nMar. 3, 2006).  \r\n\r\n5.  Readjudicate the claim for service \r\nconnection for an acquired psychiatric \r\ndisorder, to include major depression, \r\nanxiety disorder, schizophrenia, and \r\nPTSD.  If the benefit sought on appeal \r\nremains denied, the veteran should be \r\nprovided a Supplemental Statement of the \r\nCase.  The requisite period of time \r\nshould be allowed for response.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v.

Friedman, Attorney\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nMilo H. Hawley, Senior Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from May 1969 to September \r\n1970.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from an August 2000 decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nSeattle, Washington.\r\n\r\nThe veteran appealed a September 2003 Board decision, denying \r\nservice connection for PTSD, to the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In an October 2005 \r\norder the Court vacated and remanded the Board's decision.  A \r\ncopy of the Court's order has been included in the claims \r\nfile.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify you if \r\nfurther action is required on your part.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIt is the veteran's primary assertion that a 25 day period of \r\nabsence without leave (AWOL), from January 10, 1970, to \r\nFebruary 3, 1970, and frequent trouble sleeping, as reported \r\nby the veteran on his Report of Medical History completed in \r\nconjunction with his service separation examination in \r\nSeptember 1970, were the result of personal assaults the \r\nveteran experienced during his active service.  It does not \r\nappear that an attempt has been made to refer the veteran's \r\nclaims file to the appropriate healthcare professional in \r\norder to determine if there is evidence of behavior changes \r\nthat might indicate the occurrence of an in-service stressor.  \r\nThe Court has held that the provisions in M21-1, Part III, \r\n5.14(c), on which the provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) \r\nare based, that address PTSD claims based on personal assault \r\nare substantive rules which are the equivalent of VA \r\nregulations.  YR v. West, 11 Vet. App. 393, 398-99 (1998); \r\nPatton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272 (1999).  See VA Adjudication \r\nManual M21-1 (M21-1), Part III, 5.14(c) (February 20, 1996) \r\n(recently converted to M21-1 MR, IV.ii.1.D.14).  \r\n\r\nThe Court has recently provided additional guidance regarding \r\nnotice that is required by the Veterans Claims Assistance Act \r\nof 2000 (VCAA), 38 U.S.C.A. � 5100 et seq. (West 2000 & Supp. \r\n2005).  See Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, Nos. 01-1917 & 02-\r\n1506 (March 3, 2006).  VA has not yet had an opportunity to \r\nprovide the veteran VCAA notice in accordance with Dingess.  \r\nA review of the record reveals that the veteran underwent \r\nbasic training from May 20, 1969, to July 18, 1969, and \r\nAdvance Individual Training (AIT) from August 4, 1969, to \r\nNovember 7, 1969.  He was promoted from E-1 to E-2 on August \r\n19, 1969.  He undertook airborne training in November 1969 \r\nand was permanently disqualified from this endeavor on \r\nDecember 3, 1969.  The veteran has reported, in a June 2000 \r\nstatement, that he received orders for Vietnam on December \r\n22, 1969.  He was AWOL for 25 days from January 10, 1970, to \r\nFebruary 3, 1970, and reduced to E-1 February 5, 1970.  He \r\nwas in Vietnam from February 7, 1970, to June 3, 1970, and \r\nwas promoted to E-2 on April 1, 1970, and to E-3 on April 2, \r\n1970.  \r\n\r\nA June 1997 letter/statement of Bruce Harmon, a private \r\nWashington State Mental Health Counselor, reflects that the \r\nveteran reported that he abruptly ended his tour in Vietnam \r\ndue to returning to the United States on hardship leave to \r\nattend the funeral of his father who was killed in an \r\nautomobile accident.  Mr. Harmon continues that the veteran \r\nsubsequently received a hardship discharge.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran reported on his Report of Medical History, in \r\nconjunction with his separation examination of September \r\n1970, that he had frequent trouble sleeping.  In a statement, \r\ndated in June 2000, the veteran indicates that he did not \r\nexperience personal assault during AIT or airborne training \r\nbecause he hid himself so well they hardly knew he was there.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran's personnel records have been requested and a \r\nresponse received, which includes some records, but records \r\nrelating to his period of AWOL, Article 15s (2 Article 15s as \r\nshown to have been reported by the veteran in a November 1992 \r\nVA treatment record and 1 Article 15 as shown to have been \r\nreported by the veteran in a December 1995 VA examination), \r\nand records relating to his Airborne training have not been \r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nVA treatment records from the Seattle VA Medical Center (MC) \r\nhave been received through November 1996, but not thereafter.  \r\nLetters/statements have been received from Bruce Harmon, a \r\nprivate Washington State Mental Health Counselor, but it does \r\nnot appear that treatment records have been received from Mr. \r\nHarmon.\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, the appeal is REMANDED for the \r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n1.  Provide the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative with notice of the VCAA in \r\naccordance with Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 \r\nVet. App. 112 (2004) and Dingess.\r\n\r\n2.  Request copies of records from the \r\nSeattle VAMC relating to any psychiatric \r\ntreatment of the veteran from November \r\n1996 to the present.\r\n\r\n3.  Request copies of records from Bruce \r\nHarmon, a private Washington State Mental \r\nHealth Counselor, relating to any \r\npsychiatric treatment he has provided the \r\nveteran.\r\n\r\n4.  Request all of the veteran's service \r\npersonnel records based on personal \r\ntrauma (\"PIES request code 018,\" M21-1 \r\nMR, IV.ii.1.D.14), including specifically \r\nrelating to any Article 15s, AWOL from \r\nJanuary 10, 1970, to February 3, 1970, \r\nand \"JUMPS\" records relating to \r\nairborne training in November and \r\nDecember 1969.\r\n\r\n5.  The RO should again readjudicate the \r\nveteran's claim for entitlement to \r\nservice connection for PTSD, with \r\napplication of all appropriate laws and \r\nregulations and consideration of any \r\nadditional information obtained.  If the \r\nbenefit sought on appeal remains denied, \r\nthe veteran and his representative should \r\nbe provided with a supplemental statement \r\nof the case and afforded the appropriate \r\nopportunity to respond thereto.  \r\n\r\nThereafter, the case should be returned to the Board, if in \r\norder.  The Board intimates no opinion as to the ultimate \r\noutcome of this case.  The veteran need take no action unless \r\notherwise notified.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.

J. O'Mara, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active military service from February 1966 to \r\nFebruary 1968.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) from a June 2003 rating decision by the Pittsburgh, \r\nPennsylvania Regional Office (RO) of the Department of \r\nVeterans Affairs (VA), which denied the veteran service \r\nconnection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe veteran was scheduled for a Board hearing in April 2006.  \r\nHe failed to report to the hearing and has not requested that \r\nthe hearing be rescheduled.  Therefore, the Board finds that \r\nthe veteran's Board hearing request has been withdrawn.\r\n\r\nIn January 2005, the Board remanded the veteran's case to the \r\nRO for further development.  The case was returned to the \r\nBoard in March 2006.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  All pertinent notification and indicated development have \r\nbeen completed.\r\n\r\n2.  The veteran's current psychiatric disorder is not \r\netiologically related to service.\r\n\r\n3.  The evidence of record does not show that the veteran \r\nsuffers from PTSD related to a confirmed in-service stressor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nAn acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, was \r\nneither incurred in or aggravated by active duty, nor can it \r\nbe so presumed.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1110, 5103, 5103A (West \r\n2002 & Supp. 2005); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2005).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) is \r\napplicable to this appeal.  To implement the provisions of \r\nthe law, the VA promulgated regulations codified at 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a)).  The Act and \r\nimplementing regulations provide that VA will assist a \r\nclaimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate a \r\nclaim but is not required to provide assistance to a claimant \r\nif there is no reasonable possibility that such assistance \r\nwould aid in substantiating the claim.  It also includes new \r\nnotification provisions. \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that a substantially complete claim was \r\nreceived in December 2002, after the enactment of the VCAA.  \r\n\r\nAn RO letter dated in December 2002, before the original \r\nadjudication of the claim, provided the veteran the notice \r\nrequired under the VCAA and the implementing regulations.  In \r\nthis letter, VA notified the veteran of his responsibility to \r\nsubmit evidence that showed that his condition was related to \r\nservice.  By this letter, the veteran was notified of what \r\nevidence, if any, was necessary to substantiate his claim and \r\nit indicated which portion of that evidence the veteran was \r\nresponsible for sending to VA and which portion of that \r\nevidence VA would attempt to obtain on behalf of the veteran.  \r\nClearly, from submissions by and on behalf of the veteran, he \r\nis fully conversant with the legal requirements in this case.  \r\nThus, the content of this letter complied with the \r\nrequirements of 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.159(b).\r\n\r\nDuring the pendency of this appeal, on March 3, 2006, the \r\nUnited States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) \r\nissued a decision in the consolidated appeal of \r\nDingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006), which \r\ndiscussed the VCAA notice requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b).  As stated above, full \r\ncompliance with VCAA has been accomplished regarding the \r\nissue of service connection.  Because this claim is being \r\ndenied, any other notice requirements beyond those cited for \r\nservice connection claims, are not applicable, as this denial \r\nrenders any rating issue or effective date issue moot.  \r\nTherefore, as there has been substantial compliance with all \r\npertinent VA law and regulations, to move forward with \r\nadjudication of this claim would not cause any prejudice to \r\nthe veteran.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 394 \r\n(1993) (where the Board addresses a question that has not \r\nbeen addressed by the agency of original jurisdiction, the \r\nBoard must consider whether the veteran has been prejudiced \r\nthereby).\r\n\r\nIn the Board's opinion, the RO has properly processed the \r\nappeal following the issuance of the required notice.  \r\nMoreover, all pertinent, available evidence has been obtained \r\nin this case.  The veteran has not identified any additional \r\nevidence that could be obtained to substantiate the claim.  \r\nTherefore, the Board is satisfied that VA has complied with \r\nthe duty to assist requirements of the VCAA and the \r\nimplementing regulations.  Accordingly, the Board will \r\naddress the merits of this claim.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nThe veteran and his representative contend, in substance, \r\nthat the veteran suffers from PTSD as a result of his \r\nservice.  Applicable law provides that service connection \r\nwill be granted if it is shown a particular disease or injury \r\nresulting in disability was incurred or aggravated during \r\nactive duty.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 2002).\r\n\r\nA \"determination of service connection requires a finding of \r\nthe existence of a current disability and a determination of \r\na relationship between that disability and an injury or \r\ndisease incurred in service.\"  Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. \r\n309, 314 (1993).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � \r\n4.125(a), and a link, established by medical evidence, \r\nbetween current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and \r\ncredible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service \r\nstressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2005).\r\n\r\nIf the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to \r\nthat combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence \r\nto the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is \r\nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone \r\nmay establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service \r\nstressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2005).\r\n\r\nIf the claimed stressor is unrelated to combat, a veteran's \r\nlay testimony regarding the in-service stressor is \r\ninsufficient to establish the occurrence of the stressor and \r\nmust be corroborated by \"credible supporting evidence.\"  See \r\nCohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 142 (1997).\r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative \r\nevidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the \r\ndetermination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in \r\nresolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 5107(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102 (2005).\r\n\r\nAfter review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that \r\nservice connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to \r\ninclude PTSD is not warranted.  As such, the Board notes that \r\nthe veteran received psychiatric treatment in service.  In \r\nFebruary 1967 he became hysterical after receiving a letter \r\nfrom his wife and that he \"locked and loaded his weapon as \r\nif to commit suicide.  It was noted that he had exhibited \r\nemotional instability in the past, although the veteran \r\ndenied this.  The diagnosis was depressive reaction.  In May \r\n1967, he underwent a psychiatric consultation and exhibited \r\nsymptoms of anxiousness, flat affect, with a history of acute \r\ndepression precipitated by family problems.  Therapy was \r\nrecommended.  Upon separation, no psychiatric disability was \r\nnoted on the separation examination.  Further, the veteran's \r\nservice personnel records show that he was in Vietnam from \r\nSeptember 1966 to May 1967, one of his military occupational \r\nspecialties was wireman and he received no medals or awards \r\nindicative of combat exposure.\r\n\r\nThe veteran asserts that he suffers from PTSD related to his \r\nservice.  His reported stressor is that while in service, his \r\nwife wrote him a letter stating that she was leaving him, \r\nwhich caused him to be depressed and to attempt suicide.  \r\nUpon his return from service, he stated that he drank heavily \r\nand had a bad temper.  Three lay statements from the \r\nveteran's children, received by the RO in December 2002, \r\ndescribe the veteran upon his return from service as having a \r\ntemper and being a different person before he went to the \r\nservice.\r\n\r\nA February 2002 medical record from a private physician, \r\nS.P., M.D., shows a reported diagnosis by the veteran of \r\nquestionable PTSD from Vietnam.  A November 2002 letter from \r\nthe same private physician, S.P., M.D., noted a diagnosis of \r\nclinical depression and anxiety.  \r\n\r\nIn March 2003, the veteran underwent a VA psychiatric \r\nexamination, wherein he reported his experience in the \r\nservice and the combat that he experienced.  He did not \r\ndescribe combat as being difficult or frequent, but did \r\nreport that there were frequent rocket and mortar attacks at \r\nthe base that were quite dangerous.  When asked about his \r\ncurrent difficulties that were related to wartime \r\nexperiences, the veteran responded that he had generic \r\nclinical depression.  He did not relate these symptoms to \r\nwartime experiences, but to a letter received by the veteran \r\nfrom his wife during service, which after reading, he \r\nattempted suicide.  The veteran also reported no history of \r\npsychiatric treatment.  After physical examination and review \r\nof the claims folder, the physician diagnosed the veteran \r\nwith dysthymic disorder, secondary to multiple life \r\nstressors, unrelated to military service and noted that the \r\nveteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for the \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD either in terms of identified stressors or \r\nin terms of symptom presentation.\r\n\r\nAs a diagnosis of PTSD is required for a grant of service \r\nconnection for PTSD, and the veteran does not have a current \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD, nor does his stressor meet the criteria \r\nfor criterion A of a PTSD diagnosis, the Board finds that \r\nservice connection is not warranted for the veteran's PTSD.  \r\nIn addition, as the March 2003 VA physician opined that the \r\nveteran's dysthymic disorder is not related to his military \r\nservice but rather to multiple life stressors, the Board \r\nfinds that service connection for an acquired psychiatric \r\ndisorder is also not warranted.  Moreover, the first \r\ndiagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disorder in the record \r\nwas in December 2002.  As this is more than one year after \r\nthe veteran's discharge from service, service connection for \r\nthe veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder may not be \r\npresumed.  38 C.F.R. � 3.307 (2005).  Further, although the \r\nveteran's children submitted lay statements to describe the \r\nveteran's personality after his return from service, as \r\nlaymen, they do not have the necessary medical training or \r\nexpertise to determine the cause of a medical condition or to \r\nmake a medical diagnosis.  See Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. \r\nApp. 492, 494- 95 (1992).  Therefore, as the medical evidence \r\nsupports a finding that the veteran's current psychiatric \r\ndisability is not related to his service, the Board finds \r\nthat the preponderance of the evidence is against the \r\nveteran's claim.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric \r\ndisorder, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is \r\ndenied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nREN�E M.

Sorisio, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from April 1965 until May \r\n1970.    \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA \r\nor Board) from a December 2002 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO) in \r\nNo. Little Rock, Arkansas.  The December 2002 decision was a \r\nreconsideration of the same service connection claim that had \r\npreviously been denied in September 2000 as not well-\r\ngrounded.  See Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), \r\nPub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096, 2099, �7(b); VAOPGCPREC \r\n3-2001 (Jan. 22, 2001) (providing for reconsideration of \r\nclaims, such as this one, that became final between July 14, \r\n1999 and November 9, 2000, the date of the enactment of the \r\nVCAA, and were denied on the basis that they were not well-\r\ngrounded).\r\n\r\nIt is observed that, in a July 2003 substantive appeal, the \r\nveteran indicated a desire for a hearing before a Veterans \r\nLaw Judge sitting at the RO.  However, a VA form 119, report \r\nof contact, indicates that the veteran's spouse requested a \r\npostponement of the hearing and asked for it to be \r\nrescheduled.  Another hearing was rescheduled for January \r\n2006, but again the veteran's spouse requested that the \r\nhearing be postponed and rescheduled.  The RO scheduled a \r\nTravel Board hearing for July 2006 and provided notice of \r\nsuch hearing in a correspondence date in April 2006.  \r\nHowever, the documentation of record indicates that the \r\nveteran failed to report.  There is no indication that the \r\nveteran requested to have this hearing rescheduled.  Further, \r\nthe veteran's representative, in a September 2006 written \r\nbrief presentation, did not request a hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The evidence does not establish that the veteran \r\nparticipated in combat with the enemy.\r\n\r\n2.  The veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD; however, the \r\nveteran's in-service stressor has not been verified by \r\nobjective evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� \r\n3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304 (2006).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) describes \r\nVA's duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a \r\nclaim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, \r\n5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2005); 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, and 3.326(a) (2006).  \r\n\r\nDuty to Notify\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete \r\napplication for benefits, VA is required to notify the \r\nclaimant and his or her representative, if any, of any \r\ninformation, and any medical or lay evidence, that is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) \r\n(West 2002 & Supp. 2005); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) (2005); \r\nQuartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  Proper VCAA \r\nnotice must inform the claimant of any information and \r\nevidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate \r\nthe claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; (3) that the \r\nclaimant is expected to provide; and (4) must ask the \r\nclaimant to provide any evidence in her or his possession \r\nthat pertains to the claim in accordance with 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.159(b)(1).  VCAA notice should be provided to a claimant \r\nbefore the initial unfavorable agency of original \r\njurisdiction (AOJ) decision on a claim.  Pelegrini v. \r\nPrincipi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004); see also Mayfield v. \r\nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 103 (2005), rev'd on other grounds, \r\n444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006).\r\n\r\nOn March 3, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for \r\nVeterans Claims (Court) issued its decision in the \r\nconsolidated appeal of Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. \r\nApp. 473 (2006).  The Court in Dingess/Hartman held that the \r\nVCAA notice requirements of 38 U.S.C. � 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.159(b) apply to all five elements of a \"service \r\nconnection\" claim.  As previously defined by the courts, \r\nthose five elements include:  (1) veteran status; (2) \r\nexistence of a disability; (3) a connection between the \r\nveteran's service and the disability; (4) degree of \r\ndisability; and (5) effective date of the disability.  Upon \r\nreceipt of an application for \"service connection,\" \r\ntherefore, VA is required to review the information and the \r\nevidence presented with the claim and to provide the claimant \r\nwith notice of what information and evidence not previously \r\nprovided, if any, will assist in substantiating or is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the elements of the claim as \r\nreasonably contemplated by the application.  This includes \r\nnotice that a disability rating and an effective date for the \r\naward of benefits will be assigned if service connection is \r\nawarded.\r\n\r\nVA satisfied its duty to notify as to the claim by means of \r\nJune 2004 and March 2006 letters from the RO to the \r\nappellant.  These letters informed him of what evidence was \r\nrequired to substantiate the claim and of his and VA's \r\nrespective duties for obtaining evidence.  The veteran was \r\nalso asked to submit pertinent evidence and/or information in \r\nhis possession to the AOJ.  Additionally, the March 2006 \r\nletter informed the veteran as to the law pertaining to the \r\nassignment of a disability rating and effective date as the \r\nCourt required in Dingess/Hartman.\r\n\r\nIn Pelegrini v. Principi, 14 Vet. App. 412 (2004), the Court \r\nheld that compliance with 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103 required that \r\nVCAA notice be provided prior to an initial unfavorable \r\nagency of original jurisdiction decision.  Because the VCAA \r\nnotice in this case was not completed prior to the initial \r\nAOJ adjudication denying the claim, the timing of the notice \r\ndoes not comply with the express requirements of the law as \r\nfound by the Court in Pelegrini.  Here, the Board finds that \r\nany defect with respect to the timing of the VCAA notice was \r\nharmless error.  Although the notice was provided to the \r\nappellant after the initial adjudication, the claim was \r\nreadjudicated thereafter, and the appellant has not been \r\nprejudiced thereby.  The content of the notice provided to \r\nthe appellant fully complied with the requirements of \r\n38 U.S.C. � 5103(a), 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b), and \r\nDingess/Hartman.  The veteran has been provided with every \r\nopportunity to submit evidence and argument in support of his \r\nclaim, and to respond to VA notices.  Therefore, not \r\nwithstanding Pelegrini, to decide the appeal would not be \r\nprejudicial to him.  All the VCAA requires is that the duty \r\nto notify is satisfied, and that claimants be given the \r\nopportunity to submit information and evidence in support of \r\ntheir claims.  Once this has been accomplished, all due \r\nprocess concerns have been satisfied.  See Bernard v. Brown, \r\n4 Vet. App. 384 (1993); Sutton v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 553 \r\n(1996); see also 38 C.F.R. � 20.1102 (harmless error).  \r\n\r\nDuty to assist\r\n\r\nWith regard to the duty to assist, the claims file contains \r\nthe veteran's service medical records and reports of post-\r\nservice VA treatment and examination.  Additionally, the \r\nclaims file contains the veteran's statements in support of \r\nhis claim.  The Board has carefully reviewed his statements \r\nand concludes that there has been no identification of \r\nfurther available evidence not already of record.  The Board \r\nhas also perused the medical records for references to \r\nadditional treatment reports not of record, but has found \r\nnothing to suggest that there is any outstanding evidence \r\nwith respect to the veteran's claim.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the veteran's line of duty reports have \r\nnot been obtained.  The evidence of record reflects that the \r\nRO attempted to obtain the veteran's line of duty reports \r\nregarding a motor vehicle accident in March 2002.  The \r\nNational Personnel Records Center's (NPRC) response, dated in \r\nNovember 2002, stated that an extensive search had been \r\nconducted, and that the records either do not exist or are \r\nnot in their possession.   Additionally, the RO and the \r\nveteran have submitted requests to the U.S. Army Crime \r\nRecords Center (CRC) because the veteran stated that the \r\nMilitary Police arrived at the accident and questioned him \r\nabout it.  The CRC maintains the Army's investigative \r\ninformation, including Criminal Investigation Division \r\nrecords and military police reports.  The CRC indexes the \r\nrecords by the name of the victim and type of crime.  Replies \r\nfrom the CRC in June 2001, August 2001, and March 2002 \r\nindicated that no records are responsive to the request.  A \r\nhand-written note at the bottom of an April 2002 response \r\ncontained a statement that no records could be located.  The \r\nabove requests by the RO included the veteran's name, his \r\nsocial security number, his date of birth, and the month, \r\nyear, and place of the alleged stressor.  Even with this \r\ninformation, each response to these requests noted that the \r\nveteran's records could not be identified based on the \r\ninformation furnished.  \r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the Board finds that adequate efforts \r\nwere undertaken by the RO in developing the veteran's claim.  \r\nIt is not felt that additional efforts are necessary under \r\nthe VCAA given the RO's multiple attempts noted above.  As \r\nsuch, it appears that further development would serve no \r\nuseful purpose and would result in unnecessarily imposing \r\nadditional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the \r\nveteran.  See Soyini v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 \r\n(1991); Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).  The \r\nBoard finds that all relevant facts have been properly and \r\nsufficiently developed in this appeal and no further \r\ndevelopment is required to comply with the duty to assist the \r\nveteran in developing the facts pertinent to his claim.  \r\nEssentially, all available evidence that could substantiate \r\nthe claim has been obtained.  \r\n\r\nLegal criteria \r\n\r\nThe Board has reviewed all of the evidence in the veteran's \r\nclaims file.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide \r\nreasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need \r\nto discuss, in detail, the extensive evidence of record.  \r\nIndeed, the Federal Circuit has held that the Board must \r\nreview the entire record, but does not have to discuss each \r\npiece of evidence.  Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 \r\n(Fed. Cir. 2000).  Therefore, the Board will summarize the \r\nrelevant evidence where appropriate, and the Board's analysis \r\nbelow will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or \r\nfails to show, as to the claim.\r\n\r\nService connection- in general\r\n\r\nAccording to the law, service connection is warranted if it \r\nis shown that a veteran has a disability resulting from an \r\ninjury incurred or a disease contracted in active service or \r\nfor aggravation of a preexisting injury or disease in active \r\nmilitary service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.303 (2006).  Service connection may also be granted for \r\nany disease diagnosed after discharge when all of the \r\nevidence establishes that the disease was incurred in \r\nservice.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).  \r\n\r\n\"Generally, to prove service connection, a claimant must \r\nsubmit (1) medical evidence of a current disability, (2) \r\nmedical evidence, or in certain circumstances lay testimony, \r\nof in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or \r\ndisease, and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the \r\ncurrent disability and the in-service disease or injury.\"  \r\nPond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341, 346 (1999).  Where the \r\ndeterminative issue involves a medical diagnosis, competent \r\nmedical evidence is required.  This burden typically cannot \r\nbe met by lay testimony because lay persons are not competent \r\nto offer medical opinions.  Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. \r\nApp. 492, 494-95 (1992).\r\n\r\nSpecial considerations- PTSD\r\n\r\nIn order to establish service connection for PTSD, the \r\nevidence of record must include a medical diagnosis of the \r\ncondition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a), a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence, between current symptoms and \r\nan in-service stressor, and credible supporting evidence that \r\nthe claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.304(f) (2006).  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) \r\nrequire that a diagnosis of a mental disorder conform to the \r\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL \r\nMANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS, FOURTH EDITION 1994 (4th ed.) (DSM-IV).\r\n\r\nFurther relating to claims of service connection for PTSD, in \r\nZarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91 (1993), the Court has set \r\nforth the analytical framework and line of reasoning for \r\ndetermining whether a veteran was exposed to a recognizable \r\nstressor during service, which, as discussed above, is an \r\nessential element in solidifying a claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD.  In Zarycki, it was noted that, under 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1154(b), 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d) and (f), and the \r\napplicable provisions contained in VA Manual 21-1, the \r\nevidence necessary to establish the incurrence of a \r\nrecognizable stressor during service to support a claim of \r\nservice connection for PTSD will vary depending on whether \r\nthe veteran \"engaged in combat with the enemy.\"  See Hayes v. \r\nBrown, 5 Vet. App. 60 (1993).  The determination as to \r\nwhether the veteran \"engaged in combat with the enemy\" is \r\nmade, in part, by considering military citations that \r\nexpressly denote as much.  Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, \r\n289 (1994).  However, the Court has held that the Board may \r\nnot rely strictly on combat citations or the veteran's \r\nmilitary occupational specialty to determine if he engaged in \r\ncombat; rather, other supportive evidence of combat \r\nexperience may also be accepted.  See Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 \r\nVet. App. 163, 166 (1996); West v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 70, 76 \r\n(1994).  If combat is affirmatively indicated, then the \r\nveteran's lay testimony regarding claimed combat-related \r\nstressors must be accepted as conclusive as to their actual \r\noccurrence and no further development or corroborative \r\nevidence will be required, provided that the veteran's \r\ntestimony is found to be \"satisfactory,\" i.e., credible, and \r\n\"consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof such service.\"  Zarycki, 6 Vet. App. at 98.\r\n\r\nIf there is no combat experience, or if there is a \r\ndetermination that the veteran engaged in combat but the \r\nclaimed stressor is not related to such combat, there must be \r\nindependent evidence to corroborate the veteran's statement \r\nas to the occurrence of the claimed stressor.  Doran, 6 Vet. \r\nApp. at 288-89.  The veteran's testimony, by itself, cannot, \r\nas a matter of law, establish the occurrence of a non-combat \r\nstressor.  Dizoglio, 9 Vet. App. at 166.  Further, an opinion \r\nby a mental health professional based on a post-service \r\nexamination of the veteran cannot be used to establish the \r\noccurrence of a stressor.  Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, \r\n395-96 (1996); Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nAs previously noted, in order to establish a claim of \r\nentitlement to service connection for PTSD, it is necessary \r\nto show that an in-service stressor occurred.\r\nThe veteran claims that his PTSD stressor is associated with \r\nhis active service in Korea.  If combat is affirmatively \r\nindicated, then the veteran's lay testimony regarding claimed \r\ncombat- related stressors must be accepted as conclusive as \r\nto their actual occurrence and no further development or \r\ncorroborative evidence will be required.  However, in this \r\ncase, the record does not establish, and the veteran does not \r\ncontend, that his in-service stressor is related to engaging \r\nin combat activity with the enemy.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran states that his in-service stressor occurred when \r\nhe served abroad in Korea.  The veteran reported that in the \r\nfall of 1966 he was driving a military vehicle back towards \r\nthe camp when he struck and killed a seven-year old Korean \r\ngirl.  As this is a non-combat related incident, there must \r\nbe independent evidence to corroborate the veteran's \r\nstatements as to the occurrence of his claimed stressor.  In \r\nthis case, the Board finds that the record does not contain \r\nany such evidence.  \r\n\r\nOther than the veteran's statements regarding the occurrence \r\nof the aforementioned stressor, the claims folder does not \r\ncontain any additional evidence of its actual happening.  The \r\nBoard notes, as discussed above and below, the RO has made \r\nseveral attempts to research the veteran's claimed stressor \r\nwith multiple military divisions.  \r\n\r\nThe Board further notes that in the December 2002 rating \r\ndecision the RO outlined its reasons for not submitting a \r\nrequest for verification of this incident to the United \r\nStates Armed Services Center for Unit Records Research \r\n(USASCURR), which is now called the U. S. Army and Joint \r\nServices Records Research Center (JSRRC) and will be referred \r\nto as such.  The RO reasoned that JSRRC is only able to \r\nsearch for records regarding the units and military \r\ncasualties and cannot locate records regarding civilian \r\ndeaths.  The Board finds the reasoning set forth for not \r\nsubmitting a JSRRC request in the December 2002 rating \r\ndecision is both logical and supportable.  The RO also stated \r\nthat the veteran has not provided the name of the person \r\nkilled.  In this regard, the Board notes that the veteran has \r\nbeen requested, and has had ample opportunity, to submit the \r\nname of the civilian girl killed in this incident.  Indeed, \r\nin the veteran's response to a PTSD questionnaire, in April \r\n2000, the name of the casualty was listed as \"unknown 7 yr \r\nold Korean Girl.\"\r\n\r\nThe Board acknowledges that in a December 2002 VA \r\nexamination, the examiner diagnosed the veteran with PTSD.  \r\nThe Board notes that the veteran was previously diagnosed \r\nwith PTSD, to include a January 2000 psychological \r\nevaluation.  However, the validity of such diagnoses is \r\ndependent on the existence of a verified in-service stressor.  \r\nThe veteran's contention that he was driving a military \r\nvehicle that struck and killed a seven-year old Korean girl, \r\nhis stressor, is unsupported by the objective evidence of \r\nrecord.  Indeed, the Court has held on a number of occasions \r\nthat a medical opinion premised upon an unsubstantiated \r\naccount of a claimant is of no probative value.  See, e.g., \r\nSwann v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 229, 233 (1993) (generally \r\nobserving that a medical opinion premised upon an \r\nunsubstantiated account is of no probative value, and does \r\nnot serve to verify the occurrences described); Reonal v. \r\nBrown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (stating that the Board is \r\nnot bound to accept a physician's opinion when it is based \r\nexclusively on the recitations of a claimant).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the available evidence of record is \r\ninsufficient to verify the veteran's in-service stressor.  \r\nUnfortunately, multiple attempts to verify the incident were \r\nunsuccessful and the veteran has not submitted any other \r\nevidence in corroboration of his claimed stressors.  \r\nTherefore, in the absence of objective evidence to \r\ncorroborate the veteran's presence as to the event he \r\ndescribed, the claim of entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD must be denied.  As the preponderance of the evidence is \r\nagainst the claim, the benefit of the doubt rule is not \r\napplicable.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, \r\n1 Vet. App. 49, 54-56 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nU. R.

Gunn, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from November 1969 to \r\nAugust 1973.  He is a Vietnam veteran.\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from a May 2003 rating decision of the Oakland, \r\nCalifornia, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional \r\nOffice (RO).  The RO denied service connection for the \r\nfollowing conditions:  AIDS/HIV, leukoencephalopathy and \r\nbrain injury; progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; \r\nbrain injury with weakness, numbness and paralysis of the \r\nleft side; and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  The \r\nveteran contests the issue of service connection for post-\r\ntraumatic stress disorder.\r\n\r\nIn September 2006, the appellant testified at a video \r\nconference hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge.  \r\nA copy of the transcript of that hearing is of record.\r\n\r\nThe issue of entitlement to service connection for post-\r\ntraumatic stress disorder is addressed in the REMAND portion \r\nof the decision below and is REMANDED to the RO via the \r\nAppeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran seeks service connection for post-traumatic \r\nstress disorder (PTSD) based upon an alleged sexual assault \r\nwhich occurred during his military service.  The veteran \r\nexplained in his December 2002 stressor statement that in \r\nDecember 1971, while stationed at Naha Air Force Base in \r\nOkinawa, Japan, he was raped and sodomized by Army personnel.  \r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � \r\n4.125(a) (i.e., under the criteria of DSM-IV); a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence, between the veteran's \r\ncurrent symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor \r\noccurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  If a PTSD claim is based on \r\nin-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than \r\nthe veteran's service records may corroborate the veteran's \r\naccount of the stressor incident.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) \r\n(2006).  \r\n\r\nThe evidence of record establishes that the veteran has been \r\ndiagnosed as having multiple psychiatric problems, including, \r\nbut not limited to, depression, dysthymic disorder, and PTSD.  \r\nThe Board notes that in a December 2002 VA treatment report, \r\na VA clinical psychologist diagnosed the veteran as having \r\nPTSD.  Subsequent VA treatment reports in 2003 contain a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD.  But, the etiology of the diagnosis has \r\nnever been definitely expressed.  At this time, it is unclear \r\nas to whether the diagnosed disorder is possibly related to \r\nthe veteran's alleged in-service sexual assault, or other \r\nmedical conditions discussed in the record.  In light of \r\nsuch, the Board finds that a VA examination is necessary to \r\nclarify the diagnosis with regard to PTSD.  \r\n\r\nFurther review of the record shows the veteran has not been \r\nprovided with specific notice of certain provisions that \r\napply to cases involving PTSD based on allegations of \r\npersonal or sexual assault.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) \r\n(2006).  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) was revised in \r\n2002 to provide for specific notification to claimants \r\nalleging an undocumented personal assault in service \r\nconcerning the types of evidence other than service records \r\nwhich could be submitted to corroborate such assault.  In \r\nparticular, if a PTSD claim is based on in-service personal \r\nassault, evidence from sources other than the veteran's \r\nservice records may corroborate the veteran's account of the \r\nstressor incident.  Examples of such evidence include, but \r\nare not limited to the following:  records from law \r\nenforcement authorities, mental health counseling centers, \r\nhospitals, or physicians; and statements from family members, \r\nroommates, fellow service members, or clergy.  Evidence of \r\nbehavior changes following the claimed assault is one type of \r\nrelevant evidence that may be found in these sources.  \r\nExamples of behavior changes that may constitute credible \r\nevidence of the stressor include, but are not limited to the \r\nfollowing:  a request for a transfer to another military duty \r\nassignment; deterioration in work performance; substance \r\nabuse; episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety \r\nwithout an identifiable cause; or unexplained economic or \r\nsocial behavior changes.  VA will not deny a post-traumatic \r\nstress disorder claim that is based on in-service personal \r\nassault without first advising the claimant that evidence \r\nfrom sources other than the veteran's service records or \r\nevidence of behavior changes may constitute credible \r\nsupporting evidence of the stressor and allowing him the \r\nopportunity to furnish this type of evidence or advise VA of \r\npotential sources of such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.304(f)(3) (2006).  \r\n\r\nThe record does not indicate that the veteran was provided \r\nwith sufficient notice of the provisions set forth in 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3).  The Board finds that such provisions \r\nshould be issued to the veteran.  See Patton v. West, 12 Vet. \r\nApp. 272 (1999).\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances of this case, the Board finds that \r\nadditional development of the record is required.  \r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Contact the veteran and notify him of the \r\nopportunity to furnish, or to advise VA of the \r\npotential source or sources of evidence other than \r\nhis service records or evidence of behavioral \r\nchanges that might constitute credible supporting \r\nevidence of his purported inservice stressor.  38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.304.  Specific examples of corroborating \r\nalternative evidence should be provided.\r\n\r\n2.  Following completion of the above, schedule the \r\nveteran with a VA examination relative to his claim \r\nfor service connection for PTSD based on alleged \r\npersonal assault.  The claims folder must be \r\nprovided to and be reviewed by the examiner, along \r\nwith a copy of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (f)(3).  The \r\nexaminer should diagnose all psychiatric disorders, \r\nand specifically diagnose or rule out PTSD in \r\naccordance with the criteria of DSM-IV.  If PTSD is \r\ndiagnosed, the examiner should identify the \r\npurported stressor leading to PTSD.  \r\n\r\n3.  Readjudicate the claim for entitlement to \r\nservice connection for PTSD.  In doing so, review \r\nthe historical records for evidence which might \r\nreflect that the alleged sexual assault actually \r\noccurred during active duty.  If the benefit sought \r\nis not granted, the veteran and his representative \r\nshould be furnished a supplemental statement of the \r\ncase, and afforded a reasonable opportunity to \r\nrespond before the record is returned to the Board \r\nfor further review.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2005).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nJAMES L.

Frost, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant had active air service from June 1968 to March \r\n1969, with time lost by reason of being absent without leave \r\n(AWOL) from duty in December 1968 and January 1969.  \r\n\r\nThis appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) arises \r\nfrom rating decisions in April 1996 and May 1997 by the Waco, \r\nTexas, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA).\r\n\r\nIn September, the appellant testified at a hearing before the \r\nundersigned Acting Veterans Law Judge at the RO.  A \r\ntranscript of that hearing is of record.  In January 2005, \r\nthe Board remanded this case.\r\n\r\nFor good cause shown, a motion to advance this appeal on the \r\nBoard's docket has been granted under the authority of \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 7107(a) (West 2002) and 38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c) \r\n(2006).\r\n   \r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The in-service stressors claimed by the appellant are not \r\nrelated to military combat with an enemy of the United States \r\nof America.\r\n\r\n2.  The appellant's claimed in-service stressors have not \r\nbeen verified by official military records.\r\n\r\n3.  There is no credible supporting evidence of record that \r\nthe appellant's claimed in-service stressors occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, \r\n3.304(f) (2006).    \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting \r\nfrom a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by \r\nservice. 38 U.S.C.A. � 1110.  \r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires (i) medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing PTSD, (ii) a link, established by medical \r\nevidence, between current symptoms and an in-service \r\nstressor, and (iii) credible supporting evidence that the in-\r\nservice stressor occurred.  If the evidence establishes that \r\nthe veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed \r\nstressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear \r\nand convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that \r\nthe claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, \r\nconditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the \r\nveteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of \r\nthe claimed in-service stressor.  If, however, VA determines \r\nthat the veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy, the \r\nveteran's lay testimony, by itself, is not sufficient to \r\nestablish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.  Instead, \r\nthe record must contain credible supporting evidence which \r\ncorroborates the veteran's testimony or statements.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f); see also 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b); Cohen \r\nv. Brown, \r\n10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).\r\n\r\nIn this case, there is no dispute as to whether the \r\nappellant's alleged in-service stressors are related to \r\ncombat.  There is nothing in the claims folder to indicate \r\nthat the reported incidents were incurred during combat and \r\nthe veteran does not allege that they are related to combat.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant has claimed to have experienced the following \r\ntwo stressors during service: (1) in December 1968, during a \r\nperiod of time when he was in the custody of Air Force \r\nmilitary police and detention facility personnel, he was \r\nsubjected to physical and psychological abuse by military \r\nprison guards whose names and identities he has not provided \r\nto VA and; (2) in January 1969, his reaction to being \r\ninvolved in the collision of two Air Force jeeps while he was \r\na passenger in one of the jeeps being transported from one \r\nAir Force base in Alabama to another one for an appearance in \r\na military court.  In written statements to VA and in hearing \r\ntestimony, the appellant has said that the other jeep rolled \r\nover and that the driver or one of the passengers in the \r\nother jeep was seriously injured and may have died as a \r\nresult of injuries in such jeep accident.  \r\n\r\nIn a May 2005 response to a VA request for information, the \r\nAir Force Office of Special Investigations reported that no \r\nrecords were found to confirm either incident.  \r\n\r\nWith regard to the first claimed in-service stressor, the \r\nappellant has not submitted any supporting evidence, such as \r\nan affidavit by an eyewitness or by some other person \r\nclaiming to have personal knowledge of the appellant's \r\nalleged abuse in December 1968 by the military prison guards, \r\nnor has he or his representative identified any existing \r\nevidence which would tend to support or corroborate the \r\nappellant's statements concerning such alleged abuse.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the appellant's second claimed in-service \r\nstressor arising out of an alleged collision of two military \r\njeeps, VA requested that the U.S. Army and Joint Services \r\nRecords Research Center (JSRRC) attempt by research of \r\nofficial military records to verify that in January 1969 a \r\ncollision with personal injuries of two Air Force jeeps \r\noccurred in Alabama.  In March 2006, the JSRRC reported to VA \r\nthat after extensive research, the jeep accident as described \r\nby the appellant could not be documented.  The veteran and \r\nhis representative have not submitted to VA any supporting \r\nevidence tending to show that such an incident occurred at \r\nthe time and place described by him.  No supporting evidence \r\nwhatsoever having been presented or identified, there is no \r\ncredible evidence that the appellant's second claimed in-\r\nservice stressor occurred.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the appellant received a diagnosis of PTSD during \r\nhospitalization in 1995 at a VA medical facility and the \r\nrecord includes subsequent diagnoses of PTSD, service \r\nconnection may not be granted for PTSD unless all of the \r\nrequirements of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) have been fulfilled, \r\nincluding, for a stressor or stressors not related to combat, \r\ncredible supporting evidence of the occurrence of the claimed \r\nstressor(s) on which the diagnosis of PTSD was based by the \r\npsychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health \r\nprofessional who rendered it.  There is no such credible \r\nsupporting evidence in this case of the occurrence of either \r\nof the appellant's two claimed in-service stressors.\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the evidence of record is against a \r\ngrant of service connection for PTSD.  The benefit-of-the-\r\ndoubt doctrine does not apply.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); \r\nGilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App 49 (1990).  The claim must \r\nbe denied \r\n\r\nIn correspondence dated in May 2005, VA satisfied its duty to \r\nnotify the veteran under 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.159(b).  Specifically, VA notified the veteran of \r\ninformation and evidence necessary to substantiate the claim; \r\ninformation and evidence that VA would seek to provide; and \r\ninformation and evidence that the veteran was expected to \r\nprovide.  The veteran was instructed to submit any evidence \r\nin his possession that pertained to his claim.  VA \r\nsubsequently readjudicated the claim based on all the \r\nevidence in May and November 2006, without taint from prior \r\nadjudications.  Thus, the veteran was not precluded from \r\nparticipating effectively in the processing of his claim and \r\nany deficiency in the notice did not affect the essential \r\nfairness of the decision.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d \r\n1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006).\r\n\r\nBecause service connection is denied for PTSD, any question \r\nas to the appropriate disability rating or effective date is \r\nmoot, and there can be no failure to notify prejudice to the \r\nveteran.  See Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 \r\n(2006).\r\n\r\nVA has done everything reasonably possible to assist the \r\nveteran with respect the claims decided herein.  Service \r\nmedical records and post-service medical records have been \r\nassociated with the claims file and efforts were made to \r\nofficially confirm the stressors described by the veteran.  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress \r\ndisorder is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nM.

J. Alibrando, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from August 1962 to August \r\n1965.\r\n\r\nThe present matter comes before the Board of Veterans' \r\nAppeals (Board) on appeal from a February 1997 rating \r\ndecision in which the RO denied the veteran's claim of \r\nservice connection for PTSD.  In January 1998, the veteran \r\nfiled a notice of disagreement (NOD).  A statement of the \r\ncase (SOC) was issued in March 1998, and the veteran filed a \r\nsubstantive appeal (via a VA Form 9, Appeal to the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals) in June 1998.\r\n\r\nIn December 2003, the Board remanded the claim on appeal to \r\nthe RO for additional development of the evidence.  After \r\naccomplishing further action, the RO continued the denial of \r\nthe claim (as reflected in an November 2005 supplemental SOC \r\n(SSOC)) and returned this matter to the Board for further \r\nappellate consideration.\r\n\r\nIn October 2006, the veteran testified during a hearing \r\nbefore the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in Washington, \r\nD.C.; a transcript of that hearing is of record. During the \r\nhearing, the appellant submitted additional evidence to the \r\nBoard, waiving initial RO consideration of the evidence.  The \r\nveteran also requested, and the undersigned granted, a 30-day \r\nabeyance period within which to submit additional evidence.  \r\nIn January 2007, the veteran's representative submitted \r\nadditional evidence, accompanied by a motion to accept the \r\nevidence out of time and a waiver of RO jurisdiction.  The \r\nBoard accepts the evidence for inclusion in the record.  See \r\n38 C.F.R. � 20.800 (2006).\r\n\r\nFor the reason expressed below, the matter on appeal is, \r\nagain, being remanded to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant when further action, on his part, is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the claims file reflects that another remand \r\nof the claim for service connection for PTSD is warranted, \r\neven though such action will, regrettably, further delay an \r\nappellate decision.\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � \r\n4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between \r\ncurrent symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the in-service stressor occurred.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2006).\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that he has PTSD as a result of \r\nstressful events during service in both Ethiopia and Vietnam.  \r\nHe most recently submitted a detailed statement regarding his \r\nclaim stressors and testified during a hearing before the \r\nundersigned October 2006.  \r\n\r\nAt the outset, the Board notes that the veteran has reported \r\na number of incidents as stressors.  He reported that he was \r\nattacked by a ARVN soldier with a bayonet in March 1965, and \r\nthat he sustained a superficial wound to the hand that was \r\nnot treated.  He also asserted that he was present at the \r\ntime of explosions at the My Canh floating restaurant in \r\nSaigon in June 1964.  He has reported that while Africa, he \r\nwas involved in a automobile accident, but did not report the \r\ndate of that accident.  He has also asserted that in October \r\nor November 1964, he saw an injured child after being shot by \r\na Canadian soldier.  Another contended stressor was the \r\nJanuary 1965 crash of a plane flown by [redacted], a \r\nfriend from basic training, which was not witnessed by the \r\nveteran.  In addition, the veteran has indicated that while \r\nstationed at Tan San Nhut Air Force Base (AFB) in Vietnam, \r\nthe base attacked with mortar rounds on several occasions.  \r\nHe indicated that during those attacks, he and his unit would \r\ngo out in defense of the perimeter.  He also indicated that \r\non December 24, 1964, his unit was tear-gassed.  \r\n\r\nThe RO has attempted to verify the veteran's stressors.  In \r\nApril 2003, USACURR indicated that unit records of the 3rd \r\nRRU were not maintained and the request was forwarded to the \r\nCommander, U.S. Army INSCOM.  In May 2003, the Command \r\nHistorian for INSCOM indicated that the office was unable to \r\ncorroborate the information regarding the claimed stressors \r\nor verify the veteran's assignment to the 3rd RRU, indicated \r\nthat the pertinent unit records, operational in nature and \r\ncontaining only names of key personnel, classified and could \r\nnot released.  The Board also notes that most of the above-\r\ncited stressors are not objectively verifiable, as they are \r\ngeneral in description and involve events that would not be \r\ncontained in a unit history or operational report.  Anecdotal \r\nexperiences of this type simply cannot be verified \r\nindependently.  See Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 134 \r\n(1997) (\"Anecdotal incidents, although they may be true, are \r\nnot researchable.  In order to be researched, incidents must \r\nbe reported and documented.\").\r\n\r\nHowever, the veteran's alleged in-service stressful \r\nexperiences also involve his reported voluntary service in \r\nVietnam as a door gunner and an assault while serving in \r\nEthiopia.  The veteran has asserts that between October and \r\nDecember 1964, he volunteered and flew missions as a door \r\ngunner in \"Operation Shotgun\", possibly as part of the  \r\n145th Aviation Unit.  In December 2006 statement, Mr. N, as \r\nservice comrade, indicated that he had known the veteran for \r\nover 30 years, including the time they had served in Africa \r\nand Vietnam and could attest to his voluntary service as a \r\ndoor gunner.  The veteran has also reported that in February \r\n1963, he and D. L. N. were attacked by two men in a robbery \r\nattempt.  He was hit on the head with a rock.  Mr. N. helped \r\nthe veteran back to the post hospital and he was treated with \r\nstitches.  A January 2005 statement of Mr. N. corroborates \r\nthat assault.  He related that the veteran had a head wound \r\nwhich was treated at the Kagnew Station Hospital.  The \r\nservice medical records show that the veteran was treated for \r\na scalp laceration in February 1963.\r\n\r\nThe veteran's corrected DD Form 214, and available service \r\npersonnel and administrative records currently associated \r\nwith the claims file reflect that his military occupational \r\nspecialty was administrative specialist.  These records \r\ndocument he served in Asmara, Ethiopia with the 4th USASAFS \r\nfrom January 1963 to July 1964 and in Vietnam with the 3rd \r\nRadio Research Unit (RRU) from August 1964 to August 1965.  \r\nHe received the Vietnam Service Medal and the Republic of \r\nVietnam Campaign Medal Ribbon.  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that, collectively, the aforementioned lay \r\nand objective evidence tends to corroborate the veteran's \r\nassertions of the in-service assault in Ethiopia and his \r\nvoluntary service as a door gunner while in Vietnam, and that \r\nthese experiences were apparently stressful to him.  Inasmuch \r\nas the Board has determined that credible evidence \r\ncorroborates the occurrence of these, and only these, in-\r\nservice stressors, questions remain as to whether the \r\nremaining criteria for PTSD are met-namely, diagnosis and \r\nsymptoms associated with the corroborated stressors.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that, in January 2007, the veteran submitted \r\nadditional evidence with a waiver of initial RO consideration \r\nof that evidence.  Included is a November 2006 report of \r\nprivate psychological evaluation.  The examiner noted \r\nreported stressors of being in a restaurant that was bombed, \r\nwitnessing the murder of a child and assaulted by a solider \r\nin Saigon.  The examiner indicated that these were \r\nprecipitating evidence for the diagnosis of PTSD.  As \r\nindicated above, however, those events noted by the examiner \r\nare not verified.  In addition, VA outpatient treatment \r\nrecords dated from January 2003 to November 2006 were also \r\nsubmitted.  \r\n\r\nAs the aforementioned makes clear, the current record does \r\nnot include sufficient medical information to resolve the \r\nquestions remaining.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A.  Accordingly, \r\nRO should arrange for the veteran to undergo VA psychiatric \r\nexamination, by a physician, at an appropriate VA medical \r\nfacility.  The veteran is hereby advised that failure to \r\nreport for any scheduled VA examination, without good cause, \r\nmay well result in denial of the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.655 (2006).  Examples of good cause include, but are not \r\nlimited to, the illness or hospitalization of the claimant \r\nand death of an immediate family member.  Id.  If the \r\nappellant does not report for the scheduled examination, the \r\nRO must obtain and associate with the claims file a copy of \r\nany notice(s) of the date and time of the examination sent to \r\nhim by the pertinent VA medical facility.\r\n\r\nPrior to arranging for the veteran to undergo further \r\nexamination, the RO should obtain and associate with the \r\nclaims file all outstanding VA medical records.  The claims \r\nfile currently includes outpatient treatment records from \r\nMilwaukee VA Medical Center (VAMC) dated from November 1996 \r\nto November 2006.  The Board emphasizes that records \r\ngenerated by VA facilities that may have an impact on the \r\nadjudication of a claim are considered constructively in the \r\npossession of VA adjudicators during the consideration of a \r\nclaim, regardless of whether those records are physically on \r\nfile.  See Dunn v. West, 11 Vet. App. 462, 466-67 (1998); \r\nBell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611, 613 (1992).  Hence, the \r\nRO must obtain all outstanding pertinent medical records from \r\nthe since November 2006, following the current procedures \r\nprescribed in 38 C.F.R. � 3.159 (2004) as regards requests \r\nfor records from Federal facilities. \r\n\r\nThe RO should also give the veteran another opportunity to \r\nprovide information and/or evidence pertinent to the claim on \r\nappeal, explaining that he has a full one-year period for \r\nresponse.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103 (b)(1)(West 2002); but see \r\nalso 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(b)(3)) (West Supp. 2005) (amending \r\nthe relevant statute to clarify that VA may make a decision \r\non a claim before the expiration of the one-year notice \r\nperiod).  The RO should also invite the appellant to submit \r\nall pertinent evidence in his possession, and ensure that its \r\nnotice to the appellant meets the requirements of the recent \r\ndecision in Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 \r\n(2006) as regards the five elements of a claim for service \r\nconnection-specifically as regards disability ratings and \r\neffective dates-as appropriate.  \r\n\r\nAfter providing the required notice, the RO should attempt to \r\nobtain any additional evidence for which the appellant \r\nprovides sufficient information and, if necessary, \r\nauthorization, following the current procedures prescribed in \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.159 (2006).  \r\n\r\nThe actions identified herein are consistent with the duties \r\nimposed by the Veterans Claim Act of 2000 (VCAA).  See \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 5103, 5103A (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159 \r\n(2006).  However, identification of specific actions \r\nrequested on remand does not relieve the RO of the \r\nresponsibility to ensure full compliance with the VCAA and \r\nits implementing regulations.  Hence, in addition to the \r\nactions requested above, the RO should also undertake any \r\nother development and/or notification action deemed warranted \r\nby the VCAA prior to adjudicating the claim on appeal.  For \r\nthe sake of efficiency, the RO's adjudication of the claim \r\nshould include consideration of evidence submitted directly \r\nto the Board, notwithstanding the veteran's waiver of RO \r\nconsideration of the evidence.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this matter is hereby REMANDED to the RO, via \r\nthe AMC, for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should obtain from the \r\nMilwaukee VAMC all outstanding pertinent \r\nrecords of evaluation and/or treatment of \r\nthe veteran's PTSD, from November 2006 to \r\nthe present.  The RO must follow the \r\nprocedures set forth in 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.159(c) as regards requesting records \r\nfrom Federal facilities.  All records \r\nand/or responses received should be \r\nassociated with the claims file.\r\n\r\n2.  The RO should send to the veteran and \r\nhis representative a letter requesting \r\nthat the veteran provide sufficient \r\ninformation, and if necessary, \r\nauthorization to enable it to obtain any \r\nadditional evidence pertinent to the \r\nclaim on appeal that is not currently of \r\nrecord.  \r\n\r\nThe RO should also invite the veteran to \r\nsubmit all pertinent evidence in his \r\npossession, and explain the type of \r\nevidence that is his ultimate \r\nresponsibility to submit.  The RO should \r\nrequest that the veteran submit all \r\nevidence in his possession, and ensure \r\nthat its letter meets the requirements of \r\nDingess/Hartman, cited to above (as \r\nappropriate).  \r\n\r\nThe RO's letter should clearly explain to \r\nthe veteran that he has a full one-year \r\nperiod to respond (although VA may decide \r\nthe claim within the one-year period).\r\n\r\n3.  If the veteran responds, the RO \r\nshould assist him in obtaining any \r\nadditional evidence identified by \r\nfollowing the current procedures set \r\nforth in 38 C.F.R. � 3.159.  All records \r\nand responses received should be \r\nassociated with the claims file.  If any \r\nrecords sought are not obtained, the RO \r\nshould notify the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative of the records that were \r\nnot obtained, explain the efforts taken \r\nto obtain them, and describe further \r\naction to be taken.\r\n\r\n4.  After associating with the claims \r\nfile all available records and/or \r\nresponses received from each contacted \r\nentity, the RO should arrange for the \r\nveteran to undergo VA examination by a \r\npsychiatrist, at an appropriate VA \r\nmedical facility.  The veteran's entire \r\nclaims file, to include a complete copy \r\nof this REMAND, must be provided to the \r\nphysician designated to examine the \r\nveteran, and the examination report \r\nshould reflect consideration of the \r\nveteran's documented medical history and \r\nassertions.  All indicated tests and \r\nstudies, to include psychological \r\ntesting, if warranted, should be \r\naccomplished (with all findings made \r\navailable to the examiner prior to the \r\ncompletion of his or her report), and all \r\nclinical findings should be reported in \r\ndetail.\r\nThe examiner should make a specific \r\ndetermination as to whether the \r\ndiagnostic criteria for PTSD are met.  In \r\nrendering such determination, the \r\nexaminer is instructed that only the \r\npersonal assault in February 1963 while \r\nstationed in Ethiopia and events \r\nassociated with his voluntary service as \r\na door gunner in Vietnam, addressed \r\nabove, may be considered for the purpose \r\nof determining whether the veteran has \r\nexperienced (an) in-service stressor(s) \r\nsufficient to have resulted in PTSD.  If \r\na diagnosis of PTSD is deemed \r\nappropriate, the examiner must identify \r\nthe specific stressor(s) underlying the \r\ndiagnosis, and should comment upon the \r\nlink between the current symptomatology \r\nand the veteran's verified stressor(s).\r\n\r\nThe examiner should set forth all \r\nexamination findings, along with the \r\ncomplete rationale for each opinion \r\nexpressed and conclusion reached, in a \r\nprinted (typewritten) report.\r\n\r\n4.  If the veteran fails to report to the \r\nscheduled examination, the RO must obtain \r\nand associate with the claims file \r\ncopy(ies) of any notice(s) of the \r\nexamination sent to the veteran by the \r\npertinent VA medical facility.\r\n\r\n5.  To help avoid future remand, the RO \r\nmust ensure that all requested actions \r\nhave been accomplished (to the extent \r\npossible) in compliance with this REMAND. \r\nIf any action is not undertaken, or is \r\ntaken in a deficient manner, appropriate \r\ncorrective action should be undertaken.  \r\nSee Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 \r\n(1998).\r\n\r\n6.  After completing the requested \r\nactions, and any additional notification \r\nand/or development deemed warranted, the \r\nRO should readjudicate the claim for \r\nentitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD, in light of all pertinent evidence \r\n(to include that submitted directly to \r\nthe Board) and legal authority.\r\n\r\n7.  If the benefit sought on appeal \r\nremains denied, the RO must furnish to \r\nthe veteran and his representative an \r\nappropriate supplemental SOC that \r\nincludes clear reasons and bases for all \r\ndeterminations, and afford them the \r\nappropriate time period for response \r\nbefore the claims file is returned to the \r\nBoard for further appellate \r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this REMAND is to afford due process and to \r\naccomplish additional development and adjudication, and it is \r\nnot the Board's intent to imply whether the benefits \r\nrequested should be granted or denied.  The veteran need take \r\nno action until otherwise notified, but he may furnish \r\nadditional evidence and/or argument during the appropriate \r\ntime period.  See Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 \r\n(1999); Colon v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 104, 108 (1996); Booth v. \r\nBrown, 8 Vet. App. 109 (1995); Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. \r\nApp. 129, 141 (1992).\r\n\r\nThis REMAND must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2005).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nJACQUELINE E.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' \r\nAppeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2002 rating \r\ndecision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional \r\nOffice (RO) in Chicago, Illinois.  The veteran's claims \r\nfolder was subsequently transferred to the RO in Atlanta, \r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nThe veteran testified before the undersigned Veterans Law \r\nJudge at a videoconference hearing in November 2005.  A \r\ntranscript of that hearing has been associated with the \r\nclaims folder.  \r\n\r\nThe case returns to the Board following a remand to the RO in \r\nApril 2006.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence of hypertension in service or for years \r\nthereafter, no competent evidence of a nexus between \r\nhypertension and the veteran's period of service or his \r\nservice-connected PTSD, and no competent evidence that the \r\nservice-connected PTSD has aggravated the hypertension.   \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nService connection for hypertension, to include as secondary \r\nto service-connected PTSD, is not established.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n�� 1101, 1110, 1112, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, \r\n3.307, 3.309, 3.310(a) (2006).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted if the evidence \r\ndemonstrates that a current disability resulted from an \r\ninjury or disease incurred or aggravated in active military \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.303(a) (2004).  Service connection may be demonstrated \r\neither by showing direct service incurrence or aggravation or \r\nby using applicable presumptions, if available.  Combee v. \r\nBrown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994).   \r\n\r\nDirect service connection generally requires evidence of a \r\ncurrent disability with a relationship or connection to an \r\ninjury or disease or some other manifestation of the \r\ndisability during service.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, \r\n1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  A disorder may be service connected \r\nif the evidence of record reveals that the veteran currently \r\nhas a disorder that was chronic in service or, if not \r\nchronic, that was seen in service with continuity of \r\nsymptomatology demonstrated thereafter.  38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.303(b); Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 494-97 (1997).  \r\nDisorders diagnosed after discharge may still be service \r\nconnected if all the evidence, including pertinent service \r\nrecords, establishes that the disorder was incurred in \r\nservice.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nSome chronic diseases are presumed to have been incurred in \r\nservice, although not otherwise established as such, if \r\nmanifested to a degree of ten percent or more within one year \r\nof the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n1112(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. � 3.307(a)(3); see 38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n1101(3) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(a) (listing applicable chronic \r\ndiseases, including hypertension).  \r\n\r\nIn addition, a disability is service connected if it is \r\nproximately due to or the result of a service connected \r\ndisease or injury.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310(a).  Secondary service \r\nconnection may also be established when there is aggravation \r\nof a veteran's non-service connected condition that is \r\nproximately due to or the result of a service-connected \r\ncondition.  Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995); \r\nTobin v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 34, 39 (1991).    \r\n\r\nWhere the determinative issue involves medical causation or a \r\nmedical diagnosis, there must be competent medical evidence \r\nto the effect that the claim is plausible; lay assertions of \r\nmedical status do not constitute competent medical evidence.  \r\nGrottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 (1993); Espiritu v. \r\nDerwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 494 (1992).  When there is an \r\napproximate balance of positive and negative evidence \r\nregarding any issue material to the determination, the \r\nbenefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n5107(b).\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that service connection for hypertension, to \r\ninclude as secondary to service-connected PTSD, is not in \r\norder.  Although the veteran is currently diagnosed as having \r\nhypertension, there is no evidence of hypertension in service \r\nor for years thereafter.  The veteran's April 1963 pre-\r\ninduction examination tested his blood pressure at 104/78 mm \r\nHg, while his August 1967 separation examination tested his \r\nblood pressure at 122/72 mm Hg. Hypertension was not \r\ndiagnosed on either examination.  In fact, the veteran \r\nrelated at his July 2006 VA hypertension examination that his \r\nhypertension problems did not have their onset until the \r\n1970s, years after his separation from service.  Therefore, \r\nservice connection may not be established on a presumptive \r\nbasis.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1112(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. � 3.307(a)(3).  \r\nNor may service connection be established based on chronicity \r\nin service or continuity of symptomatology after service.  38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.303(b); Savage, 10 Vet. App. at 494-97.  \r\n\r\nFinally, there is no competent evidence of a nexus between \r\nthe veteran's hypertension and his period of service or his \r\nservice-connected PTSD.  Specifically, the July 2006 VA \r\nexaminer noted that PTSD is not listed as a cause of \r\nhypertension and that, while the emotional upset associated \r\nwith PTSD can result in some elevation of blood pressure, \r\nsuch elevation is considered temporary, not longstanding, and \r\nnot the cause of hypertension.  Similarly, in a September \r\n2006 addendum to the VA hypertension examination, the \r\nphysician opined that it is not at least as likely as not \r\nthat the veteran's hypertension is secondary to PTSD (i.e., \r\nthat the veteran's hypertension was not at least as likely as \r\nnot caused or aggravated by his PTSD).  The physician further \r\ncommented that the veteran had hypertension for 30 years \r\n(while he was only relatively recently diagnosed with PTSD) \r\nand had a history of alcohol abuse, heavy cigarette smoking, \r\ngambling, and gout, all of which can cause or aggravate \r\nhypertension.   There is no contrary, competent medical \r\nopinion of record.  Again, the veteran's personal, lay \r\nopinion as to any relationship between his hypertension and \r\nhis period of service or his PTSD is not competent evidence \r\nrequired to establish service connection.  Grottveit, 5 Vet. \r\nApp. at 93; Espiritu, 2 Vet. App. at 494.  Accordingly, the \r\nBoard finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against \r\nservice connection for hypertension, to include as secondary \r\nto service-connected PTSD.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b).  \r\n\r\nThe Duty to Notify and the Duty to Assist\r\n\r\nReview of the claims folder reveals compliance with the duty \r\nto notify.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a).  That is, by letters dated \r\nSeptember 2002, June 2004, and April 2006, as well as in the \r\nMarch 2003 statement of the case and June 2005 and December \r\n2006 supplemental statements of the case, the RO advised the \r\nveteran of the evidence needed to substantiate his claim and \r\nexplained what evidence it was obligated to obtain or to \r\nassist the veteran in obtaining and what information or \r\nevidence the veteran was responsible for providing.  In \r\naddition, the March 2003 statement of the case and June 2005 \r\nand December 2006 supplemental statements of the case include \r\nthe text of the regulation that implements the notice and \r\nassistance provisions from the statute.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the veteran did not receive specific notice \r\ninforming him to submit all relevant evidence in his \r\npossession prior to the November 2002 rating decision, \r\nPelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 120-21 (2004), the \r\nveteran was provided such notice by letter dated June 2004.  \r\nAccordingly, the Board finds that the RO has provided all \r\nrequired notice.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a), 38 C.F.R. �  \r\n3.159(b)(1); see Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 \r\n(2002).\r\n\r\nDuring the pendency of this appeal, on March 3, 2006, the \r\nCourt issued a decision in the consolidated appeal of Dingess \r\nv. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006), which held that the \r\nnotice requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.159(b) apply to all five elements of a service connection \r\nclaim.  Those five elements include:  (1) veteran status; (2) \r\nexistence of a disability; (3) a connection between the \r\nveteran's service and the disability; (4) degree of \r\ndisability; and (5) effective date of the disability.  The \r\nCourt held that upon receipt of an application for a service-\r\nconnection claim, 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.159(b) require VA to review the information and the \r\nevidence presented with the claim and to provide the claimant \r\nwith notice of what information and evidence not previously \r\nprovided, if any, will assist in substantiating or is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the elements of the claim as \r\nreasonably contemplated by the application.  Additionally, \r\nthis notice must include notice that a disability rating and \r\nan effective date for the award of benefits will be assigned \r\nif service connection is awarded.  Id.  \r\n\r\nIn the present appeal, the veteran was provided with such \r\nnotice regarding disability rating and effective dates by \r\nletters dated April 2006 and June 2006.  The Board further \r\nfinds that any deficiency in the notice to the veteran or the \r\ntiming of these notices is harmless error.  See Overton v. \r\nNicholson, 20 Vet. App. 427, 435 (2006) (finding that the \r\nBoard erred by relying on various post-decisional documents \r\nto conclude that adequate 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) notice had \r\nbeen provided to the appellant, the Court found that the \r\nevidence established that the veteran was afforded a \r\nmeaningful opportunity to participate in the adjudication of \r\nhis claims, and found that the error was harmless, as the \r\nBoard has done in this case).  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the duty to assist, the RO has obtained all \r\navailable service records, VA treatment records, and a VA \r\nexamination.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(d).  In addition, the \r\nveteran provided additional medical records as well as lay \r\nevidence in the form of his own written statements and his \r\ntestimony at his November 2005 Board videoconference hearing.  \r\nAs there is no indication of outstanding evidence, the Board \r\nis satisfied that the duty to assist has been met.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for hypertension, to include as secondary \r\nto service-connected PTSD, is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nC.

Wasik, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active duty service from November 1962 to \r\nNovember 1965.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from an August 2004 rating decision by a \r\nRegional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs \r\n(VA).  The veteran testified at a personal hearing at the RO \r\nin November 2005.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required on his part.  \r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nOn November 9, 2000, the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of \r\n2000 (VCAA) became law.  Regulations implementing the VCAA \r\nhave also been published.  The VCAA and implementing \r\nregulations apply in the instant case.  In Quartuccio v. \r\nPrincipi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002) the Court of Appeals for \r\nVeterans Claims (\"the Court\") provided guidance regarding \r\nnotice requirements under the VCAA, indicating that VA must \r\nadequately identify the evidence necessary to substantiate \r\nthe claim, the evidence presently of record, and the \r\nveteran's and VA's respective responsibilities in development \r\nof evidence.  In April 2004, VA sent a letter to the veteran \r\npertaining to his claim for service connection for \r\nanxiety/depression.  The Board notes, however, that VA has \r\nnot provided guidance to the veteran as to how to \r\nsubstantiate a claim for PTSD which entails different legal \r\ncriteria.  \r\n\r\nThere is evidence of record indicating that the veteran is in \r\nreceipt of benefits from the Social Security Administration.  \r\nSome of the evidence indicates that the veteran has been \r\nreceiving Social Security disability benefits since 1989.  \r\nThe Court in Murincsak v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 363 (1992), \r\nstated that the VA's duty to assist specifically includes \r\nrequesting information from other federal departments or \r\nagencies pursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a) (West 1991).  VA \r\nmust determine if the veteran is in receipt of Social \r\nSecurity disability benefits and, if so, the documents from \r\nthe Social Security Administration pertaining to the \r\nveteran's claims, including any medical records that the \r\nSocial Security Administration has regarding the veteran, \r\nshould be associated with the claims file for review.\r\n\r\nA July 2004 VA clinical record indicates that the veteran \r\nreported he had been treated for generalized anxiety since \r\n1965.  The Board notes the earliest medical evidence dated \r\nsubsequent to the veteran's discharge in 1965 is from the \r\n2000's.  If this evidence of prior treatment is in existence, \r\nit would support the veteran's allegations of having \r\ncontinuous mental symptoms since his discharge from active \r\nduty.  The Board finds VA should contact the veteran to \r\ndetermine if there are any outstanding treatment records and, \r\nif so, should take appropriate steps to obtain the evidence \r\nidentified by the veteran if possible.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Ensure that all VCAA notice \r\nobligations are satisfied in accordance \r\nwith 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5102, 5103, and \r\n5103A, implementing regulations, \r\ninterpretative precedent Court decisions, \r\nand any other applicable legal precedent.  \r\nIn particular, the RO should ensure that \r\nthe veteran and his representative are \r\nadvised specifically of what he needs to \r\nestablish entitlement to service \r\nconnection for PTSD, what the evidence \r\nshows, of his and VA's respective \r\nresponsibilities in claims development, \r\nto submit everything he has pertinent to \r\nthe claims.  The veteran and his \r\nrepresentative should be given the \r\nopportunity to respond. \r\n\r\n2.  VA should obtain the names and \r\naddresses of all medical care providers \r\nwho treated the veteran for any mental \r\ndisorder since the veteran's discharge in \r\n1965.  After securing the necessary \r\nrelease, VA should obtain these records.  \r\n\r\n3.  VA should determine if the veteran is \r\nin receipt of Social Security disability \r\nbenefits and, if so, should obtain from \r\nthe Social Security Administration the \r\nrecords pertinent to the appellant's \r\nclaim for Social Security disability \r\nbenefits as well as the medical records \r\nrelied upon concerning that claim.\r\n\r\n4.  Thereafter, and after completing any \r\nfurther development determined to be \r\nwarranted by the RO or the AMC, the claim \r\nof entitlement to service connection for \r\nan acquired psychiatric disorder to \r\ninclude PTSD should be adjudicated based \r\non all the evidence in the claims file.  \r\nIf  the benefit sought on appeal is not  \r\ngranted to the veteran's satisfaction, a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case should \r\nbe issued, and the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative should be afforded the  \r\nrequisite opportunity to respond before \r\nthe claims folder is returned to the  \r\nBoard for further appellate action. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe veteran and his representative have the right to submit \r\nadditional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the \r\nBoard has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 \r\n(1999).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2006).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nKATHLEEN K.

B. Mays, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active military duty from August 1983 \r\nto March 1986.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from April 1993 and September 1993 rating \r\ndecisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional \r\nOffice (RO) in San Juan, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. \r\n\r\nIn October 2000, the veteran testified before the undersigned \r\nVeterans Law Judge at the VA Central Office.  A transcript of \r\nthe hearing is associated with the claims folder and has been \r\nreviewed.\r\n\r\nIn December 2000, June 2004, and July 2006, the Board \r\nremanded the case for further development.  The veteran's \r\ncase has since returned to the Board for appellate review.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.   The veteran did not have an acquired psychiatric \r\ndisability in service, the current psychiatric disability is \r\nnot related to service, and a psychosis was not manifested \r\nwithin the first post-service year.\r\n\r\n2.  The veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy.  \r\n\r\n3.  The veteran is not shown to have a diagnosis of PTSD due \r\nto any verified event during his period of military service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nAn acquired psychiatric disability, including PTSD, was not \r\nincurred or aggravated in service, and a psychosis did not \r\nmanifest itself to a compensable degree within one year after \r\nthe date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1112, \r\n1113, 1131 (West 2002 & Supp. 2007); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, \r\n3.304, 3.306, 3.307, 3.309 (2006).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  Duties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), codified \r\nin pertinent part at 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5103, 5103A (West 2002), \r\nand the pertinent implementing regulation, codified at 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.159 (2006), provides that VA will assist a \r\nclaimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate a \r\nclaim but is not required to provide assistance to a claimant \r\nif there is no reasonable possibility that such assistance \r\nwould aid in substantiating the claim.  They also require VA \r\nto notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if \r\nany, of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, not \r\npreviously provided to the Secretary that is necessary to \r\nsubstantiate the claim.  As part of the notice, VA is to \r\nspecifically inform the claimant and the claimant's \r\nrepresentative, if any, of which portion, if any, of the \r\nevidence is to be provided by the claimant and which part, if \r\nany, VA will attempt to obtain on behalf of the claimant.  In \r\naddition, VA must also request that the claimant provide any \r\nevidence in the claimant's possession that pertains to the \r\nclaim.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the veteran was provided with the notice \r\nrequired by the VCAA in July 2003, July 2004, and August 2006 \r\nletters.  Collectively, these letters informed the veteran to \r\nsubmit any pertinent evidence he has in his possession, \r\ninformed him of the evidence required to substantiate the \r\nclaims being decided herein, the information required from \r\nhim to enable VA to obtain evidence on his behalf, the \r\nassistance that VA would provide to obtain evidence on his \r\nbehalf, and that he should submit such evidence or provide VA \r\nwith the information necessary for VA to obtain such evidence \r\non his behalf.  Therefore, the Board finds that he was \r\nprovided with the notice required by the VCAA.\r\n\r\nMoreover, all available evidence pertaining to the veteran's \r\nclaim has been obtained.  The claims folder contains service \r\nmedical records, a hearing transcript, records from the \r\nSocial Security Administration (SSA) and post-service medical \r\nrecords from the VA Medical Center in San Juan, and private \r\nmedical providers.  It appears that all obtainable evidence \r\nidentified by the veteran relative to his service connection \r\nclaim has been obtained and associated with the claims \r\nfolder, and that neither he or his representative has \r\nidentified any other pertinent evidence, not already of \r\nrecord, which would need to be obtained for a fair \r\ndisposition of this appeal.  The Board is also unaware of any \r\nsuch evidence.  Therefore, the Board is satisfied that VA has \r\ncomplied with its duty to assist the veteran in the \r\ndevelopment of the facts pertinent to his service connection \r\nclaim.\r\n\r\nThe record also reflects that the originating agency \r\nreadjudicated the veteran's claim being decided herein \r\nfollowing the provision of the required notice and the \r\ncompletion of all indicated development of the record.  There \r\nis no indication in the record or reason to believe that the \r\nultimate decision of the originating agency on the merits of \r\nthe claim would have been different had complete VCAA notice \r\nbeen provided at an earlier time.\r\n\r\nIn May and August 2006, the RO advised the veteran as to how \r\ndisability ratings and effective dates are assigned, so there \r\ncan be no possibility of any prejudice to the veteran under \r\nthe holding in Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 \r\n(2006).  For the above reasons, it is not prejudicial to the \r\nveteran for the Board to proceed to finally decide the issue \r\ndiscussed in this decision.  See Conway v. Principi, 353 F.3d \r\n1369 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Quartuccio, 16 Vet. App. 183; Sutton \r\nv. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 553 (1996); Bernard v.

Legal Criteria\r\n\r\nFor service connection to be established, there must be a \r\ncurrent disability and evidence that such disability resulted \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 1131 (West 2002 & Supp. 2007); 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.303 (2006).  Regulations also provide that service \r\nconnection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after \r\ndischarge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to \r\nservice, establishes that the disease was incurred in \r\nservice.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d) (2006).\r\n\r\nPsychoses may be presumed to have been incurred during active \r\nmilitary service if they become manifest to a degree of at \r\nleast 10 percent within the first year following active \r\nservice in the case of any veteran who served for 90 day or \r\nmore.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1112 (West 2002 & Supp. 2007); 38 \r\nC.F.R. �� 3.307, 3.309 (2006).\r\n\r\nThere must be medical evidence of a current disability, \r\nmedical or lay evidence of in-service incurrence or \r\naggravation of a disease or injury, and medical evidence \r\nlinking the current disability to that in-service disease or \r\ninjury.  Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341, 346 (1999); Hickson \r\nv. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).\r\n\r\nIt is the responsibility of the Board to review all the \r\nevidence of record and reach a conclusion by applying the \r\nstandard of review set forth above.  The United States Court \r\nof Appeals for the Federal Circuit has recognized the Board's \r\n\"authority to discount the weight and probity of evidence in \r\nlight of its own inherent characteristics and its \r\nrelationship to other items of evidence.\"  Madden v. Gober, \r\n125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  \"It is not error for \r\nthe BVA to favor the opinion of one competent medical expert \r\nover that of another when the Board gives an adequate \r\nstatement of reason or bases.  It is the responsibility of \r\nthe BVA, . . . to assess the credibility and weight to be \r\ngiven to evidence.\"  Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 \r\n(1995).\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.  Analysis\r\n\r\nThe veteran attributes his mental problems to in-service \r\ninjuries that he reportedly sustained when, while on guard \r\nduty in 1985, an explosion occurred and he witnessed some of \r\nhis companions burning.  Since that incident, he reports \r\nexperiencing horrible nightmares and feelings of depression.  \r\n\r\na.  Service Connection Claim for a Psychiatric Disability, \r\nother than PTSD\r\n\r\nOn review, the Board finds that service connection for a \r\npsychiatric disability, other than PTSD, is not warranted.  \r\nIn this regard, while VA medical evidence confirms that the \r\nveteran has a current psychiatric disability, variously \r\ndiagnosed as schizophrenia, depression, a personality \r\ndisorder, and an adjustment disorder, there is no objective \r\nevidence of a psychiatric disability in service.  Service \r\nmedical records are negative for complaints of, treatment \r\nfor, or findings of a psychiatric disability.  A mental \r\nstatus evaluation completed in February 1986 included the \r\nexaminer's determination that no diagnosis was appropriate.  \r\nThe separation examination which was conducted in the \r\nfollowing month also demonstrated that the veteran's \r\npsychiatric system was normal.  At his retirement evaluation, \r\nthe veteran denied ever having experienced frequent trouble \r\nsleeping, depression or excessive worry, loss of memory or \r\namnesia, nervous trouble of any sort, or periods of \r\nunconsciousness.\r\n\r\nThere is also no evidence of a psychosis within the first \r\npost-service year.  The first indication of psychiatric \r\nproblems was in October 1992 when the veteran was initially \r\nadmitted to a VA Medical Center for a non-psychiatric \r\nproblem, but was transferred to the psychiatric unit just \r\nprior to discharge.  \r\n\r\nThere is also no evidence of a nexus between the veteran's \r\ncurrent psychiatric disability and service.  \r\n\r\nThe Board also notes that the veteran's SSA determination \r\nthat the veteran became disabled, in part, due to \r\nschizophrenic, paranoid and other functional psychotic \r\ndisability as of October 8, 1992 does not help the veteran's \r\nservice connection claim as it is based on different \r\nstandards and does not find that the veteran's psychiatric \r\ndisability is related to service.\r\n\r\nAlthough the veteran attributes his current psychiatric \r\ndisability to service, his opinion as to medical matters is \r\nwithout probative value because he, as a layperson, is not \r\ncompetent to establish a medical diagnosis or draw medical \r\nconclusions; such matters require medical expertise.  See \r\nGrottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 (1993); Espiritu v. \r\nDerwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 494-95 (1992).\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Board's July 2006 remand, a VA psychiatric \r\nexamination was scheduled the following month in an effort to \r\nobtain a medical opinion with regard to the etiology of any \r\ncurrent psychiatric disability, other than PTSD.  However, \r\nthe veteran failed to report to such examination.\r\n  \r\nIn sum, while the veteran currently has a psychiatric \r\ndisability, other than PTSD, it has not been linked to an in-\r\nservice event.  Therefore, the claim must be denied.  \r\n\r\n\r\nb.  Service Connection Claim for PTSD\r\n\r\nEstablishing service connection for PTSD currently requires: \r\n(1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD (the provisions of 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 4.125(a) require that a diagnosis of a mental \r\ndisorder conform to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, \r\nFourth Edition (DSM-IV)); (2) credible supporting evidence \r\nthat the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and \r\n(3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology \r\nand the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) \r\n(2006); see Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  \r\n\r\nThe post-service clinical evidence, in pertinent part, \r\nincludes assessments reflecting that the veteran either has \r\nsymptoms of PTSD, or a history of PTSD.  Notwithstanding, \r\nentitlement to service connection for PTSD requires evidence \r\nthat the claimed stressors actually occurred.  With regard to \r\nthe validity of the averred stressor(s), the evidence \r\nnecessary to establish that the claimed stressors actually \r\noccurred varies depending on whether it can be determined \r\nthat the veteran \"engaged in combat with the enemy.\"  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West 2002 & Supp. 2007).  When a veteran \r\nis found to have engaged in combat with the enemy and the \r\nclaimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of \r\nclear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided \r\nthat the claimed stressor is consistent with the \r\ncircumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's \r\nservice, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the \r\noccurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  See 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West 2002 & Supp. 2007); 38 C.F.R. �� \r\n3.304(d), (f) (2006).\r\n\r\nIf the claimant did not engage in combat with the enemy, or \r\nthe claimed stressors are not related to combat, then the \r\nclaimant's testimony alone is not sufficient to establish the \r\noccurrence of the claimed stressors, and his testimony must \r\nbe corroborated by credible supporting evidence.  See Cohen, \r\nsupra.   Service department records must support, and not \r\ncontradict, the claimant's testimony regarding non-combat \r\nstressors.  Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283 (1994).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, it must first be determined if the veteran \r\nengaged in combat with the enemy during his averred \r\nstressors.  VA's General Counsel has defined the ordinary \r\nmeaning of the phrase \"engaged in combat with the enemy\" to \r\nmean that the veteran must have personally participated in a \r\nfight or encounter with a military foe or hostile unit or \r\ninstrumentality.  VAOPGCPREC 12-99 (Oct. 18, 1999).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the veteran's DD-214 shows that he served in \r\nthe Army as an infantryman.  However, his personnel records \r\nfail to show that he received any awards, medals, or \r\ndecorations conclusively indicating combat, therefore, the \r\nBoard finds that the veteran did not engage in combat with \r\nthe enemy.   Thus, the primary issue in this case is whether \r\nthe veteran's reported in-service stressor can be \r\ncorroborated.  (As noted, the veteran attributes his PTSD to \r\nan explosion that reportedly occurred while performing guard \r\nduty in Germany).  This matter is an adjudicatory question \r\ninvolving both consideration of the facts as presented, as \r\nwell as the credibility of the evidence contained in the \r\nclaims folder.  \r\n\r\nOn review, the veteran's claimed stressor has not been \r\nverified.  In this regard, in response to a request by VA, \r\nthe U. S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center \r\n(JSRRC) was unable to verify the veteran's claimed stressor.  \r\nGiven this response, the record does not contain evidence of \r\na verified stressor upon which a diagnosis of PTSD can be \r\nbased.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the evidence does not satisfy the first element \r\nof a successful PTSD claim.  The preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against a finding that the veteran has a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125, and \r\nas such, there is no medical evidence of a link between \r\ncurrent symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  \r\nWhile some treatment records reflect that the veteran has \r\nsymptoms of PTSD or a history of PTSD, there is no diagnosis \r\nof PTSD that has been attributed to inservice stressors.  \r\nWithout a verified stressor, the assessments and history of \r\nPTSD have no probative value.   Medical opinions have no \r\nprobative value when they are based on an inaccurate factual \r\npredicate.  Black v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 177 (1993); Swann v. \r\nBrown, 5 Vet. App. 229 (1993); Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. \r\n548 (1993).  There is no diagnosis of PTSD that is related to \r\nthe veteran's claimed non-combat stressor.  \r\n\r\nAs the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for \r\nservice connection for a psychiatric disability, to include \r\nPTSD, the reasonable doubt doctrine is not for application.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b) (West 2002 & Supp. 2007).  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for a psychiatric \r\ndisability, to include PTSD, is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n___________________________________________\r\nTHOMAS J.

J. Wells-Green, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from July 1970 to August \r\n1971.  \r\n\r\nThis matter came to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on \r\nappeal from a December 1999 rating decision of the Department \r\nof Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Louisville, \r\nKentucky.  In March 2003, December 2004 and March 2006 the \r\nBoard remanded the case for further development.  The \r\nrequested development has been completed and the case has \r\nbeen returned to the Board for further appellate action.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nWhere claims of entitlement to service connection for PTSD \r\nare based on allegations of personal or sexual assault, \r\nevidence from sources other than the veteran's service \r\nrecords may corroborate the veteran's account of the \r\nstressful incident or incidents.  Examples of such evidence \r\ninclude, but are not limited to: Records from law enforcement \r\nauthorities, rape crisis centers, mental health counseling \r\ncenters, hospitals, or physicians; tests for sexually \r\ntransmitted diseases; and statements from family members, \r\nroommates, fellow service members, or clergy.  Evidence of \r\nbehavioral changes following the claimed assault is one type \r\nof relevant evidence that may be found in these sources.  \r\nExamples of behavioral changes that may constitute credible \r\nevidence of a stressor include, but are not limited to: \r\nRequest for transfer to another military duty assignment; \r\ndeterioration in work performance; substance abuse; episodes \r\nof depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an \r\nidentifiable cause; or unexplained economic or social \r\nbehavioral changes.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3)(2006).\r\n\r\nThe veteran's DD Form 214 does not indicate the character of \r\nhis service.  However, a DD Form 215, dated in January 1972, \r\nshows that his DD Form 214 was corrected to reflect service \r\nunder honorable conditions.  The veteran, in written \r\nstatements and in testimony, has indicated that he was \r\ndischarged for either drug abuse or a mental condition \r\ndiagnosed as a personality disorder.  Although these \r\npersonnel records, as well as the veteran's DA Form 20 are of \r\nrecord, it is not clear from the record whether the RO has \r\nattempted to obtain his entire personnel folder, as required \r\nwhen developing a claim for service connection for PTSD based \r\non personal trauma.  See M21-1MR, Part IV, Subpart ii, \r\nChapter 1, Section D, Subsection 17 (December 13, 2005).  The \r\nRO should document its efforts and, if such efforts are \r\nunsuccessful, the RO should so inform the veteran and advise \r\nhim to submit alternate forms of evidence to support his \r\nclaim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Claims for Veterans Appeals \r\n(Court) has stated that \"VA has provided special evidentiary \r\ndevelopment procedures, including the interpretation of \r\nbehavioral changes by a clinician and interpretation in \r\nrelation to a medical diagnosis\" with regard to personal \r\nassault cases.  Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272 (1999) \r\n(citing VA Adjudicatio Procedure Manual M 21-1 Part III, \r\nparagraph 5.14(c)).  \r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that he has PTSD as a result of an in-\r\nservice sexual assault.  Review of the record shows that in \r\nhis July 1970 report of medical history, the veteran had no \r\nrelevant complaints and denied any trouble sleeping, problems \r\nwith nightmares, depression, excessive worry, memory loss or \r\namnesia, bed wetting, nervous trouble, drugs, or excessive \r\ndrinking habits.  His accompanying enlistment medical \r\nexamination report shows that his psychiatric evaluation was \r\nnormal.  His June 1971 report of medical history indicates \r\nthat the veteran experienced depression or excessive worry.  \r\nThe report further notes that his parents had split up and \r\nthat he had inadequate personality development and that he \r\nwas unable to cope with people in the Army.  He worried about \r\npeople harming him, although it was specifically noted that \r\nhe did not worry about physical harm, and that he sometimes \r\nused drugs.  The accompanying separation examination report \r\nshows that a psychiatric evaluation was normal.  However, a \r\nsummary of defects indicates diagnosed dissocial type \r\npersonality disorder.  \r\n\r\nSeveral VA treatment records show the veteran gave histories \r\nof 2 childhood sexual assaults.  The evidence of record \r\nfurther shows the veteran initially gave a history of an in-\r\nservice sexual assault in 2002.  Prior to that time, the \r\nveteran's written statements indicate he was sexually \r\nthreatened, but do not indicate a sexual assault in service.  \r\nAn April 2006 VA psychiatric examination report notes the \r\nveteran's histories of childhood and in-service sexual \r\nassaults and shows a diagnosis of PTSD, which the examiner \r\netiologically links to the veteran's alleged in-service \r\nsexual assault.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should obtain a complete set \r\nof the veteran's personnel records from \r\nthe National Personal Records Center \r\n(NPRC) and associate it with the claims \r\nfiles.\r\n\r\n2.  Thereafter, the RO should arrange for \r\nthe veteran to undergo a VA psychiatric \r\nexamination by a physician with \r\nappropriate expertise to determine the \r\nnature, extent and etiology of the \r\nveteran's PTSD, if found to be present.  \r\nAll indicated studies should be \r\nperformed, to include psychological \r\ntesting if appropriate, and all findings \r\nshould be reported in detail.  The \r\nveteran's claims files, including a copy \r\nof this remand, must be made available to \r\nand reviewed by the examiner.  The \r\nexamination report is to reflect that \r\nsuch a review of the claims files was \r\nmade.  In reviewing the veteran's claims \r\nfiles, the examiner should identify and \r\nexamine all records indicating any change \r\nof behavior or performance subsequent to \r\nthe claimed assault alleged by the \r\nveteran to have occurred during active \r\nservice (to specifically include \r\nconsideration of the June 1971 diagnosis \r\nof a personality disorder), and offer an \r\nopinion as to the clinical significance, \r\nif any, of such evidence to changes.  The \r\nexaminer should then express an opinion \r\nas to whether it is at least as likely as \r\nnot (at least a 50 percent probability) \r\nthat any in-service stressful experience \r\ndescribed by the veteran occurred.  If \r\nthe examiner determines that any claimed \r\nin-service stressful event occurred, he \r\nor she should make a determination as to \r\nwhether the veteran has PTSD as a result \r\nof the stressful event or whether it is a \r\nresult of any other stressful event, to \r\ninclude the veteran's history of sexual \r\nassaults on him during childhood.  A \r\ncomplete rationale must be given for any \r\nopinion expressed, and the foundation for \r\nall conclusions should be clearly set \r\nforth.  If the examiner is unable to give \r\nan opinion without resorting to \r\nspeculation, the report should so state.\r\n\r\nThe veteran is hereby advised that \r\nfailure to report for a scheduled VA \r\nexamination without good cause shown may \r\nhave adverse effects on this claim.\r\n\r\n3.  Thereafter, the RO should \r\nreadjudicate the issue of entitlement to \r\nservice connection for PTSD.  If the \r\nissue on appeal remains denied, a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case should \r\nbe provided to the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative.  After the veteran and \r\nhis representative have had an adequate \r\nopportunity to respond, the appeal should \r\nbe returned to the Board for appellate \r\nreview.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2006).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nKATHLEEN K.

Layton, Law Clerk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant is a veteran who served on active duty from \r\nJuly 1966 to July 1969, including service in the Republic of \r\nVietnam from September 1968 to July 1969.  He also served in \r\nthe Army National Guard from October 1973 to April 1991.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a May 2004 rating decision by the \r\nTogus, Maine, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of \r\nVeterans Affairs (VA).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  All relevant evidence necessary for the equitable \r\ndisposition of the issue on appeal was obtained.\r\n\r\n2.  The evidence of record demonstrates the veteran's \r\npresently diagnosed PTSD is a result of a verified stressor \r\nthat occurred during active service in Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe veteran's presently diagnosed PTSD was incurred during \r\nhis active service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107 (West 2002 & \r\nSupp. 2006); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304(d) (2006).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) describes \r\nVA's duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a \r\nclaim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, \r\n5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2006); 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2006).  In this case, \r\nthe veteran was notified of the VCAA duties to assist and of \r\nthe information and evidence necessary to substantiate his \r\nPTSD claim by correspondence dated in November 2003, February \r\n2004, March 2004 and November 2005.  During the pendency of \r\nthis appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans \r\nClaims (hereinafter \"the Court\") in Dingess/Hartman v. \r\nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006), found that the VCAA \r\nnotice requirements applied to all elements of a claim.  An \r\nadditional notice as to this matter was provided in March \r\n2006.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds the available medical evidence is sufficient \r\nfor adequate determination of the issue addressed in this \r\ndecision.  There has been substantial compliance with all \r\npertinent VA law and regulations.  In light of the favorable \r\ndisposition of this claim, further discussion of the VCAA is \r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nService Connection Claim\r\n\r\nIn general, service connection will be granted for disability \r\nresulting from injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by \r\nactive military service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110 (West Supp. \r\n2006); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (2006).  In order to prevail on the \r\nissue of service connection on the merits, there must be \r\nmedical evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) medical, or \r\nin certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service \r\nincurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) \r\nmedical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service \r\ndisease or injury and the present disease or injury.  Hickson \r\nv. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).  A veteran seeking \r\ndisability benefits must establish the existence of a \r\ndisability and a connection between service and the \r\ndisability.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. \r\n2000).\r\n\r\nIn addition, service connection may be granted for any \r\ndisease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, \r\nincluding that pertinent to service, establishes the disease \r\nwas incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).  For the \r\nshowing of chronic disease in service, there are required a \r\ncombination of manifestations sufficient to identify a \r\ndisease entity, and sufficient observation to establish \r\nchronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated \r\nfindings or a diagnosis including the word chronic.  \r\nContinuity of symptomatology is required only where the \r\ncondition noted during service is not, in fact, shown to be \r\nchronic or when the diagnosis of chronicity may be \r\nlegitimately questioned.  When the fact of chronicity in \r\nservice is not adequately supported, then a showing of \r\ncontinuity after discharge is required to support the claim.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b).\r\n\r\nFor PTSD claims VA law provides that service connection \r\n\"requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in \r\naccordance with � 4.125(a) of this chapter; a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence, between current symptoms and \r\nan in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that \r\nthe claimed in-service stressor occurred. . . .\"  38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.304(f) (2006).  Section 4.125(a) of 38 C.F.R. incorporates \r\nthe 4th edition of the American Psychiatric Association's \r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-\r\nIV) as the governing criteria for diagnosing PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997), the Court held \r\nthat VA had adopted the 4th edition of the DSM-IV and noted \r\nthat the major effect was that the criteria changed from an \r\nobjective \"would evoke ... in almost anyone\" standard in \r\nassessing whether a stressor is sufficient to trigger PTSD to \r\na subjective standard requiring exposure to a traumatic event \r\nand response involving intense fear, helplessness, or horror.  \r\nThe Court further held the sufficiency of a stressor was now \r\na clinical determination for an examining mental health \r\nprofessional.  Id. at 140, 141.\r\n\r\nIn Pentecost v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 124 (2002), the Court \r\nheld that a veteran need not corroborate his actual physical \r\nproximity to (or firsthand experience with) and personal \r\nparticipation in rocket attacks while stationed in Vietnam.  \r\nSee also Suozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307 (1997) (holding \r\nthat \"corroboration of every detail [of a claimed stressor] \r\nincluding the appellant's personal participation\" is not \r\nrequired; rather an appellant only needs to offer independent \r\nevidence of a stressful event that is sufficient to imply his \r\nor her personal exposure).\r\n\r\nThe Court has held that credible supporting evidence of the \r\nactual occurrence of an in-service stressor cannot consist \r\nsolely of after-the-fact medical nexus evidence.  See Moreau \r\nv. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 396 (1996). \r\n\r\nPertinent case law also provides that 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) \r\ndoes not create a presumption of service connection for a \r\ncombat veteran's alleged disability, and that the veteran is \r\nrequired to meet his evidentiary burden as to service \r\nconnection such as whether there is a current disability or \r\nwhether there is a nexus to service which both require \r\ncompetent medical evidence.  See Collette v. Brown, 82 F.3d \r\n389, 392 (1996).\r\n\r\nThe Court has held that where the determinative issue \r\ninvolves medical causation or a medical diagnosis, competent \r\nmedical evidence is required.  Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. \r\nApp. 91 (1993); see also Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. \r\n492 (1992).  The Federal Circuit has also recognized the \r\nBoard's \"authority to discount the weight and probity of \r\nevidence in light of its own inherent characteristics and its \r\nrelationship to other items of evidence.\"  Madden v. Gober, \r\n125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  VA is free to favor \r\none medical opinion over another provided it offers an \r\nadequate basis for doing so.  See Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. \r\n429 (1995).\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of VA to administer the law under a broad \r\ninterpretation, consistent with the facts in each case with \r\nall reasonable doubt to be resolved in favor of the claimant; \r\nhowever, the reasonable doubt rule is not a means for \r\nreconciling actual conflict or a contradiction in the \r\nevidence.  38 C.F.R. � 3.102 (2006).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the veteran's service records show that he \r\nserved in Vietnam with the Headquarters and Headquarters \r\nCompany (HHC) 54th General Support Group.  His military \r\noccupational specialty (MOS) was 94B (cook).  The veteran \r\nstated that in late February 1969 while serving with the HHC \r\nin Nha Trang he was exposed to heavy mortar and rocket fire.  \r\nIn responding to a U. S. Army and Joint Services Records \r\nResearch Center (JSRRC) request, a Defense Personnel Records \r\nImage Retrieval System report states that on February 24, \r\n1969, mortar rounds impacted the area where the HHC was \r\nstationed by Nha Trang and one person was wounded.\r\n\r\nIn a December 2005 statement, a licensed clinical social \r\nworker, R. P., related that that the veteran started therapy \r\nwith him in June 1983.  Mr. P. found that the veteran \r\nsuffered from PTSD secondary to his service in Vietnam.\r\n\r\nIn December 1993, the veteran entered the Southern Maine \r\nMedical Center for psychological treatment.  There, B. B., \r\nD.O., provided diagnoses of  major depression and PTSD.  From \r\nMay to December 1996, the veteran received treatment from M. \r\nH., D.O. for depression and seasonal affective disorder.  \r\nFrom January 2002 to September 2003, C. A. P., D.O.  treated \r\nthe veteran for depression and PTSD.  In October 2003, the \r\nveteran renewed his therapy sessions with Mr. P.\r\n\r\nIn April 2004, the veteran applied for Social Security (SSA) \r\nDisability benefits due to PTSD.  In conjunction with that \r\nclaim, he was examined by J. F. W., Ph.D. in June 2004.  In \r\nhis notes, Dr. W. explained that the veteran had PTSD \r\nsecondary to his military service due to his exposure to \r\ncombat in Vietnam.  SSA benefits were awarded effective from \r\nMarch 2004.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the present claim, a VA examination was \r\nprovided in May 2005.  The psychiatrist reviewed the claims \r\nfile and noted that the veteran claimed multiple PTSD \r\nstressors based on his time in Vietnam.  Of those stressors, \r\nthe psychiatrist specifically mentioned that the verified \r\nmortar fire in Nha Trang on February 24, 1969, would be \r\nenough of a stressor on its own to meet the criteria for a \r\ncredible diagnosis of PTSD.  In a July 2005 addendum, the \r\npsychiatrist reiterated that the single stressor of mortar \r\nfire in Nha Trang would meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe veteran also submitted statements from his sister, his \r\nformer spouse, and his current spouse.  These statements \r\ndiscuss the veteran's behavior and social interactions since \r\nreturning from Vietnam.\r\n\r\nBased upon the evidence of record, the Board finds the \r\nveteran has a present PTSD disability.  The Board finds the \r\nmedical examiner's May 2005 opinion and July 2005 addendum \r\npersuasive.  Those opinions provided the necessary medical \r\nnexus between the veteran's current PTSD and an in-service \r\nstressor.  The veteran's claimed in-service stressor of \r\nrocket fire around Nha Trang was verified by a search of his \r\nunit's records.  Therefore, the claim for entitlement to \r\nservice connection for PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nREN�E M.

VA notified the veteran of the evidence needed to \r\nsubstantiate the claim, explained who was responsible for \r\nsubmitting such evidence, and obtained and fully developed \r\nall other evidence necessary for an equitable disposition of \r\nthe claim.\r\n\r\n2.  The veteran's diagnoses of PTSD and major depressive \r\ndisorder are not based on corroborated non-combat in-service \r\nstressors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nA psychiatric disability, including PTSD and depression, was \r\nnot incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303, 3.304 (2006).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nOn receipt of a complete or substantially complete \r\napplication, VA must notify the claimant and any \r\nrepresentative of any information, medical evidence, or lay \r\nevidence not previously provided to VA that is necessary to \r\nsubstantiate the claim.  This notice requires VA to indicate \r\nwhich portion of that information and evidence is to be \r\nprovided by the claimant and which portion VA will attempt to \r\nobtain on the claimant's behalf.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5103, \r\n5103A, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159 (2006).  The \r\nnotice must: (1) inform the claimant about the information \r\nand evidence not of record that is necessary to substantiate \r\nthe claim; (2) inform the claimant about the information and \r\nevidence that VA will seek to provide; (3) inform the \r\nclaimant about the information and evidence the claimant is \r\nexpected to provide; and (4) request or tell the claimant to \r\nprovide any evidence in the claimant's possession that \r\npertains to the claim, or something to the effect that the \r\nclaimant should \"give us everything you've got pertaining to \r\nyour claim(s).\"  Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, \r\n120-21 (2004).  \r\n\r\nThe RO sent correspondence in May 2002; a rating decision in \r\nApril 2003; a statement of the case in March 2005; and a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case in November 2006.  The May \r\n2002 letter preceded the initial RO adjudication (April \r\n2003), and it essentially complied with VA's notification \r\nduties regarding service connection claims.  The above \r\ndocuments discussed specific types of evidence, the \r\napplicable legal requirements, the evidence considered, the \r\npertinent laws and regulations, and the reasons for the \r\ndecisions.  VA made all efforts to notify and to assist the \r\nappellant with regard to the evidence obtained, the evidence \r\nneeded, the responsibilities of the parties in obtaining the \r\nevidence, and the general notice of the need for any evidence \r\nin the appellant's possession.  The Board finds that even if \r\nthere is any defect with regard to the timing or content of \r\nany notice sent prior to the RO's initial adjudication, that \r\ndefect is harmless because of the thorough and informative \r\nnotices provided throughout the adjudication and because the \r\nappellant has had a meaningful opportunity to participate \r\neffectively in the processing of the claims with an \r\nadjudication by the RO subsequent to receipt of the required \r\nnotice.  VA effectively complied with all of the required \r\nelements under VA's duty to notify claimants prior to the \r\nlast adjudication here (the November 2006 supplemental \r\nstatement of the case).  \r\n\r\nIn March 2006, the RO also advised the veteran of the bases \r\nfor assigning disability ratings and effective dates.  See \r\nDingess/Hartman, supra.  \r\n\r\nIndeed, there has been no prejudice to the appellant in the \r\nessential fairness of the adjudication.  The appellant has \r\nbeen apprised of the need for any evidence in his possession, \r\nand he has not identified any additional evidence that might \r\nbe useful with respect to his claim.  Moreover, any error in \r\nVA's notice to the appellant (which is initially presumed to \r\nbe prejudicial) is in fact harmless.  See Sanders v. \r\nNicholson, 487 F.3d. 881 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (burden is on VA to \r\nshow that error in notice was not prejudicial).  Any \r\ndefective notice has not prejudiced the appellant in the \r\nessential fairness of the adjudication.  See Overton v. \r\nNicholson, 20 Vet. App. 427 (2006); Mayfield v. Nicholson, \r\n19 Vet. App. 103 (2005), rev'd on other grounds, 444 F.3d \r\n1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (specifically declining to address \r\nharmless error doctrine), on remand, 20 Vet. App. 537 (2006) \r\n(discussing Board's ability to consider \"harmless error\"); \r\nsee also Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 \r\n(2006), aff'd in part, Hartman v. Nicholson, 483 F.3d 1311 \r\n(Fed. Cir. 2007), and aff'd, Dingess v. Nicholson, 2007 WL \r\n1686737 (C. A. Fed. Cir. June 5, 2007) (not selected for \r\npublication No. 2006-7247, 2006-7312); cf. Locklear v. \r\nNicholson, 20 Vet. App. 410, 415-16 (2006) (duty to notify \r\ndoes not extend in perpetuity or impose duty on VA to provide \r\nnotice on receipt of every piece of evidence or information).  \r\nVA has informed the veteran of the evidentiary requirements \r\non many instances, and the veteran has expressed an \r\nunderstanding of the evidentiary responsibilities by \r\nnotifying VA of the identify of his medical providers and the \r\ndates of his treatment.  Indeed, alternate sources of \r\nevidence were specifically explored at an August 2005 RO \r\nhearing.  Also, the veteran has expressed an awareness of the \r\nneed for evidentiary corroboration, especially in her \r\nstatements that she has never documented the stressors at \r\nissue here or that she has not told others of those \r\nstressors.  Thus, VA satisfied its duty to notify the \r\nappellant.  \r\n\r\nAlso, VA has obtained all relevant, identified, relevant, and \r\navailable evidence needed for adjudication of the claims and \r\nhas notified the appellant of any evidence that could not be \r\nobtained.  VA has obtained all available records of treatment \r\nfor depression and PTSD.  Counseling treatment records from \r\n1980 and 1981 do not appear to be relevant in a favorable way \r\ninsofar as the other available evidence has described these \r\ncounseling sessions as having arisen from a post-service \r\nstressor.  Thus, VA satisfied both the notice and duty to \r\nassist provisions of the law.  The Board now turns to the \r\nmerits of the claim.\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active \r\nmilitary service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303; see \r\nShedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  \r\nService connection may be granted for disability shown after \r\nservice, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent \r\nto service, shows that it was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.303(d); Cosman v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 303, 305 (1992).\r\n\r\nService connection for a claimed disorder requires (1) \r\nmedical evidence of current disability; (2) medical or, in \r\ncertain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence \r\nor aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical \r\nevidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or \r\ninjury and the current disability. See Shedden v. Principi, \r\n381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Hickson v. West, \r\n12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); see also Degmetich v. Brown, \r\n104 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  This determination is based \r\non analysis of all the evidence of record and evaluation of \r\nits credibility and probative value.  Baldwin v. West, 13 \r\nVet. App. 1, 8 (1999).\r\n\r\nExcept as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the \r\nresponsibility to present and support a claim for benefits \r\nunder laws administered by the Secretary.  The Secretary \r\nshall consider all information and lay and medical evidence \r\nof record in a case before the Secretary with respect to \r\nbenefits under laws administered by the Secretary.  When \r\nthere is an approximate balance of positive and negative \r\nevidence regarding any issue material to the determination of \r\na matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt \r\nto the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107 (West 2002); see Gilbert \r\nv. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990); see also 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.102 (2006).\r\n\r\nThis case involves PTSD, which involves additional \r\nconsiderations.  Service connection for PTSD requires medical \r\nevidence establishing a diagnosis of the condition in \r\naccordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) (i.e., the diagnosis \r\nmust comply with the Fourth Edition of the Diagnostic and \r\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)); credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor \r\nactually occurred; and a link, established by medical \r\nevidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed in-\r\nservice stressor.  38 C.F.R. �� 3.304(f), 4.130; see Cohen v. \r\nBrown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 140 (1997).\r\n\r\nThe evidence to establish the occurrence of a recognizable \r\nstressor during service in support of a PTSD diagnosis will \r\nvary depending upon whether the veteran engaged in \"combat \r\nwith the enemy,\" as established by recognized military \r\ncombat citations or other official records.  If the evidence \r\nestablishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the \r\nenemy, and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, \r\nthe veteran's lay statements alone may establish occurrence \r\nof the claimed in-service stressor, in the absence of clear \r\nand convincing evidence to the contrary, provided that the \r\nclaimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, \r\nconditions, or hardships of the veteran's service.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f); see \r\nZarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 (1993).\r\n\r\nBut in this case, the veteran has not alleged that any of her \r\nstressors are related to any combat service.  \r\n\r\nIf VA determines either that the veteran did not engage in \r\ncombat with the enemy or that the veteran did engage in \r\ncombat, but that the alleged stressor is not combat-related, \r\nthe veteran's lay testimony, by itself, is not sufficient to \r\nestablish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.  Instead, \r\nthe record must contain service records or other probative \r\nevidence supporting his allegations.  Zarycki, 6 Vet. App. at \r\n98.\r\n\r\nWhere the record does not reflect that a claimant engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy under 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b), his or her \r\nassertions, standing alone, cannot as a matter of law provide \r\nevidence to establish that he or she \"engaged in combat with \r\nthe enemy\" or that an event claimed as a stressor occurred.  \r\nDizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163 (1996).  Furthermore, \r\ncredible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service \r\nevent actually occurred cannot be provided by medical opinion \r\nbased on a post-service medical examination.  Moreau v. \r\nBrown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 396 (1996).  This means that \"other \r\ncredible supporting evidence from any source\" must be \r\nprovided. Corroboration of every detail of a claimed \r\nstressor, including the veteran's personal participation, is \r\nnot required; rather, a veteran only needs to offer \r\nindependent evidence of a stressful event that is sufficient \r\nto imply his or her personal exposure.  Pentecost v. \r\nPrincipi, 16 Vet. App. 124 (2002) (quoting Suozzi v. Brown, \r\n10 Vet. App. 307 (1997)).\r\n\r\n\"Credible supporting evidence\" of a non-combat stressor may \r\nbe obtained from service records or other sources, including \r\nlay testimony.  Gaines v. West, 11 Vet. App. 353, 359 (1998).  \r\nFor instance, independent evidence such as radio logs and \r\nmorning reports which establish the occurrence of a stressful \r\nevent and implies a claimant's personal exposure is \r\nsufficient to constitute credible supporting evidence.  \r\nSuozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307 (1997).  But the regulatory \r\nrequirement for \"credible supporting evidence\" means that a \r\nclaimant's testimony, or the medical opinion based upon post-\r\nservice examination, alone cannot establish the occurrence of \r\na non-combat stressor.  Dizoglio, 9 Vet. App. at 166; Moreau, \r\n9 Vet. App. at 396.  \r\n\r\nThis case involves the veteran's allegation that she now has \r\nPTSD and depression that arise from in-service assaults.  In \r\nPatton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272, 280 (1999), the United \r\nStates Court of Veterans Appeals (Court) emphasized that \r\nstatements contained in prior decisions indicating that \r\n\"something more than medical nexus evidence is required to \r\nfulfill the requirement for 'credible supporting evidence'\" \r\nof a claimed stressor and that \"[a]n opinion by a mental \r\nhealth professional based on a post service examination of \r\nthe veteran cannot be used to establish the occurrence of the \r\nstressor,\" were made in the context of discussing PTSD \r\ndiagnoses other than those arising from personal assault.  \r\nSee also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997); Moreau, \r\nsupra.\r\n\r\nIn PTSD cases based on personal assault, several other \r\nconsiderations apply over and above non-sexual trauma/assault \r\nPTSD cases.  Even where official service department records \r\ndo not show that the alleged abuse occurred, given the nature \r\nof this claim, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3), \r\nregarding claims based on personal assault and the method of \r\ndeveloping such cases, are applicable.  In addition to \r\nservice records, alternative evidence must be sought.  \r\nExamples of such evidence include, but are not limited to, \r\nrecords from law enforcement authorities, rape crisis \r\ncenters, mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or \r\nphysicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted \r\ndiseases; and statements from family members, roommates, \r\nfellow service members, or clergy.  Evidence of behavior \r\nchanges after a claimed assault is one type of relevant \r\nevidence that may be found in these sources.  Examples of \r\nbehavior changes that may constitute credible evidence of a \r\nstressor include, but are not limited to, requests for a \r\ntransfer to another military duty assignment; deterioration \r\nin work performance; substance abuse; episodes of depression, \r\npanic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable cause; or \r\nunexplained economic or social behavior changes.  Ibid.\r\n\r\nVA will not deny a PTSD claim based on in-service personal \r\nassault without first advising a claimant that evidence from \r\nsources other than the veteran's service records or evidence \r\nof behavior changes may constitute credible supporting \r\nevidence of the stressor and providing a claimant an \r\nopportunity to furnish this type of evidence or to advise VA \r\nof potential sources of such evidence.  VA may submit any \r\nevidence received to an appropriate medical or mental health \r\nprofessional for an opinion as to whether it indicates that a \r\npersonal assault occurred.  Ibid. \r\n\r\nIn this case, in May 2002, the RO provided the veteran with \r\ninformation relating to her claim, including PTSD based on \r\nassault.\r\n\r\nThe Board is mindful that veterans claiming service \r\nconnection for PTSD due to in-service personal assault face \r\nunique problems documenting their claims.  Since assault is \r\nan extremely personal and sensitive issue, many incidents of \r\npersonal assault are not officially reported, and victims of \r\nthis type of in-service trauma may find it difficult to \r\nproduce evidence to support the occurrence of the stressor.\r\n\r\nAfter all the relevant evidence has been obtained, it is the \r\nBoard's principal responsibility to assess the credibility, \r\nand therefore the probative value of proffered evidence of \r\nrecord in its whole.  Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 \r\n(1995); see Elkins v. Gober, 229 F.3d 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2000); \r\nMadden v. Gober, 125 F. 3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (and \r\ncases cited therein); Guimond v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 69, 72 \r\n(1993); Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 161 (1993).  In \r\ndetermining whether documents submitted by a veteran are \r\ncredible, the Board may consider internal consistency, facial \r\nplausibility, and consistency with other evidence submitted \r\non behalf of the claimant.  Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, \r\n511 (1995).\r\n\r\nThe question of a \"stressor\" also involves credibility \r\ndeterminations, as certain veterans who \"engaged in combat \r\nwith the enemy\" gain evidentiary presumptions. 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.304(d).  There must be credible supporting evidence that a \r\nclaimed in-service stressor actually occurred.  38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.304(f).  The existence of an event alleged as a \r\n\"stressor\" that results in PTSD, though not the adequacy of \r\nthe alleged event to cause PTSD, is an adjudicative, not a \r\nmedical determination.  Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 97-\r\n98 (1993).\r\n\r\nIn evaluating the probative value of competent medical \r\nevidence, the Court has stated, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nThe probative value of medical opinion evidence is \r\nbased on the medical expert's personal examination \r\nof the patient, the physician's knowledge and \r\nskill in analyzing the data, and the medical \r\nconclusion that the physician reaches. . . . As is \r\ntrue with any piece of evidence, the credibility \r\nand weight to be attached to these opinions [are] \r\nwithin the province of the adjudicators; . . .\r\n\r\nGuerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the veteran states that she now suffers from \r\ndepression and PTSD as a result of two sets of in-service \r\nincidents: a sexual assault in April 1971; and a pattern of \r\nsexual harassment by a supervising officer in 1971.  In \r\nconnection with this service connection claim, the veteran \r\nhas described each stressor in detail.\r\n\r\nThe medical evidence reflects several VA hospitalizations for \r\nmajor depressive disorder and for PTSD in 2002 and 2003.  \r\nMost of these hospitalization records have referred to a \r\nbroad variety of stressors, including not only the alleged \r\nin-service sexual assaults and harassment but also non-\r\nservice-related family stressors from childhood, from \r\npossible abuse during childhood, from a divorce, from an \r\nadoption, from current living arrangements, and from economic \r\nand work-related difficulties.  For instance, in February \r\n2002, a treating VA psychiatrist diagnosed PTSD and major \r\ndepressive disorder.  The psychiatrist stated:\r\n\r\nIt is in the setting of some current heightened \r\npsychosocial stressors as well as probably some \r\nchronic developmental issues coming from her \r\nfamily of origin for which she currently is \r\nengaged in the stress of trying to deal with \r\nliving in a dysfunctional setting.  Her [PTSD] is \r\nalso heightened in the setting of these stressors.  \r\nHer [PTSD] from past military sexual assault has \r\nbeen rekindled a bit more over the past year.\r\n\r\nBut earlier psychiatric treatment records uniformly ascribe \r\nthe veteran's psychiatric state to conditions that are not \r\nrelated to her active service.  The veteran was counseled at \r\na non-VA facility between 1980 and 1981.  However, a March \r\n1992 psychosocial evaluation noted that this psychiatric \r\ncounseling had been because she had placed a baby up for \r\nadoption.  There is no indication that this earlier \r\ncounseling was for any in-service trauma.\r\n\r\nThe veteran was also treated in early 1992 at a non-VA \r\nfacility.  Significantly, the records from this psychiatric \r\ntreatment discuss various stressors, such as an unhappy \r\nchildhood, possibly an abusive friend of the family, a baby \r\nthat she put up for adoption, heavy drinking, and post-\r\nservice work-related problems.  However, these psychiatric \r\ntreatment records never mentioned any in-service sexual \r\nassaults or harassment.\r\n\r\nThe veteran has also been an unreliable historian.  For \r\ninstance, on non-VA psychiatric treatment in 1992, she \r\nreported having been fondled and abused by a friend of her \r\nparents.  But on VA treatment in 2002 and 2003, she described \r\nan incident involving exposure or possible sexual abuse by a \r\nbrother-in-law.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, there are significant inconsistencies in the \r\nveteran's description of her in-service stressors.  \r\nInitially, she stated that she was sexually harassed by a \r\nsupervising sergeant in March 1971 and that she was sexually \r\nassaulted by an officer with the Army's Criminal \r\nInvestigative Division in March 1971 as well.  However, she \r\nsubsequently revised her account to indicate that the sexual \r\nassault occurred in April 1971, then to indicate that it \r\ninvolved sexual assault by two men or a gang, and then to \r\nindicate that she was forced to pose against her will for \r\npornographic pictures.  She has also claimed more recently \r\nthat she was in fear from a dispute involving other soldiers \r\nand that she took pills to commit suicide in 1971 because of \r\nher fear.  \r\n\r\nHowever, beyond the inconsistencies, the veteran's claim \r\nultimately suffers because of a lack of corroboration.  She \r\nhas repeatedly remarked that she never documented any of the \r\nincidents and that, for the most part, she had not discussed \r\nany of the in-service incidents with others.  Therefore, \r\nthere is no viable means for corroborating the veteran's \r\naccount of in-service assault and harassment.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the veteran has stated that she sought to be \r\nreassigned, even to Vietnam, because of the sexual \r\nharassment.  However, there is no documentation of her \r\nrequest for reassignment.  She also has indicated that she \r\nhad to seek promotion in service from someone other than the \r\nsupervising sergeant who allegedly harassed her sexually.  \r\nBut her service personnel records actually document three \r\npromotions in a very short period: PV2 E-2 in January 1971; \r\nPFC E3 in April 1971 (that is, around the time of both the \r\nsexual harassment and the sexual assault); and SP4 E4 in \r\nOctober 1971.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran has also descried a suicide attempt by overdose \r\nand being hit in the head by her assailants.  However, as to \r\nthis point, the record is contrary.  A late April 1971 \r\nservice medical record reflects a complaint that the veteran \r\nhad passed out in her barracks after drinking heavily the \r\nnight before.  The veteran apparently reported having had an \r\nepisode of asyncope and having hit the back of her head.  \r\nThere is no mention in this progress note of any overdose on \r\npills or of any behavioral observations suggesting any \r\npsychiatric trauma from the previous day or night.  The Board \r\nis very mindful of the inherent difficulties faced by \r\nindividuals subjected to sexual assault.  However, the \r\nabsence of any evidence or complaint of any psychiatric \r\ntrauma in the April 1971 clinical record undermines the \r\nveteran's account.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the only mention of any emotional difficulties was on \r\nthe veteran's September 1970 entrance examination, where she \r\nnoted having had nightmares, dizzy spells, and headaches, as \r\nwell as insomnia from worry.  She also reported having had \r\nseveral periods of unconsciousness during her childhood.  \r\nOtherwise, there was no mention of any psychiatric or \r\nemotional difficulties during the remainder of the veteran's \r\nactive service or at the time of her separation examination.\r\n\r\nIn short, there is no indication in the service medical \r\nrecords or in any other source that can be used to \r\ncorroborate the veteran's in-service stressors or traumas.  \r\nBecause of the lack of corroboration for these stressors, the \r\nBoard must conclude that the VA psychiatric treatment records \r\ndiagnosing PTSD and depression and ascribing those conditions \r\nto the veteran's in-service stressors are predicated on \r\nunsubstantiated facts.  And as noted above, a claimant's \r\ntestimony or the medical opinion based upon post-service \r\nexamination alone cannot establish the occurrence of a non-\r\ncombat stressor.  Dizoglio, 9 Vet. App. at 166; Moreau, 9 \r\nVet. App. at 396.  \r\n\r\nIn sum, the weight of the evidence indicates that the \r\nveteran's PTSD and depression are not related to any \r\ncorroborated in-service stressors. Since he preponderance of \r\nthe evidence is against the claim, the \"benefit-of-the-\r\ndoubt\" rule does not apply, and he Board must deny the \r\nclaim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, \r\n1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a psychiatric disability, including \r\nPTSD and depression, is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nJohn E.

Lipstein, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from November 1971 until \r\nAugust 1975. \r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\nfrom a September 2003 rating decision of a Department of \r\nVeterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  A notice of \r\ndisagreement was filed in October 2003, a statement of the \r\ncase was issued in November 2004, and a substantive appeal \r\nwas received in January 2005.  The veteran requested a \r\nhearing before the Board and withdrew that request in \r\nSeptember 2006.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1. The veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy, and \r\nhe has not furnished sufficient information regarding claimed \r\nstressors to allow for verification.\r\n\r\n2. Any current PTSD is not related to the veteran's active \r\nduty service. \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated during the veteran's \r\nactive duty service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131, 1154(b), \r\n5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304 (2006).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nOn November 9, 2000, the President signed into law the \r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), which has been \r\ncodified at 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, \r\n5107, 5126; see also 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, and \r\n3.326(a).  Under the VCAA, VA has a duty to notify the \r\nveteran of any information and evidence needed to \r\nsubstantiate and complete a claim, and of what part of that \r\nevidence is to be provided by the claimant and what part VA \r\nwill attempt to obtain for the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1); Quartuccio v. Principi, \r\n16 Vet. App. 183, 187 (2002).  \r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Appeals for Veteran Claims' \r\n(Court's) decision in Pelegrini v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 412 \r\n(2004), held, in part, that a VCAA notice, as required by \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a), must be provided to a claimant before \r\nthe initial unfavorable agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) \r\ndecision on a claim for VA benefits.  This decision has since \r\nbeen replaced by Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 \r\n(2004), in which the Court continued to recognize that \r\ntypically a VCAA notice, as required by 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5103(a), must be provided to a claimant before the initial \r\nunfavorable agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on \r\na claim for VA benefits.  In this case, VA satisfied its \r\nduties to the veteran in a VCAA letter issued in July 2003.  \r\nThe letter predated the September 2003 rating decision.  See \r\nid.  Thereafter, another letter was issued in September 2006.  \r\nCollectively, the VCAA letters notified the veteran of what \r\ninformation and evidence is needed to substantiate his claim \r\nof service connection for PTSD, as well as what information \r\nand evidence must be submitted by the claimant, what \r\ninformation and evidence will be obtained by VA, and the need \r\nfor the claimant to submit any evidence in his possession \r\nthat pertains to the claim.  Id.; but see VA O.G.C. Prec. Op. \r\nNo. 1-2004 (Feb. 24, 2004).  The July and September 2003 \r\nletters have clearly advised the veteran of the evidence \r\nnecessary to substantiate his claim of service connection for \r\nPTSD. \r\n\r\nIn March 2006, the veteran was provided with notice of the \r\ntypes of evidence necessary to establish a disability rating \r\nand the type of evidence necessary to establish an effective \r\ndate.  Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).  \r\nDespite initial inadequate notice provided to the veteran, \r\nthe Board finds no prejudice to him in proceeding with the \r\nissuance of a final decision.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. \r\nApp. 384, 394 (1993) (where the Board addresses a question \r\nthat has not been addressed by the agency of original \r\njurisdiction, the Board must consider whether the appellant \r\nhas been prejudiced thereby).  In any event, since the Board \r\nconcludes below that the preponderance of the evidence is \r\nagainst entitlement to service connection, any questions as \r\nto the appropriate disability rating and effective date to be \r\nassigned are rendered moot. \r\n\r\nThe Board also finds that VA has complied with all assistance \r\nprovisions of VCAA.  The evidence of record contains the \r\nveteran's service medical records and post-service private \r\nmedical records.  There is no indication of relevant, \r\noutstanding records which would support the veteran's claim.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(c); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(1)-(3).  \r\n\r\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Board concludes that VA's \r\nduties to the veteran have been fulfilled with respect to the \r\nissue on appeal.\r\n\r\nCriteria & Analysis\r\n\r\nApplicable law provides that service connection will be \r\ngranted if it is shown that the veteran suffers from \r\ndisability resulting from an injury suffered or disease \r\ncontracted in line of duty, or for aggravation of a \r\npreexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of \r\nduty, in the active military, naval, or air service. 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  That an injury or \r\ndisease occurred in service alone is not enough; there must \r\nbe chronic disability resulting from that injury.  If there \r\nis no showing of a resulting chronic condition during \r\nservice, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after \r\nservice is required to support a finding of chronicity.  38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.303(b).  Service connection may also be granted \r\nfor any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all \r\nthe evidence, including that pertinent to service, \r\nestablishes that the disease or injury was incurred in \r\nservice.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � \r\n4.125(a), a link, established by medical evidence, between \r\ncurrent symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor \r\noccurred.  If the evidence establishes that the veteran \r\nengaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is \r\nrelated to that combat, in the absence of clear and \r\nconvincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the \r\nclaimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, \r\nconditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the \r\nveteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of \r\nthe claimed in-service stressor.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\nThe provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) require that a \r\ndiagnosis of a mental disorder conform to the Diagnostic and \r\nStatistical Manual, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).\r\n\r\nInitially, the Board finds that there is no evidence that the \r\nveteran participated in combat during active service.  With \r\nregard to the question of whether the veteran engaged in \r\ncombat, the phrase \"engaged in combat with the enemy,\" as \r\nused in 38 U.S.C. � 1154(b), requires that a veteran have \r\nparticipated in events constituting an actual fight or \r\nencounter with a military foe or hostile unit or \r\ninstrumentality.  Mere service in a combat area or combat \r\nzone does not in itself lead to the conclusion that an \r\nindividual engaged in combat.  VAOPGCPREC 12-99 (October 18, \r\n1999).  The veteran's DD Form 214 reflects that he served \r\nduring the Vietnam Era; however, he had no foreign and/or sea \r\nservice.  Service personnel records reflect that he served as \r\nan \"Air Trans. Occup.\" in the United States. \r\n\r\nAs it is not shown the veteran engaged in combat, his \r\nunsupported assertions of service stressors are not \r\nsufficient to establish the occurrence of such events.  \r\nBecause the record does not persuasively show participation \r\nin combat, the claimed stressors must be corroborated.  His \r\nalleged service stressors must be established by official \r\nservice records or other credible supporting evidence.  38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.304(f); Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997); \r\nDoran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283 (1994).  The regulatory \r\nrequirement for \"credible supporting evidence\" means that \r\n\"the veteran's testimony, by itself, cannot, as a matter of \r\nlaw, establish the occurrence of a non-combat stressor.\" \r\n Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163 (1996).  \r\n\r\nA June 2003 private medical record from T.W.K., M.D., \r\nreflects that the veteran was treated from February 2001 \r\nthrough March 2001 at an inpatient facility, and sought \r\ntreatment with Dr. K. in June 2003.  The June 2003 record \r\nreflects that the veteran has had continuing emotional health \r\ncare problems.  The veteran has complained of continuing \r\nflashbacks and nightmares of experiences in Vietnam.  He has \r\nbecome very withdrawn, very avoidant, and has multiple \r\nanxiety disorder symptoms including generalized anxiety, \r\npanic, claustrophobia as well as moderate to severe \r\ndepressive symptoms.  He has five to six hours of broken \r\nsleep at night, has trouble maintaining his weight, is sad \r\nall of the time, very withdrawn, has no outside interests and \r\nhas some fleeting thoughts of self harm.  Dr. K. opined that \r\nthere is a background history of PTSD that may be related to \r\nhis development of alcoholism and his continuing \r\nsigns/symptoms of both anxiety and depression when he is not \r\non medication.\r\n\r\nAn August 2003 private medical record from D.L.K., M.D., \r\nstates that the veteran has some PTSD symptoms stemming from \r\na traumatic experience while he was in the service.  Such \r\ntraumatic experience was not recounted by the examiner.  The \r\nveteran reported a 13-year history of depression, anxiety and \r\npanic attacks following a divorce, as well as a very long \r\nhistory of alcohol dependence beginning in the 1970's \r\nstemming from his traumatic experience while he was in the \r\nservice.  The veteran reported that he currently had little \r\ndepression but significant anxiety and frequent panic \r\nattacks.  He was having poor sleep with poor appetite and \r\nweight loss of 30 pounds.  His energy level was fair.  He had \r\nboth withdrawal and anhedonia but had no suicide ideation and \r\nno history of attempts.  The examiner diagnosed major \r\ndepressive disorder, PTSD, and alcohol dependence in \r\nremission.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran was sent a July 2003 letter requesting that he \r\nprovide a detailed description of the specific traumatic \r\nevents causing his PTSD.  In a statement received in August \r\n2003, the veteran claimed that while stationed in Kingsville, \r\nTexas in 1973, he was assigned to crash unit security and \r\nthat he had to clean up crash sites.  He claimed he had to \r\ngather human flesh and body parts at crash site areas and bag \r\nand bring them back for process and burial.  He claimed he \r\nhad to clean up the site following the crash of a good \r\nfriend, Mr. W.  He claimed that he still visualizes Mr. W. \r\nand the other trainees who died in crashes.  He claimed one \r\ncrew member kept a skull and used it as an ashtray.  He \r\nclaimed these experiences led to his increased alcohol \r\nconsumption as self-medication.  He claimed to have severe \r\nfeelings of guilt, nightmares, depression, isolation, and \r\ncontinual reliving of these events.  He did not provide any \r\nfurther information with regard to any claimed stressors.  \r\nMoreover, his service personnel records do not reflect that \r\nhe was assigned to crash unit security.\r\n\r\nBased on the current evidence of claimed stressors submitted \r\nby the veteran, there is insufficient details to allow for \r\ncorroboration.  The September 2003 rating decision indicated \r\nthat more information was needed to verify the alleged \r\nincidents, specifically the full name and rank of Mr. W.  The \r\nNovember 2004 statement of the case, and January 2007 \r\nsupplemental statement of the case also informed the veteran \r\nof what evidence is necessary to establish service connection \r\nfor PTSD.  In addition, the veteran was sent a letter in \r\nSeptember 2006 which requested additional information \r\npertaining to his claimed stressors.  The veteran did not \r\nrespond to any such requests for additional information \r\npertaining to his claimed stressors.  Specifically, although \r\nthe veteran claims that he cleaned up crash sites in 1973, he \r\ndid not provide any detailed information pertaining to the \r\ndate of a specific crash to allow for verification.  \r\nAdditionally, although he claimed that a friend, Mr. W., died \r\nin a crash, he did not provide any other information \r\npertaining to Mr. W., such as his first name, rank, and the \r\ndate or approximate date of such death.  Thus, the veteran's \r\nstatements do not provide specific details of claimed \r\nstressors that could be corroborated.  The Board acknowledges \r\nthe veteran's statements that he had traumatic experiences in \r\nservice; nevertheless, the veteran has failed to provide the \r\nnecessary specifics of stressor information to confirm the \r\nstressor.\r\n\r\nThus, the veteran has not furnished any details of alleged \r\nstressors to allow for an attempt to verify such claimed \r\nstressors.  The Board acknowledges that the veteran has not \r\nbeen afforded a VA examination to assess whether he has PTSD, \r\nhowever, assuming for the sake of argument that a diagnosis \r\nof PTSD was rendered, his claim would still fail since there \r\nis no competent evidence that any PTSD is related to a \r\nverified stressor.  A diagnosis of PTSD which is based on an \r\nexamination which relied upon an unverified history is \r\ninadequate.  See West v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 70, 77-78 \r\n(1994).  Thus, affording the veteran a VA examination to \r\nassess whether he has PTSD would prove futile.  Service \r\nconnection for PTSD must be denied as there is no evidence \r\nthat any current PTSD that he may suffer from is related to \r\nany stressors that occurred during his active duty service.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there is no evidence that the veteran engaged \r\nin combat and the only evidence of in-service stressors are \r\ncontained in the veteran's uncorroborated statements, and \r\nprivate medical records based on the veteran's uncorroborated \r\nstatements.  Thus, there is no probative evidence that the \r\nclaimed in-service stressors actually occurred.  \r\nConsequently, absent probative supporting evidence, an \r\nessential element for a grant of service connection for PTSD \r\nis not established.  \r\n\r\nIn view of the foregoing, because there is no credible \r\nsupporting evidence of an in-service stressor, the Board \r\nconcludes that the preponderance of the evidence is against \r\nthe veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD.  The benefit sought on appeal must, accordingly, be \r\ndenied.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied. \r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nWAYNE M.

Osborne, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from May 1952 to April 1954.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal of a July 2003 rating decision issued by \r\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) \r\nin Cleveland, Ohio, that denied the veteran's claim for \r\nservice connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  \r\nThis decision was issued to the veteran and his service \r\nrepresentative in August 2003.  He disagreed with this \r\ndecision in April 2004.  When he perfected a timely appeal in \r\nJuly 2004, the veteran also requested a Travel Board hearing.  \r\nThis hearing was held before the undersigned Acting Veterans \r\nLaw Judge at the RO in March 2007.\r\n\r\nIn June 2006, the veteran notified VA that he had moved to \r\nthe jurisdiction of the RO in Waco, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\nThere is no competent diagnosis of PTSD based on a verifiable \r\nin-service stressor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred during active service.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n�� 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, \r\n3.159, 3.303, 3.304 (2007).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nDuties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete \r\napplication, VA must notify the claimant of the information \r\nand evidence not of record that is necessary to substantiate \r\na claim, which information and evidence VA will obtain, and \r\nwhich information and evidence the claimant is expected to \r\nprovide.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a).  VA must request that the \r\nclaimant provide any evidence in the claimant's possession \r\nthat pertains to a claim. 38 C.F.R. � 3.159.\r\n\r\nThe notice requirements apply to all five elements of a \r\nservice connection claim: 1) veteran status; 2) existence of \r\na disability; (3) a connection between the veteran's service \r\nand the disability; 4) degree of disability; and 5) effective \r\ndate of the disability.  Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. \r\n473 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe notice must be provided to a claimant before the initial \r\nunfavorable adjudication by the RO.  Pelegrini v. Principi, \r\n18 Vet. App.112 (2004).\r\n\r\nThe notice requirements may be satisfied if any errors in the \r\ntiming or content of such notice are not prejudicial to the \r\nclaimant.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 103 (2005), \r\nrev'd on other grounds, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  \r\n\r\nThe RO provided the appellant pre-adjudication notice by \r\nletter dated in July 2002 and additional notice in April \r\n2004, subsequent to the initial adjudication.  The claimant \r\nhas had the opportunity to submit additional argument and \r\nevidence, and to meaningfully participate in the adjudication \r\nprocess.  The claim was subsequently readjudicated in a July \r\n2004 and February 2005 supplemental statements of the case, \r\nfollowing the provision of notice.  The veteran has not \r\nalleged any prejudice as a result of the untimely \r\nnotification, nor has any been shown.  \r\n\r\nThe notification substantially complied with the requirements \r\nof Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002), \r\nidentifying the evidence necessary to substantiate a claim \r\nand the relative duties of VA and the claimant to obtain \r\nevidence, and Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004), \r\nrequesting the claimant to provide evidence in his or her \r\npossession that pertains to the claim.  \r\n\r\nWhile the notification did not advise the veteran of the laws \r\nregarding degrees of disability or effective dates for any \r\ngrant of service connection, no new disability rating or \r\neffective date for award of benefits will be assigned as the \r\nclaim for service connection was denied.  Accordingly, any \r\ndefect with respect to that aspect of the notice requirement \r\nis rendered moot.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 394 \r\n(1993); see also Dingess, supra.  \r\n\r\nVA has obtained service medical records, assisted the veteran \r\nin obtaining evidence, afforded the veteran a physical \r\nexamination, obtained a medical opinion as to the etiology of \r\nthe claimed disability, and afforded the veteran the \r\nopportunity to give testimony before the Board.  All known \r\nand available records relevant to the issues on appeal have \r\nbeen obtained and associated with the veteran's claims file; \r\nthe veteran has not contended otherwise.  \r\n\r\nThe RO also has made repeated attempts to obtain the \r\nveteran's service personnel records in order to attempt \r\nverification of the veteran's claimed in-service stressors.  \r\nIn November 2002, the National Personnel Records Center \r\n(NPRC) notified VA that, after conducting an extensive and \r\nthorough search, it had determined that the veteran's service \r\npersonnel records either did not exist, NPRC did not have \r\nthem, or that further efforts to locate the veteran's service \r\npersonnel records at NPRC would be futile.  \r\n\r\nVA has substantially complied with the notice and assistance \r\nrequirements and the veteran is not prejudiced by a decision \r\non the claim at this time.\r\n\r\nService Connection for PTSD\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that he incurred PTSD as a result of \r\nactive combat service in Korea.  He has identified his \r\nclaimed in-service stressors as shooting a Korean girl while \r\non patrol during active combat service in Korea and seeing \r\nfellow service members killed when a jeep he was in ran over \r\na landmine during active combat service in Korea.  According \r\nto the veteran's testimony, these events occurred in 1952 or \r\n1953.\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted if the evidence \r\ndemonstrates that a current disability resulted from an \r\ninjury or disease incurred or aggravated in active military \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).  \r\nEstablishing service connection generally requires (1) \r\nmedical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in \r\ncertain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service occurrence \r\nor aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical \r\nevidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or \r\ninjury and the present disability.  Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. \r\nApp. 247, 253 (1999).\r\n\r\nIf there is no evidence of a chronic condition during service \r\nor an applicable presumptive period, then a showing of \r\ncontinuity of symptomatology after service may serve as an \r\nalternative method of establishing the second and/or third \r\nelement of a service connection claim.  See 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.303(b); Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488 (1997).  \r\nContinuity of symptomatology may be established if a claimant \r\ncan demonstrate (1) that a condition was \"noted\" during \r\nservice; (2) evidence of post-service continuity of the same \r\nsymptomatology\" and (3) medical or, in certain \r\ncircumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present \r\ndisability and the post-service symptomatology.  Evidence of \r\na chronic condition must be medical, unless it relates to a \r\ncondition to which lay observation is competent.  If service \r\nconnection is established by continuity of symptomatology, \r\nthere must be medical evidence that relates a current \r\ncondition to that symptomatology.  See Savage, 10 Vet. \r\nApp. at 495-498.\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with VA regulations; a \r\nlink, established by medical evidence, between current \r\nsymptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting \r\nevidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran's service medical records show no complaints of \r\nor treatment for PTSD or for injuries that may have been \r\nsustained in a jeep accident.  The report of an April 1954 \r\nseparation examination noted no pertinent defects, diagnoses \r\nor significant interval history.  As noted previously, the \r\nveteran's service personnel records are not available for \r\nreview.  The veteran's DD 214 is of record, but does not show \r\nthat he received any medals or decorations indicative of \r\ncombat service.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran provided information when he filed his claim for \r\nservice connection for PTSD in July 2002 that he was assigned \r\nto the 4.2 Mortar Company, Ninth Marine Regiment.  This \r\ninformation also shows that the Executive Officer for this \r\nunit was First Lt. Edward Z. Grabowski, the service member \r\nwhom the veteran alleges died when the jeep that they were in \r\nran over a landmine.  A review of information obtained by the \r\nRO in October 2002 on the Ninth Marine Regiment shows that \r\nthis regiment included the 4.2 Mortar Company.  The detailed \r\nhistory of that organization does not show that it was \r\ninvolved in combat during the veteran's time on active duty.   \r\n\r\nThe RO sent the veteran a PTSD Questionnaire in July 2002; \r\nthis document was never returned.  \r\n\r\nVA clinical records show that, on PTSD examination in \r\nNovember 2002, the veteran reported being on active combat \r\nduty for 9 months in Korea with the Ninth Marine Regiment, \r\nFirst Marine Division.  While driving in a jeep, it struck a \r\nmine, killing a lieutenant and the driver who were in the \r\njeep with the veteran.  The veteran was spared from injury.  \r\nThe veteran also reported that, after having been warned \r\nabout Korean civilians arming themselves with hand grenades \r\nto kill American soldiers, he shot a Korean girl whom he \r\nthought was carrying explosives.  The VA examiner stated, \"I \r\ncannot confirm the specific events of the combat, but his \r\nhistory is believable.\"  The veteran denied any nightmares \r\nor distressing dreams, although he experienced daily \r\nintrusive thoughts of his combat duty in Korea.  He also had \r\ninfrequent flashbacks.  He denied any psychiatric treatment.  \r\nMental status examination of the veteran showed normal \r\nspeech, no delusions, hallucinations, grandiosity, or \r\nparanoia, logical thought processes, full orientation, and an \r\nintact memory.  The veteran's Global Assessment of \r\nFunctioning (GAF) score was 60.  The VA examiner commented, \r\n\"Although I was not able to document from the claims file \r\nevidence to confirm he served in the combat as he reports, \r\nhis reporting of that history appears valid.\"  The diagnosis \r\nwas chronic PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe veteran is competent to testify on factual matters of \r\nwhich he has first-hand knowledge.  Washington v. Nicholson, \r\n19 Vet. App. 362 (2005).\r\n\r\nIn January 2003, the United States Marine Corps (USMC) \r\nHeadquarters notified the RO that no records were available \r\nfor the veteran's unit of assignment for 1952 and 1953.  In \r\nJuly 2003, NPRC notified the RO that it was unable to verify \r\nthat the veteran's claimed in-service stressor of a jeep \r\nstriking a landmine and killing a first lieutenant had, in \r\nfact, occurred.  And, as the veteran conceded in his March \r\n2007 Travel Board hearing testimony, he is unable to provide \r\nsufficient additional details (dates and locations of \r\nincidents, units of assignment at time of incidents) to \r\nrender his other claimed in-service stressor (killing a \r\nKorean girl) capable of verification by the Joint Services \r\nRecords Research Center (JSRRC) (formerly the Center for Unit \r\nRecords Research (CURR)) or USMC Headquarters.  \r\n\r\nA January 2005 Report of Contact associated with the claims \r\nfolder details a conversation between the veteran and RO \r\npersonnel as a follow-up to an earlier conversation about the \r\nveteran's attempts to obtain additional information to \r\ncorroborate his claimed stressors.  It was noted that the \r\ninformation the veteran had provided about the jeep accident \r\nwas based on what people had told him because the veteran \r\nhimself was in a coma for three days after the accident and \r\ndid not recall the date of the accident.  \r\n\r\nThere is a diagnosis of PTSD of record and thus, the central \r\nissue in this case is whether the record contains credible \r\nsupporting evidence that a claimed in-service stressor \r\nactually occurred which supports the diagnosis.  The evidence \r\nnecessary to establish the occurrence of a stressor during \r\nservice varies depending on whether the veteran was \"engaged \r\nin combat with the enemy.\"  Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60 \r\n(1993).  If it is shown through military citation or other \r\nappropriate evidence that a veteran engaged in combat with \r\nthe enemy, and the claimed stressors are related to combat, \r\nthe veteran's lay testimony regarding the reported stressors \r\nmust be accepted as conclusive evidence of their actual \r\noccurrence, provided the testimony is found to be \r\nsatisfactory, e.g., credible and \"consistent with the \r\ncircumstances, conditions, or hardships of such service.\"  \r\nIn such cases, no further developmental or corroborative \r\nevidence is necessary.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.304(d).\r\n\r\nIn this case, no competent evidence shows that the veteran \r\nengaged in combat with an enemy force.  Although service \r\npersonnel records are unavailable, the DD Form 214 does not \r\nshow that the veteran received any award associated with \r\nvalor or heroism shown while engaged with an enemy force.  In \r\nsuch cases, the record must contain other corroborative \r\nevidence that substantiates or verifies the veteran's \r\nstatements as to the occurrence of the claimed stressors.  \r\nSee West (Carlton) v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 70 (1994); Zarycki \r\nv. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91 (1993).\r\n\r\nHowever, no in-service stressor has been verified because the \r\nveteran has failed to provide enough details concerning his \r\nalleged stressors.  Despite repeated attempts to verify the \r\nveteran's claimed in-service stressors based on the limited \r\ninformation that he provided to VA, they could not be \r\nverified.  After reviewing the record, the Board finds that \r\nthe veteran has not provided credible supporting evidence \r\nthat a claimed in-service stressor actually occurred.  \r\nAlthough the veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD, the Board \r\nfinds no credible evidence which verifies any of his claimed \r\nstressors.\r\n\r\nThe veteran has not submitted any evidence such as lay \r\nstatements from other soldiers to verify any of his \r\nstressors.  Moreover, verification of the veteran's claimed \r\nstressors is not possible based on the nature of the \r\nstressors and the lack of details provided.  For instance, \r\nwith regard to the claimed jeep accident, the veteran told RO \r\npersonnel that any information he gave as to that incident \r\nwas based on what others told him because he had been in a \r\ncoma at the time.  As noted, service medical records do not \r\nbear that out.  Although there is evidence that the person \r\nidentified by the veteran as having been killed in that \r\naccident was in fact killed in 1953, there is no indication \r\nthat the veteran was present for that event.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a medical opinion diagnosing PTSD does not suffice \r\nto verify the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressors.  \r\nCohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  Wilson v. \r\nDerwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614 (1992).  The Board is not required \r\nto accept an appellant's uncorroborated account of his active \r\nservice experiences.  See Swann v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 229 \r\n(1993). \r\n\r\nIn this case, the Board finds that the veteran's stressors do \r\nnot provide a basis to grant service connection for PTSD.  \r\nThe veteran's statements do not provide a basis to obtain \r\nmore information regarding the alleged stressors or provide a \r\nbasis to grant PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThus, as the veteran has failed to produce credible \r\nsupporting evidence that a claimed in-service stressor \r\nactually occurred, the Board finds that the preponderance of \r\nthe evidence is against the claim of entitlement to service \r\nconnection for PTSD.  Hence, the appeal is denied. \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress \r\ndisorder (PTSD) is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nM.

Kordich, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from April 1971 to November \r\n1972.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a May 2004 rating decision by the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nBoston, Massachusetts, which denied the benefit sought on \r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran claims that entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD due to an in-service assault.  In this regard, VA has \r\nestablished special evidentiary development procedures, \r\nincluding the interpretation of behavioral changes by a \r\nclinician and interpretation in relation to a medical \r\ndiagnosis.  Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272 (1999)\r\n\r\nSignificantly, the record shows the veteran has not been \r\nprovided with specific notice of certain provisions that \r\napply to cases involving PTSD based on allegations of \r\npersonal assault.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (3) (2006).  VA will \r\nnot deny a PTSD claim that is based on an inservice personal \r\nassault without first advising the claimant that evidence \r\nfrom sources other than the veteran's service records or \r\nevidence of behavioral changes may constitute credible \r\nsupporting evidence of the stressor, further development is \r\nin order.\r\n\r\nFurther, the veteran's case would be stronger if he provided \r\nadditional details concerning the claimed assault which would \r\nindependently verify the claimed in-service stressor.  In \r\nthis regard, he should attempt to inform VA when the incident \r\noccurred, or at a minimum give VA a sixty day window; the \r\nnames of any investigating military police personnel; and the \r\nname of the alleged attacker, etc.  Further, he should \r\nidentify any independent source which would independently \r\ncorroborate the claimed stressor.\r\n\r\nIn view of the foregoing, the case is REMANDED for the \r\nfollowing actions:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should contact the veteran and \r\nnotify him of the opportunity to furnish, \r\nor to advise VA of the potential source \r\nor sources of evidence other than his \r\nservice records, or evidence of \r\nbehavioral changes, that might constitute \r\ncredible supporting evidence of his \r\npurported inservice stressor.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304.  The veteran must be provided \r\nwith specific examples of corroborating \r\nalternative evidence.\r\n\r\n2.  The veteran is to be invited to \r\nsubmit a statement providing greater \r\ndetail concerning the claimed inservice \r\nstressor.  In particular he should \r\nidentify when the event occurred; the \r\nnames of any law enforcement personnel \r\nwho investigated the incident; the name \r\nof the hospital he was admitted to due \r\nafter the assault; and any mental health \r\ncenter reports he has not previously \r\nidentified.  \r\n\r\n3.  The RO should review all the evidence \r\nof record.  \r\n\r\n4.  If and only if, an in-service \r\nstressor is independently verified, the \r\nRO should schedule the veteran for a \r\npsychiatric examination to determine the \r\nnature and etiology of any current PTSD.  \r\nThe claims folder must be made available \r\nto the examiner for review.  The clinical \r\nhistory and all pertinent psychiatric \r\npathology should be discussed in the \r\nexamination report.  If PTSD is \r\ndiagnosed, the examiner should specify \r\nwhich stressor was used as a basis for \r\nthe diagnosis, and the evidence which \r\nindependently verifies the claimed \r\nstressor.  The examiner should then opine \r\nwhether it is at least as likely as not \r\nthat PTSD had its onset during the \r\nveteran's active service.\r\n\r\n5.  Thereafter, the RO must review the \r\nclaims folder and ensure that the \r\nforegoing development actions, as well as \r\nany other necessary development has been \r\nconducted and completed in full.  The RO \r\nshould review any examination report to \r\nensure that it is in complete compliance \r\nwith the directives of this REMAND.  If \r\nthe report is deficient in any manner, \r\nthe RO must implement corrective \r\nprocedures at once.\r\n\r\n6.  The RO should then readjudicate the \r\nissue on appeal.  If the benefit sought \r\non appeal is not granted to the veteran's \r\nsatisfaction, the RO must issue a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case, and \r\nprovide him with an opportunity to \r\nrespond.  The RO is advised that they are \r\nto make a determination based on the law \r\nand regulations in effect at the time of \r\ntheir decision, to include any further \r\nchanges in VCAA and any other applicable \r\nlegal precedent.\r\n\r\nAfter the veteran has been given an opportunity to respond to \r\nthe supplemental statement of the case and the period for \r\nsubmission of additional information or evidence set forth in \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(b) (West 2002) has expired, if applicable, \r\nthe case should be returned to the Board for further \r\nappellate consideration, if otherwise in order. \r\n\r\nBy this remand, the Board intimates no opinion as to any \r\nfinal outcome warranted. No action is required of the veteran \r\nuntil he is notified by the RO. The veteran has the right to \r\nsubmit additional evidence and argument on the matter the \r\nBoard has remanded to the RO.

Gervasio, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from December 1942 to \r\nDecember 1945.  He served in Combat in the Pacific during \r\nWorld War II, and has been awarded a Purple Heart Medal.\r\n\r\nThis case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on \r\nappeal of a rating decision of the Manchester, New Hampshire, \r\nRegional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs \r\n(VA).  \r\n\r\nA motion to advance the case on the Board's docket has been \r\ngranted.  \r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD was initially denied by rating \r\ndecision dated in June 2002.  The veteran did not appeal this \r\ndenial.  Correspondence received in August 2003 is considered \r\nto be an application to reopen his claim for service \r\nconnection.  In support of this application, a statement was \r\nreceived from a private physician, which included a diagnosis \r\nof PTSD.  This has been taken as new evidence sufficient to \r\nreopen the claim.  Justus v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 510, 513 \r\n(1992).  Therefore, the Board will review the claim de novo.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of PTSD as a result of service has not been \r\nclinically confirmed in the record.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was neither incurred in nor aggravated by service. \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 \r\n(2007).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Board must first address the provisions of the Veterans \r\nClaims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA).  38 U.S.C.A. � 5100 et \r\nseq. (West 2002); see 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, \r\n3.326(a).  The law addresses the notification and assistance \r\nrequirements of VA in the context of claims for benefits.  \r\n\r\nIn this regard, the Court has held that a notice, as required \r\nby 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a), must be provided to a claimant \r\nbefore the initial unfavorable agency of original \r\njurisdiction (AOJ) decision on a claim for VA benefits.  \r\nPelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004).  In addition, \r\nthe Court held that a notice consistent with 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) must accomplish the \r\nfollowing: (1) inform the claimant about the information and \r\nevidence not of record that is necessary to substantiate the \r\nclaim; (2) inform the claimant about the information and \r\nevidence that VA will seek to provide; (3) inform the \r\nclaimant about the information and evidence the claimant is \r\nexpected to provide; and (4) request or tell the claimant to \r\nprovide any evidence in the claimant's possession that \r\npertains to the claim, or something to the effect that the \r\nclaimant should \"give us everything you've got pertaining to \r\nyour claim(s).\"  Id.\r\n\r\nIn a VCAA letter dated in October 2003, the RO notified the \r\nappellant of the information and evidence necessary to \r\nsubstantiate the claim, the information and evidence that VA \r\nwould seek to provide, and the information and evidence the \r\nappellant was expected to provide.  In addition, the RO asked \r\nthe appellant to submit any evidence in his possession that \r\npertains to the claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) (West \r\n2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) (2003); Quartuccio v. Principi, \r\n16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  This letter also provided \r\nsufficient notice as to what is needed in terms of new and \r\nmaterial evidence so as to satisfy the notice provisions of \r\nKent.  See Kent v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 1 (2006).  \r\n\r\nDuring the pendency of this appeal, on March 3, 2006, the \r\nUnited States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) \r\nissued a decision in the consolidated appeal of Dingess v. \r\nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006), which held that the VCAA \r\nnotice requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.159(b) apply to all five elements of a service connection \r\nclaim.  Those five elements include:  1) veteran status; 2) \r\nexistence of a disability; 3) a connection between the \r\nveteran's service and the disability; 4) degree of \r\ndisability; and 5) effective date of the disability.  The \r\nCourt held that upon receipt of an application for a service-\r\nconnection claim, 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.159(b) require VA to review the information and the \r\nevidence presented with the claim and to provide the claimant \r\nwith notice of what information and evidence not previously \r\nprovided, if any, will assist in substantiating or is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the elements of the claim as \r\nreasonably contemplated by the application.  Id.  \r\nAdditionally, this notice must include notice that a \r\ndisability rating and an effective date for the award of \r\nbenefits will be assigned if service connection is awarded.  \r\nId.  \r\n\r\nIn the present appeal, the veteran was provided with notice \r\nof what type of information and evidence was needed to \r\nsubstantiate his claim for service connection, but he/she was \r\nnot provided with notice of the type of evidence necessary to \r\nestablish a disability rating or effective date for the \r\ndisability on appeal.  Despite the inadequate notice provided \r\nto the veteran on these latter two elements, the Board finds \r\nno prejudice to the veteran in proceeding with the issuance \r\nof a final decision.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, \r\n394 (1993) (where the Board addresses a question that has not \r\nbeen addressed by the agency of original jurisdiction, the \r\nBoard must consider whether the veteran has been prejudiced \r\nthereby).  In that regard, as the Board concludes below that \r\nthe preponderance of the evidence is against the appellant's \r\nclaim(s) for service connection, any questions as to the \r\nappropriate disability rating or effective date to be \r\nassigned are rendered moot.  \r\n\r\nIn order to establish service connection for a claimed \r\ndisability, the facts, as shown by the evidence, must \r\ndemonstrate that a particular disease or injury resulting in \r\ncurrent disability was incurred during active service or, if \r\npreexisting active service, was aggravated therein.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131.  If a condition noted during \r\nservice is not shown to be chronic, then generally, a showing \r\nof continuity of symptoms after service is required for \r\nservice connection.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b).  \r\n\r\nService connection for post-traumatic stress disorder \r\nrequires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in \r\naccordance with Sec. 4.125(a) of this chapter; a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence, between current symptoms and \r\nan in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that \r\nthe claimed in-service stressor occurred.  If the evidence \r\nestablishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy \r\nand the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the \r\nabsence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and \r\nprovided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the \r\ncircumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's \r\nservice, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the \r\noccurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  If the \r\nevidence establishes that the veteran was a prisoner-of-war \r\nunder the provisions of Sec. 3.1(y) of this part and the \r\nclaimed stressor is related to that prisoner-of-war \r\nexperience, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence \r\nto the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is \r\nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone \r\nmay establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service \r\nstressor. 38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (f).\r\n\r\nThe veteran is claiming service connection for PTSD as a \r\nresult of service during World War II.  The record shows that \r\nthe veteran served in combat on several islands in the \r\nPacific, any one of which would meet the stressor criterion \r\nto support a diagnosis of PTSD.  The Board has reviewed the \r\nrecord, including service medical records, medical records \r\nfrom the 1950's and 1960's and more recent records that are \r\nrelated to the current claim on appeal.  After consideration \r\nof this evidence, the Board has come to the conclusion that \r\nthe record does not support the establishment of service \r\nconnection for PTSD.  In this regard, it is noted that the \r\nmedical records from service and from the years soon after \r\nthe veteran's discharge from service do not show evidence of \r\nan acquired psychiatric disorder, but of epilepsy and of a \r\npersonality disorder.  More recent medical evidence includes \r\nevaluations that support the diagnosis of PTSD and \r\nevaluations that indicate that the diagnosis of PTSD is not \r\nsupported by the evidence.  For the foregoing reasons, the \r\nBoard finds the evaluations that do not support the diagnosis \r\nto be more persuasive such that service connection is not \r\nwarranted.  \r\n\r\nThe evaluations that support a PTSD diagnosis consist of a \r\nstatement from a Vet Center, dated in November 2001, and a \r\nstatement from the veteran's private physician, dated in \r\nOctober 2003.  The November 2001 statement indicates that the \r\nsymptoms of PTSD that support the diagnosis of PTSD are an \r\nexaggerated startle response and frequent intrusive thoughts \r\nof the war.  The October 2003 statement reviewed symptoms \r\nthat included memories of the death of friends in combat, \r\nnightmares, flashbacks, and being easily angered.  He further \r\nstated that he was restless and was described as having a \r\nsomatic form of anxiety related to body movements.  The \r\ndiagnosis was PTSD, chronic and severe.  \r\n\r\nVA compensation examinations for the purpose of determining \r\nif the veteran might be diagnosed as having PTSD were \r\nconducted in April 2002, November 2003 and July 2004.  The \r\nfirst two examinations were performed by the same examiner, \r\nwho indicated that the veteran did not meet all the criteria \r\nto support a diagnosis of PTSD.  Specifically, the veteran \r\nmet the criteria of being exposed to traumatic events and \r\nthat he reexperienced these events persistently.  He did not, \r\nhowever, meet the remaining criteria regarding the need to \r\navoid thoughts or feelings associated with the trauma and \r\nsymptoms of increased arousal.  As such, the evidence does \r\nnot support the diagnosis of PTSD.  The examination that was \r\nconducted in July 2004 was even more specific and detailed \r\nregarding the assessment that the veteran did not meet the \r\nspecific DSM IV TR criteria for PTSD.  The examiner specified \r\nthat the veteran met only the first criterion, that of being \r\ninvolved in traumatic events, but no other.  It was \r\nspecifically stated that the veteran did not meet the \r\ncriteria of reexperiencing symptoms; avoidance of thinking, \r\nfeeling, or talking about the traumatic war experiences; and \r\ndescribed only minimal irritability, difficulty \r\nconcentrating, hypervigilance, or other persistent symptoms \r\nof increased arousal.  The remaining criteria were not \r\nrelevant because they depended on the other criteria having \r\nbeen met.  The examiner summarized that although the veteran \r\ndid suffer traumatic events during service and had a few \r\nsymptoms that were likely caused by those experiences, the \r\nnumber of symptoms and degree of distress did not rise to a \r\nlevel of a diagnosis of PTSD.  Additionally, the veteran did \r\nnot have a disturbance in his functioning to merit this \r\ndiagnosis.  It was noted that the problems that the veteran \r\nencountered during the 1950's and 1960's appeared to be \r\nrelated to factors other than PTSD.  \r\n\r\nAs noted, the Board finds that the three VA compensation \r\nexaminations to be more persuasive than the two reports that \r\nindicated that the veteran currently has PTSD.  The \r\ncompensation examinations are found to be more complete and \r\ndetailed in evaluating the veteran's symptoms and \r\nspecifically what is not found to support the diagnosis.  It \r\nis important to note that all the examinations detail similar \r\nsymptoms, but it is the interpretation of those symptoms, \r\nspecifically as they regard the diagnosis of PTSD, where the \r\ndifferences occur.  It is the completeness of the VA \r\ncompensation examinations as opposed to the Vet Center and \r\nstatement from the private physician that the Board finds \r\npersuasive.  As such, the Board is not able to find that a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD has been confirmed.  As such, service \r\nconnection is not found to be warranted.  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is denied.  \r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nMICHAEL D.

This matter comes before the Board \r\nof Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2002 \r\nrating decision of the Oakland Regional Office (RO) of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) that in pertinent part \r\ndenied service connection for PTSD.  A Travel Board hearing \r\nwas held before the undersigned in September 2007; a \r\ntranscript of the hearing is of record.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\nIt is not shown that the veteran had temporary duty (TDY) at \r\nFort Chaffee in May or June 1975, and the veteran's alleged \r\nstressor event in service, witnessing the killing of a \r\nVietnamese Refugee in May or June 1975 at Fort Chaffee, is \r\nnot corroborated. \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred during active service.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n�� 1110, 1131 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304 (2007).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  VCAA\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) describes \r\nVA's duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a \r\nclaim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, \r\n5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2007); 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326(a) (2007).  \r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete \r\napplication for benefits, VA is required to notify the \r\nclaimant and his or her representative, if any, of any \r\ninformation, and any medical or lay evidence, that is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) \r\n(West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) (2007); Quartuccio v. \r\nPrincipi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  Proper VCAA notice must \r\ninform the claimant of any information and evidence not of \r\nrecord (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) \r\nthat VA will seek to provide; (3) that the claimant is \r\nexpected to provide; and (4) must ask the claimant to provide \r\nany evidence in her or his possession that pertains to the \r\nclaim in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1).  VCAA \r\nnotice should be provided to a claimant before the initial \r\nunfavorable agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on \r\na claim.  Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004).\r\n\r\nThe veteran has been advised of VA's duties to notify and \r\nassist in the development of his claim.  A February 2001 \r\nletter from the RO explained what the evidence needed to show \r\nto substantiate the claim.  It also explained that VA was \r\nresponsible for obtaining relevant records from any federal \r\nagency, and that VA would attempt to obtain records not held \r\nby a federal agency, but that it was the veteran's \r\nresponsibility to make sure that VA received all requested \r\nrecords not in the possession of a federal department or \r\nagency.  Although this letter did not advise the veteran \r\nverbatim to submit everything he had pertinent to his claim, \r\nit explained the type of evidence necessary to substantiate \r\nhis claim and asked him to submit any such evidence.  This \r\nwas equivalent to advising him to submit everything in his \r\npossession pertinent to the claim.  A March 2006 letter \r\nprovided notice regarding criteria for rating the \r\ndisabilities at issue and effective dates of awards in \r\naccordance with Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. \r\n473 (2006).  \r\n \r\nAlthough complete VCAA notice was not given prior to the \r\nrating on appeal, the appellant had ample opportunity to \r\nrespond to the notice letters and to supplement the record \r\nafter notice was given.  He is not prejudiced by any \r\ntechnical notice deficiency that may have occurred along the \r\nway, and no further notice is required.  See Conway v. \r\nPrincipi, 353 F.3d 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\r\n\r\nRegarding VA's duty to assist, the RO has obtained the \r\nveteran's service medical records, along with available VA \r\nand private medical evidence.  Also in 2002 the veteran was \r\nprovided with an \"information in support of a claim for PTSD \r\nform\" on which he reported his alleged stressor event, \r\nwitnessing the killing of a Vietnamese refugee while \r\nstationed at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas in May or June 1975.  In \r\nresponse the RO obtained the veteran's service personnel \r\nrecords and also made a request to the Service Department to \r\ncheck for any TDY orders from May to June 1975 showing TDY \r\nfor the veteran at Fort Chaffee but was unable to obtain \r\nverification of the TDY from either source.  The veteran has \r\nnot identified any additional evidence pertinent to this \r\nclaim.  VA's assistance obligations are met.  The veteran is \r\nnot prejudiced by the Board's proceeding with appellate \r\nreview.   \r\n\r\nII.  Factual Background\r\n\r\nService medical records do not reveal any findings, \r\ncomplaints or diagnoses of psychiatric disorder or stress-\r\nrelated pathology.  On the November 1976 separation \r\nexamination the veteran's psychiatric functioning was found \r\nto be normal and the veteran reported that, to the best of \r\nhis knowledge, he was in good health.  Service personnel \r\nrecords do not show any TDY assignments, disciplinary \r\nproblems or sudden change in the level of the veteran's \r\nperformance.  Performance evaluations generally show that the \r\nveteran met or exceeded his duty requirements.  The veteran's \r\nmilitary occupational specialty (MOS) was infantry indirect \r\nfire crewman.  The personnel records also do not show any \r\nevidence that the veteran served in combat, such as receipt \r\nof the Combat Infantryman Badge (nor has the veteran alleged \r\ncombat service).  From June 1973 until August 1975 the \r\nveteran was stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington.    \r\n\r\nA September 2000 VA psychological evaluation produced a \r\ndiagnostic impression of stress related to depression and \r\nPTSD.  The veteran reported that his depression had started \r\n15 to 16 years prior when he started having distressing \r\nmemories of Army incidents.  He referred to an incident in \r\n1974 where he saw someone accidentally killed at an Army \r\nshooting practice and seeing bodies of refugees who had been \r\nkilled during a Vietnam evacuation.  The veteran was \r\nsubsequently provided with sessions of brief psychotherapy \r\nfrom September to December 2000 to process his prior and \r\ncurrent stressors.  \r\n\r\nA June 2001 letter from a private psychiatrist indicated that \r\nhe had diagnosed the veteran as having PTSD.  He had had four \r\none hour long psychotherapy sessions with the veteran and had \r\nbeen gathering relevant psychological history using a \r\ncognitive approach.  He noted that the veteran traced his \r\nproblems back to a violent murder he reported to have \r\nwitnessed during service.  He stated that after observing the \r\nincident, the veteran was shipped from his base in Arkansas \r\nto one in Washington and told by his commander to act as if \r\nthe incident had never happened.  The veteran believed that \r\nit was not until his later days of military service (1977) \r\nthat he began to have recurring nightmares (6 to 9 months) in \r\nwhich he relived the traumatic event.  The veteran's primary \r\nsymptoms included difficulty sleeping, withdrawal and self \r\nisolation to his darkened room at home, abuse of alcohol and \r\ndrugs to numb his pain, anxiety, depression and avoidance of \r\nplaces, events and media that would arouse his memories and \r\nsubsequent distress.  \r\n\r\nA December 2001 VA progress note showed that the veteran \r\nreceived a pulmonary-sleep disorders consultation.  The \r\nveteran reported difficulty sleeping for the previous 20 \r\nyears with nightmares on the weekend, which would wake him up \r\naround 2 AM in the morning.  He would then have difficulty \r\nfalling back to sleep.  The veteran had very little snoring \r\nand no apnea or waking up.  The consultative examiner noted \r\nthat the veteran was only taking his mirtazapine 3 times per \r\nweek and should have been taking it daily and advised the \r\nveteran to follow up with psychiatry and to avoid alcohol \r\nprior to bedtime.    \r\n\r\nOn December 2001 VA psychosocial assessment the diagnoses \r\nwere non-combat PTSD and depression.  The veteran reported \r\nthat he had been having nightmares of witnessing the murder \r\nin service.  The murder took place at Fort Chafee, Arkansas \r\nwhere one Vietnamese refugee was killed by other Vietnamese \r\nrefugees.  The veteran also complained of depression to the \r\npoint of social withdrawal.  The veteran indicated that his \r\nproblems had been with him for 20 years.  It was noted that \r\nthe veteran had not had prior treatment for PTSD.  He had \r\ntried to get help from the VA ten years prior but left \r\nfeeling that there was no hope and was put off by the idea of \r\ntaking drugs for psychiatric problems.  The veteran also \r\nreported that he had smoked marijuana and crack cocaine in \r\nthe 80s and had drunk alcohol for social reasons but that he \r\nhad stopped using because of unwanted side effects and \r\nbecause he simply decided that drugs and alcohol were not for \r\nhim.  He was currently working as veteran's representative \r\nand had been employed 9 years.  Mental status examination \r\nshowed euthymic mood and appropriate affect with normal \r\ncognitive functioning but limited insight.  He was taking an \r\nantidepressant, mirtazapine, regularly.     \r\n\r\nA February 2002 VA progress note showed that the veteran was \r\nbeing seen for follow-up for psychiatric medication.  It was \r\nnoted that he continued to be troubled by occasional \r\nnightmares and flashbacks related to witnessing the murder in \r\nservice.  He could not watch any war movies.  He was given a \r\nprescription for mirtazapine and that had helped him but he \r\nwanted to increase the dose. \r\n\r\nAn April 2002 VA psychologist's progress note indicated that \r\nthe veteran was attending a series of 4 lectures entitled \r\n\"Introduction to PTSD.\"\r\n\r\nIn an April 2002 stressor statement the veteran indicated \r\nthat he had been a temporary transfer to Fort Chafee, \r\nArkansas.  There he was assigned to guard the southern end of \r\nthe Vietnamese refugee camp.  Somewhere around May or June \r\n1975, he witnessed the attack and killing of a Vietnamese man \r\nby other Vietnamese men who were stabbing him and hitting him \r\nwith sticks.  The veteran ran over to try to pull the man \r\naway from the crowd but he was outnumbered by them and they \r\nchased him away.  As of that moment, he felt that his life \r\nwas threatened and he ran and hollered out for help from the \r\nother guards.  He was so scared that he did not notice all \r\nthe blood on him.  The veteran's Lieutenant, Lieutenant Belt, \r\ntold him to provide him with a report of exactly what \r\nhappened.  The veteran did so but never wrote out a report \r\nbecause the Lieutenant ordered him not to do so.  Instead he \r\ntold the veteran to guard the north end of the Vietnamese \r\ncamp.  The lieutenant did tell him that they removed the body \r\nof the dead Vietnamese man from the camp grounds.  The \r\nveteran indicated that he had been having nightmares of the \r\nevent since he left Fort Lewis, Washington for duty in \r\nGermany (in December 1975).  He never told anyone else about \r\nthe killing or his nightmares until 27 years later.  \r\n\r\nOn August 2002 VA psychiatric evaluation the diagnoses were \r\nPTSD, history of major depression and alcohol, cocaine, \r\nmarijuana and PCP abuse.  The veteran reported that his \r\nnightmares, intrusive thoughts, anxiety and impulsive anger \r\nhad continued since he experienced trauma in the military.  \r\nHe recalled that when he tried to stop the crowd of \r\nVietnamese men from killing the man at the refugee camp, they \r\ncrowd started telling him \"DD Mao.\"  The veteran did not \r\nknow what this expression meant but from the crowd's gestures \r\nand actions he knew that they were going to kill him unless \r\nhe ran away.  He ran for his life and was unable to save the \r\nman who died and he had not been able to sleep well since the \r\nincident.  He often had nightmares where he heard the yelling \r\nof \"DD Mao\" and he also felt that the incident and trauma \r\nhad contributed to him distancing himself from his children \r\nand being excessively strict in disciplining them.  Often \r\nwhen he was having intrusive thoughts he would tell his \r\nchildren, \"DD Mao, DD Mao.\"  The veteran found out later \r\nthat \"DD Mao\" meant \"go away, go away.\"  The veteran also \r\nagain reported that he saw an accidental death during Army \r\ntraining exercises.   Additionally, the veteran had been in a \r\nvehicle that almost went off a cliff near Fort Lewis Virginia \r\nbecause the driver had fallen asleep.  The veteran was able \r\nto move the steering wheel in the right direction at the last \r\ninstant to keep the vehicle from descending but he believed \r\nthat that event had caused him marked anxiety.     \r\n\r\nAn August 2003 letter from a VA treating psychiatrist and a \r\nVA treatment coordinator indicated that when the veteran \r\nfirst came in for treatment in February 2002 he had exhibited \r\nsymptoms of intrusive thoughts, nightmares, hyper-vigilance, \r\nsuspicion and mistrust, along with depression, secondary to \r\nPTSD.  He still had intense issues of anger and was working \r\nvery hard on impulse control and emotion management.  He was \r\nfaithful in his treatment and attended all groups and \r\nindividual sessions but despite intense outpatient therapy, \r\nhis symptoms were ever present and he was not able to work on \r\na regular basis, sustain task orientation and had rage \r\nresponses to supervision.  In the practitioners' clinical \r\nopinion, it was highly unlikely that the veteran would be \r\nable to join the competitive work force to sustain himself.  \r\nThe clinical team thus supported his request for service \r\nconnected disability for PTSD.  \r\n\r\nIn a September 2004 statement the veteran indicated that he \r\nwas claiming only one stressful event, the witnessing of the \r\nmurder of the Vietnamese refugee at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas.  \r\n\r\nIn an April 2005 statement, a fellow serviceman indicated \r\nthat he was stationed with the veteran at Ft. Lewis, \r\nWashington.  The two men were roommates when they were off \r\nbase.  The fellow serviceman indicated that sometime around \r\nthe month of May or June 1975, when the veteran returned back \r\nfrom Fort Chaffee, Arkansas his behavior changed along with \r\nhim being upset and afraid to talk about what happened at \r\nFort Chafee.  A few months later the veteran was transferred \r\nto Germany to complete his remaining active duty service.  \r\n\r\nAt his September 2007 Board hearing the veteran reiterated \r\nthat his alleged stressor event in service took place while \r\nhe was on TDY as a guard at the Vietnamese refugee camp at \r\nFort Chaffee.  Around four or five o'clock in the evening the \r\nveteran saw a Vietnamese man get hacked and beaten to death \r\nby a crowd of other men.  The veteran tried to get to him to \r\npull him from the crowd but the crowd chased him away with \r\nknives and boards.  The veteran was forced to retreat and \r\nafter a while noticed that from all of the excitement he had \r\nblood on his fatigues, which made him \"freak out.\"  Ever \r\nsince then the incident had been traumatizing him.  He \r\ninitially did not seek out help thinking that he just wanted \r\nto focus on having a good life.  He eventually did seek help \r\nfrom the VA but only received insufficient temporary \r\nassistance.  Sometime after that he started self-medicating \r\nand isolating himself from his family.  By the time he \r\nrealized that he needed real help his marriage was already \r\ndissolved.  He also noted that he would always wake up in a \r\nsweat, tossing and turning.  The veteran indicated that he \r\nwas not in touch with any fellow serviceman (other than C.F. \r\nwho had already submitted a statement on his behalf regarding \r\nhis TDY) who could verify that he had TDY at Fort Chaffee or \r\nthat he witnessed the killing of the Vietnamese refugee \r\nthere.   \r\n\r\nIII.  Law and Regulations\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for a disability \r\nresulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by \r\nactive service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.303.  Service connection may be granted for any disease \r\ndiagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including \r\nthat pertinent to service, establishes that the disability \r\nwas incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a); \r\na link, established by medical evidence, between current \r\nsymptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting \r\nevidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  If \r\nthe evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat \r\nwith the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that \r\ncombat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to \r\nthe contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is \r\nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone \r\nmay establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service \r\nstressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nWhere VA determines that the veteran did not engage in \r\ncombat, the veteran's lay testimony, by itself, as a matter \r\nof law, cannot be sufficient to establish the alleged \r\nstressor.  Rather, the record must contain service records or \r\nother independent credible evidence to corroborate the \r\nveteran's testimony as to the alleged stressor. Dizoglio v. \r\nBrown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 166 (1996).  Those service records \r\nwhich are available must support and not contradict the \r\nveteran's lay testimony concerning the noncombat stressors.  \r\nDoran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, 289 (1994).  Additionally, \r\n\"[a]n opinion by a mental health professional based on a \r\npostservice examination of the veteran cannot be used to \r\nestablish the occurrence of a stressor.\"  Cohen v. Brown, 10 \r\nVet. App. 128, 145 (1997).\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of VA to administer the law under a broad \r\ninterpretation, consistent with the facts in each case with \r\nall reasonable doubt to be resolved in favor of the claimant; \r\nhowever, the reasonable doubt rule is not a means for \r\nreconciling actual conflict or a contradiction in the \r\nevidence.  38 C.F.R. � 3.102.\r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative \r\nevidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the \r\ndetermination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in \r\nresolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 5107(b).\r\n\r\nWhen all of the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for \r\ndetermining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in \r\nrelative equipoise, with the veteran prevailing in either \r\nevent, or whether a fair preponderance of the evidence is \r\nagainst the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  \r\nGilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990).\r\nIV.  Analysis\r\n\r\nIt is established that the veteran has a current diagnosis of \r\nPTSD as both VA and private mental health professionals have \r\ngiven him this diagnosis.  Also, this diagnosis has been \r\nlinked to the veteran's alleged stressor event in service; \r\nwitnessing the killing of the Vietnamese man at Fort Chaffee.   \r\nConsequently, the remaining question is whether this alleged \r\nstressor has been corroborated.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the veteran engaged in \r\ncombat nor has he alleged that he engaged in combat.  \r\nInstead, he has alleged the noncombat stressor of witnessing \r\nthe killing of the Vietnamese man at the Fort Chaffee.  The \r\nevidence of record, however, does not establish that the \r\nveteran actually had TDY at Fort Chaffee at the time he \r\nalleges the killing took place.  Nor does it show that the \r\nalleged killing actually took place.   \r\n\r\nThe only evidence of record showing that the veteran actually \r\nhad TDY at Fort Chaffee is his own self-report and the \r\nstatement of C.F., his fellow serviceman.  In contrast, the \r\nveteran's personnel records do not show that he ever had TDY \r\nat Fort Chaffee and there is no other documentation of record \r\nactually showing that he had TDY there.   Instead, these \r\nrecords show that the veteran was stationed at Fort Lewis, \r\nWashington, during May and June 1975, the time of the alleged \r\nkilling.  Although the veteran and C.F. are competent to \r\ntestify regarding the veteran having temporary duty at Fort \r\nChaffee, given the absence of any documentation confirming \r\nthe veteran's presence there and the personnel records \r\nindicating that the veteran was at Fort Lewis, the weight of \r\nthe evidence is against a finding that the veteran was \r\nactually stationed at Fort Chaffee. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, even if it were shown that the veteran was \r\nstationed at Fort Chaffee, the only evidence of record \r\nindicating that he witnessed a killing there in May or June \r\n1975 is his own lay testimony.  As noted above, by itself, \r\nsuch lay testimony is insufficient to establish an alleged \r\nnon-combat stressor.  Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 166 \r\n(1996).  Also, the post-service opinions of the mental health \r\nprofessionals of record, which indicate the presence of PTSD \r\nrelated to the veteran's alleged stressor cannot be used to \r\nestablish the actual occurrence of this stressor.  Cohen v. \r\nBrown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 145 (1997).  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that if it were established that the veteran \r\ndid have TDY at Fort Chaffee in May or June 1975, additional \r\ndevelopment would be warranted to attempt to corroborate \r\nwhether a Vietnamese man was killed in the manner indicated \r\nby the veteran during that TDY, and whether the veteran was \r\non guard duty when the killing occurred.  This, however, has \r\nnot been established and as noted above,   the Board has \r\ndetermined the RO met its duty to assist in attempting to \r\ncorroborate the veteran's alleged Fort Chaffee TDY in May or \r\nJune 1975 and was unable to do so.  Also, although the \r\nveteran did mention one individual, a Lieutenant Belt, who \r\ncould potentially corroborate the TDY and also the killing of \r\nthe Vietnamese refugee, he did not provide a first name for \r\nLieutenant Belt; so without more information, the RO would \r\nnot have a way of attempting to contact this individual.  \r\nAdditionally, the veteran indicated at his September 2007 \r\nBoard hearing that he had not remained in contact with anyone \r\n(other than C.F. who did submit a letter on behalf of the \r\nveteran) who could corroborate his actual presence at Fort \r\nChaffee or the alleged killing of the Vietnamese refugee.  \r\nThus, in the absence of any indication of an additional \r\nsource to which the RO could reasonably turn for further \r\ncorroboration efforts, the Board finds that further \r\ndevelopment at this point would serve no useful purpose.  If \r\nthe veteran can subsequently establish that he did have TDY \r\nat Fort Chaffee, he may be entitled to reopen this claim.  \r\n\r\nIn the absence of corroboration that the veteran had TDY at \r\nFort Chaffee and witnessed his alleged stressor event, the \r\nkilling of a Vietnamese refugee at Fort Chaffee, the \r\npreponderance of the evidence is against this claim and it \r\nmust be denied.   \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nJames L.

Skaltsounis, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from September 1977 to January \r\n1985, and from February 1991 to March 1991.\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal of a September 2003 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nMontgomery, Alabama, which denied the above claim.\r\n\r\nAlthough the claims folder reflects the Board's receipt of \r\nadditional information from the veteran in February 2008 \r\nwithout waiver of the RO's initial review of this evidence, \r\nas a result of the Board's decision to remand the claim, the \r\nBoard finds that efforts to obtain a waiver of this \r\nconsideration are not necessary. \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Board has carefully examined the RO's efforts to obtain \r\nthe veteran's personnel records from each of his periods of \r\nactive service, and finds that while the RO diligently \r\npursued the veteran's records from the appropriate agencies, \r\nthere is an indication that the personnel records from his \r\nfirst period of active service are incomplete.  More \r\nspecifically, the veteran asserts that he was attached to the \r\n1st Battalion, 9th Infantry when he was exposed to his \r\nprimary stressor in Korea in December 1979, and with the \r\nexception of photographs supplied by the veteran and the \r\nservice medical records for that period, there are no records \r\nthat confirm his attachment to that unit.  Consequently, the \r\nBoard finds that further efforts should be made to obtain \r\nadditional personnel records for the veteran from his first \r\nperiod of service, and that based on correspondence contained \r\nwithin the claims folder, this additional search should be \r\ndirected to both the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) \r\nand the Department of Veterans Affairs (RMC), P.O. Box 5020, \r\nSt. Louis, MO 63115-0020.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the record contains multiple diagnoses of PTSD, \r\nand the veteran has now supplied more detailed information \r\nwith respect to the stressor he contends he was exposed to \r\nwhile attached to the 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry Division \r\nduring a mission in the Korean DMZ in which casualties \r\nresulted from the detonation of a land mine.  Although the \r\nveteran's most recent account of the incident discloses the \r\nnames of two fellow service members that were killed in this \r\nincident as opposed to one service member as previously \r\nreported, and neglects to report the name of the fellow \r\nservice member who lost a leg in the explosion as was also \r\npreviously reported, the Board finds that this information, \r\ntogether with previously provided information, is \r\nsufficiently detailed to warrant further development.  There \r\nis also no indication that the U.S. Army and Joint Services \r\nRecords Research Center (JSRRC) was ever contacted for the \r\npurposes of obtaining the unit records for the 1st Battalion, \r\n9th Infantry, and based on the information provided by the \r\nveteran, that search could be limited to the period of \r\nDecember 1, 1979 to February 1, 1980.  Consequently, this \r\nclaim must also be remanded so an effort can be made to \r\nobtain these records.  In the event that this or another one \r\nof the veteran's claimed stressors is verified, the veteran \r\nshould then be provided with a psychiatric examination to \r\ndetermine whether he has PTSD that is linked to the verified \r\nstressor or stressors.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Arrangements should be made to \r\nobtain any additional VA treatment \r\nrecords for the veteran, dated since \r\nDecember 2005.\r\n\r\n2.  An effort should be made to obtain \r\nadditional personnel records for the \r\nveteran from his first period of \r\nservice, and this request should be \r\ndirected to both the NPRC and the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (RMC), \r\nP.O. Box 5020, St. Louis, MO 63115-\r\n0020.\r\n\r\n3.  An effort should be made to contact \r\nJSRRC located at 7701 Telegraph Road, \r\nKingman Building, Room 2C08, \r\nAlexandria, VA 22315-3802, and request \r\nthat JSRRC research the unit history of \r\nthe 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry \r\nDivision for the period of December 1, \r\n1979 to February 1, 1980, to determine \r\nwhether it sustained any casualties \r\nduring this period as a result of the \r\naccidental detonation of a land mine by \r\na patrol in the area of the Korea DMZ.  \r\n\r\n4.  In the event that a stressor is \r\nverified, the RO/AMC should note that \r\nfor the record and schedule the veteran \r\nfor a VA psychiatric examination.  The \r\nclaims folder must be made available to \r\nthe examiner for review.   \r\n\r\nThe diagnosis should be in accordance \r\nwith the American Psychiatric \r\nAssociation's: Diagnostic and \r\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders-\r\nIV (DSM-IV).  All necessary special \r\nstudies or tests are to be \r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nThe examiner must express an opinion as \r\nto whether the veteran meets the \r\ncriteria for PTSD contained in DSM-IV, \r\nand if he meets such criteria, whether \r\nPTSD can be related to the stressor or \r\nstressors reported by the veteran and \r\nestablished as having occurred during \r\nthe veteran's active service.\r\n\r\nThe examiner must provide a \r\ncomprehensive report including complete \r\nrationales for all conclusions reached.\r\n\r\n5.  Finally, readjudicate the claim on \r\nappeal.  If the benefits sought on appeal \r\nremain denied, the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative should be provided a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case, and \r\ngiven the opportunity to respond thereto.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the case should be returned to the Board, if in \r\norder.  The Board intimates no opinion as to the ultimate \r\noutcome of this case.  The appellant need take no action \r\nunless otherwise notified.  The appellant has the right to \r\nsubmit additional evidence and argument on the matter or \r\nmatters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 \r\nVet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2007).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nP.M.

The rating decision denied \r\nentitlement to service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD that is \r\nassociated with a stressor during his period of active \r\nmilitary service, for which there is credible supporting \r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was incurred in active service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, \r\n1154, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3.304(f) \r\n(2007).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000\r\n\r\n The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) and \r\nimplementing regulations impose obligations on VA to provide \r\nclaimants with notice and assistance.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5102, \r\n5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2008); 38 C.F.R �� \r\n3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2007).\r\n\r\nThe VCAA is not applicable where further assistance would not \r\naid the appellant in substantiating her claim.  Wensch v. \r\nPrincipi, 15 Vet App 362 (2001); see 38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n5103A(a)(2) (Secretary not required to provide assistance \r\n\"if no reasonable possibility exists that such assistance \r\nwould aid in substantiating the claim\"); see also VAOPGCPREC \r\n5- 2004; 69 Fed. Reg. 59989 (2004) (holding that the notice \r\nand duty to assist provisions of the VCAA do not apply to \r\nclaims that could not be substantiated through such notice \r\nand assistance).  In view of the Board's favorable decision \r\nin this appeal, further assistance is unnecessary to aid the \r\nappellant in substantiating his claims. \r\n\r\nFactual Background\r\n\r\nThe veteran served from September 1952 to November 1955.  \r\nThree years, two months, and sixteen days of service were \r\nforeign.\r\n\r\nThe veteran's records show that he was an aircraft mechanic \r\nassigned to composite squadron VC-6.  His DD-214 does not \r\nreflect any award that indicates the veteran was in combat, \r\nbut the veteran did earn the Korean Service Medal, United \r\nNations Service Medal, and National Defense Service Medal.\r\n\r\nThe veteran has reported that after his discharge from the \r\nmilitary, he suffered nightmares, agitation, and anxiety.  \r\nThese symptoms were verified by his wife.  The veteran sought \r\nprivate psychological treatment for these symptoms, but did \r\nnot reveal any causes thereof to the provider.  \r\n\r\nIn June 2004, the veteran was referred by his primary care \r\nprovider to the behavioral health division of the Albany, New \r\nYork VA Medical Center (VAMC).  He was referred for \r\nevaluation of anxiety symptoms.  The psychologist noted that \r\nalthough the veteran tested negative on a PTSD screening \r\nadministered by his primary care provider, he suffered from \r\ndifficulty falling and staying asleep as well as unwanted \r\nthoughts about his military service.  The veteran expressed \r\nthat he was unsure whether or not he was responsible for the \r\nsinking of a plane off of the aircraft carrier on which he \r\nserved.  The psychologist noted that the veteran should be \r\nevaluated to determine if he had PTSD and/or an anxiety \r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nIn an October 2004 follow-up appointment for possible PTSD \r\nassociated with military experiences, the veteran stated that \r\nthere were aspects of the in-service incident that he could \r\nnot remember.  The VA psychologist explained PTSD-related \r\navoidance and amnesia for important aspects of traumatic \r\nevents.\r\n\r\nThe veteran completed a PTSD questionnaire in December 2004 \r\nin which he indicated that the stressor event occurred \r\nbetween summer 1953 and December 1954 aboard the largest \r\nEssex class carrier assigned to the seventh fleet, identified \r\nas the U.S.S. Yorktown.  He stated that he would help inspect \r\nthe tailhook and landing gear of planes prior to take-off.  \r\nAfter making one such inspection and approving the plane for \r\ntake-off, the veteran reported that the plane crashed into \r\nthe ocean while taking off and did a couple of flips before \r\nit sank.  He reported that the pilot and co-pilot were \r\nrescued, but the radioman, named Black, was killed.  He \r\nstated that the thought of possible responsibility for the \r\ncrash has troubled him since the incident.\r\n\r\nIn May 2005, the veteran was admitted to the VAMC in Albany \r\nfor evaluation and treatment of parasomnias.  In July 2005, \r\nhe was recommended for PTSD screening.  In August and \r\nSeptember 2005 he was diagnosed with an Axis I depressive \r\ndisorder and PTSD and with Axis IV moderate stressors.\r\n\r\nThe RO inquired to the U.S. Army & Joint Services Records \r\nResearch Center (JSRRC) in order to verify the stressor \r\nevent.  JSRRC could not verify the specific event described \r\nby the veteran, but noted an August 6, 1954 crash of a plane \r\nattempting to land aboard the U.S.S. Yorktown.  The plane's \r\nthree crewmen were subsequently rescued.\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nApplicable laws and regulations in service connection claims\r\n\r\nService connection will be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110.\r\n\r\nEstablishing service connection generally requires (1) \r\nmedical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in \r\ncertain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence \r\nor aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical \r\nevidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or \r\ninjury and the present disability.

Lay testimony is competent, \r\nhowever, to establish the presence of observable \r\nsymptomatology and \"may provide sufficient support for a \r\nclaim of service connection.\"  Layno v.

App. at 496 \r\n(citing Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 16, 19 (1991).  Once \r\nevidence is determined to be competent, the Board must \r\ndetermine whether such evidence is also credible.  See Layno, \r\nsupra (distinguishing between competency (\"a legal concept \r\ndetermining whether testimony may be heard and considered\") \r\nand credibility (\"a factual determination going to the \r\nprobative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence \r\nhas been admitted\").\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed \r\nafter discharge, when all the evidence, including that \r\npertinent to service, establishes that the disease was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).  \r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative \r\nevidence regarding any issue material to the determination of \r\na matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt \r\nto the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107 (West 2002); see also \r\nGilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).\r\n\r\nIn order for a claim for service connection for PTSD to be \r\nsuccessful, there must be: (1) medical evidence diagnosing \r\nthe condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a); (2) a \r\nlink, established by medical evidence, between the current \r\nsymptoms and an in-service stressor; and (3) credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor \r\noccurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2007).\r\n\r\nThe evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a \r\nrecognizable stressor during service to support a diagnosis \r\nof PTSD will vary depending upon whether the veteran \r\n\"engaged in combat with the enemy.\"  See 38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n1154(b) (West 2002); Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997); \r\nZarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 (1993); 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.304(f) (2007).  Participation in combat, a determination \r\nthat is to be made on a case-by-case basis, requires that the \r\nveteran have personally participated in events constituting \r\nan actual fight or encounter with a military foe or hostile \r\nunit or instrumentality.  See VAOPGCPREC 12-99 (1999).\r\n\r\nIf VA determines that the veteran engaged in combat with the \r\nenemy and his alleged stressor is combat-related, then his \r\nlay testimony or statement is accepted as conclusive evidence \r\nof the stressor's occurrence and no further development or \r\ncorroborative evidence is required, provided that such \r\ntestimony is found to be consistent with circumstances, \r\nconditions, or hardships of service.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n1154(b); Cohen v. Brown, at 146-47; Zarycki v. Brown, at 98; \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nIf the veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy, or \r\nthe claimed stressor is not related to combat, the veteran's \r\nlay testimony alone will not be enough to establish the \r\noccurrence of the alleged stressor.  See Moreau v. Brown, 9 \r\nVet. App. 389, 395 (1996); Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. \r\n163, 166 (1996).  In such cases, the record must contain \r\nservice records or other corroborative evidence that \r\nsubstantiates or verifies the veteran's statements as to the \r\noccurrence of the claimed stressor.  See West (Carlton) v. \r\nBrown, 7 Vet. App. 70, 76 (1994); Zarycki v. Brown at 98.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the medical evidence demonstrates a diagnosis \r\nof PTSD.  That diagnosis has been attributed to an in-service \r\nnon-combat stressor.  Two of the three elements for service \r\nconnection are thus satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe remaining question is whether there is credible \r\nsupporting evidence of the claimed stressor, or whether the \r\nevidence shows that the veteran engaged in combat and thus \r\nneeds no supporting evidence for his stressors.\r\n\r\nThe veteran's service records show that he served in Korea \r\nduring the Korean War. However, there are no references to \r\ncombat in the veteran's service personnel records.  He did \r\nnot earn any decorations, medals, badges, ribbons, or awards \r\nindicative of participation in combat.  For these reasons, \r\nthe Board concludes that the veteran's service personnel \r\nrecords do not indicate that he engaged in combat with the \r\nenemy.  Accordingly, the veteran's service records or other \r\ncorroborative evidence must substantiate or verify the \r\nveteran's claimed stressors.\r\n\r\nAlthough JSRRC could not verify the specific event described \r\nby the veteran, it noted an August 6, 1954 crash of a plane \r\nattempting to land aboard the U.S.S. Yorktown.  The event \r\ndescribed by JSRRC differs from the event described by the \r\nveteran in that none of the plane's three crewmen died as a \r\nresult of the accident and the plane crashed during landing \r\nrather than take-off.\r\n\r\nCredible supporting evidence need not corroborate every \r\ndetail of a claimed stressor.  Suozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. \r\n307, 311 (1997).  The records need only imply the veteran's \r\nparticipation (e.g., to not controvert the veteran's \r\nassertion that he was present when the events the records \r\nestablish that his unit experienced occurred).  Pentecost v. \r\nPrincipi, 16 Vet. App. 124, 128-9 (2002).  In this case, the \r\nevidence of record shows that there was a plane crash off the \r\nside of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Yorktown in 1954.  Thus, \r\nthe report is sufficient corroboration of the plane crash \r\nstressor and satisfies that element of a PTSD claim.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the medical evidence shows that the plane crash \r\nstressor has been linked to the veteran's currently diagnosed \r\nPTSD.  The Albany VAMC psychologist noted that the veteran \r\nhad PTSD that was associated with military service and \r\nreferenced PTSD-related avoidance and amnesia.  As such, the \r\nBoard finds that the veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD \r\nthat is associated with a reported stressor which has been \r\nverified to have occurred during his period of active \r\nmilitary service.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nResolving all doubt in the veteran's favor, the Board finds \r\nthat each of the elements for service connection has been \r\nsatisfied.  Service connection for PTSD is warranted. \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nMark D.

Mullins, Associate Counsel \r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from February 1971 to January \r\n1975.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a June 2006 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO) in \r\nNashville, Tennessee.\r\n\r\nAs procedural matter, the Board notes that the veteran \r\nappeared to raise a claim for fibromyalgia by correspondence \r\ndated in October 2005.  If he desires to pursue that claim, \r\nhe should do so with specificity at the RO.      \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The evidence of record does not demonstrate that the \r\nveteran engaged in combat with the enemy.\r\n\r\n2.  The weight of the competent evidence supports a diagnosis \r\nof PTSD.\r\n\r\n3.  The evidence of record does not verify any of the \r\nveteran's claimed in-service stressors and he has failed to \r\nprovide sufficient information to corroborate reported non-\r\ncombat stressors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by active duty \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1154(a), 5103, 5103A, 5107 \r\n(West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304(f), \r\n3.307, 3.309, 4.125(a) (2007).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 1110; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a) (2007).  For the \r\nshowing of chronic disease in service, there is required a \r\ncombination of manifestations sufficient to identify the \r\ndisease entity, and sufficient observation to establish \r\nchronicity at the time.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b) (2007).  If \r\nchronicity in service is not established, a showing of \r\ncontinuity of symptoms after discharge is required to support \r\nthe claim.  Id.  \r\n\r\nFurther, service connection may also be granted for any \r\ndisease diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence \r\nestablishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1113 (b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d) (2007).  \r\nThe Board must determine whether the evidence supports the \r\nclaim or is in relative equipoise, with the appellant \r\nprevailing in either case, or whether the preponderance of \r\nthe evidence is against the claim, in which case, service \r\nconnection must be denied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. \r\n49 (1990). \r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 4.125(a) (conforming to the Diagnostic and Statistical \r\nManual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)); (2) \r\nmedical evidence establishing a link between current symptoms \r\nand an in-service stressor; and (3) credible supporting \r\nevidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nIn adjudicating a claim for service connection for PTSD, the \r\nevidence necessary to establish the incurrence of a stressor \r\nduring service will vary depending on whether or not the \r\nveteran was \"engaged in combat with the enemy.\"  See Hayes \r\nv. Brown, \r\n5 Vet. App. 60, 66 (1993).  \r\n\r\nIf it is determined through military citation or other \r\nsupportive evidence that a veteran engaged in combat with the \r\nenemy, and the claimed stressors are related to combat, the \r\nveteran's lay testimony regarding the reported stressors must \r\nbe accepted as conclusive evidence as to their actual \r\noccurrence and no further development or corroborative \r\nevidence will be necessary, provided that the testimony is \r\nfound to be satisfactory, that is, not contradicted by \r\nservice records and \"consistent with the circumstances, \r\nconditions, or hardships of such service.\"  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 1154(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d),(f) (2007); \r\nDoran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, 289 (1994).  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the veteran did not engage in combat \r\nwith the enemy, or the claimed stressor is not related to \r\ncombat, then the veteran's testimony alone does not suffice \r\nto establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor; instead, \r\nthe veteran must corroborate his testimony by credible \r\nsupporting evidence.  See Stone v. Nicholson, 480 F.3d 1111 \r\n(Fed. Cir. 2007) (finding no error in Board determination \r\nthat a non-combat veteran's \"own statements cannot serve as \r\n'corroboration' of the facts contained in those \r\nstatements\").   See Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 \r\n(1993). \r\n\r\nThe phrase \"engaged in combat with the enemy\" requires that \r\nthe veteran have personally taken part in a fight or \r\nencounter with a military foe or hostile unit or \r\ninstrumentality.  VAOPGCPREC 12-99 (October 18, 1999); Moran \r\nv. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 149 (2003); see also Sizemore v. \r\nPrincipi, 18 Vet. App. 264, 273-74 (2004).  \r\n\r\nIn this case, the evidence does not show nor does the veteran \r\nallege that he actually engaged the enemy in combat.  \r\nAlthough he had 1 year and 11 months of foreign service \r\nduring the Vietnam Era, the DD Form 214 and service personnel \r\nrecords show that his military occupational specialty (MOS) \r\nwas an aircraft maintenance specialist, and that he earned \r\nthe National Defense Service Medal and Air Force Good Conduct \r\nMedal.  There is no indication that he served in the Republic \r\nof Vietnam.  Thus, the evidence does not reflect that he \r\nreceived any awards, citations, or decoration denoting having \r\nserved in combat in Vietnam.  \r\n\r\nAs noted above, service connection for PTSD requires medical \r\nevidence establishing a diagnosis of the condition, a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence, between the current \r\nsymptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor, and \r\ncredible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service \r\nstressor actually occurred.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304.  \r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, the Board notes that the service \r\nmedical records reflect complaints of depression and anxiety \r\nassociated with a divorce and financial problems.  At the \r\ntime of separation, his psychiatric evaluation was normal.  \r\n\r\nPost service records demonstrate that the veteran has been \r\ndiagnosed with PTSD.  In a January 2005 VA examination, \r\nunderstand for purposes of a pension claim, the examiner \r\nnoted that the veteran had \"probable PTSD.\"  Subsequent VA \r\nclinical records reflect diagnoses of a mood disorder and \r\nPTSD.  Therefore, the Board finds that there is competent \r\nmedical evidence of record supporting a current diagnosis of \r\nPTSD. \r\n\r\nMoreover, the treating health care providers related the \r\nveteran's current diagnosis of PTSD to his experiences in \r\nservice; therefore, the Board finds that the veteran's PTSD \r\nhas been related to active duty service.  \r\n\r\nAs noted above, in order for service connection for PTSD to \r\nbe warranted, the PTSD diagnosis must be based upon a \r\ncorroborated in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R.  � 3.304(f).  \r\nThe veteran claims that he is entitled to service connection \r\nfor PTSD because of in-service stressful events that occurred \r\nduring his active duty service in Vietnam.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, his reported stressors include (i) that he was \r\nattached to aircraft in Hawaii that were in 24-hour per day \r\nreadiness and that any launch of the aircraft reflected a \r\nsevere situation any where in the world, (ii) he was sent to \r\nThailand to pick up dead bodies in June 1971, and (iii) he \r\nhad several near-misses from missiles shot at the aircraft \r\nwhile operating over Vietnam.    \r\n\r\nWith respect to being in 24-hour readiness and near misses, \r\nthese stressors are not the type that can be verified and are \r\nnot sufficiently quantifiable to verify.  His statements as \r\nto these stressors have been vague, at best, as to dates and \r\ndetails and he has offered little in the way of specificity \r\nof events.  In addition, stressors such as the need to be in \r\nreadiness is not the type of stressor contemplated by the \r\nregulations which would support a claim for PTSD.  Moreover, \r\nalthough asked for additional information, the veteran has \r\noffered no specific dates in which these incidents occurred.  \r\nTherefore, there is no basis on which to verify these \r\nstressors.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the handling of dead bodies, the veteran's \r\nservice personnel records reflect that from February 1971 to \r\nSeptember 1971 he was an apprentice aircraft mechanic.  His \r\nduties included performing pre-flight, 7 day home station \r\ncheck, and thru flight inspections.  He launched aircraft on \r\nmissions and serviced aircraft systems as directed.  He \r\nassisted in towing and parking of aircraft.  There is no \r\nindication that he was required to handle dead bodies or that \r\nhe was part of a flight crew that was responsible for \r\ntransportation of dead bodies.  Therefore, his stressor \r\nregarding transporting dead bodies is not verified in the \r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, service connection for PTSD requires three \r\nelements:  (1) a current medical diagnosis of PTSD (presumed \r\nto include the adequacy of the PTSD symptomatology and the \r\nsufficiency of a claimed in-service stressor); (2) credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor \r\nactually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a causal nexus \r\nbetween current symptomatology and the specific claimed in-\r\nservice stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2007); Cohen v. \r\nBrown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  \r\n\r\nEven when the medical evidence of record establishes the \r\nfirst and third elements of the claim (a diagnosis of PTSD \r\nrelated to claimed in-service stressors), the record fails to \r\nestablish the second element of the claim (credible evidence \r\nthat stressor actually occurred).  Absent credible supporting \r\nevidence that the claimed in-service stressors as described \r\nby the veteran actually occurred, an essential element for a \r\ngrant of service connection for PTSD is not established and \r\nthe appeal is denied.  \r\n\r\nNext, while the veteran alleges that his current PTSD is \r\nrelated to his service, there are no records which reflect \r\ntreatment for psychiatric problems prior to 2005, 30 years \r\nafter separation from service.  Accordingly, entitlement to \r\nservice connection for a psychosis on a presumptive basis is \r\nnot warranted because no disorder was shown within the \r\napplicable presumptive period following his separation from \r\nservice.  See 38 C.F.R.� 3.309.  \r\n\r\nIn making such determinations, the Board has considered the \r\nveteran's statements asserting a relationship between his \r\nPTSD and active duty service.  In rendering a decision on \r\nappeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative \r\nvalue of the evidence, account for the evidence which it \r\nfinds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and provide the \r\nreasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable \r\nto the claimant.  See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, \r\n39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 \r\n(1990).  \r\n\r\nCompetency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  \r\nThe former is a legal concept determining whether testimony \r\nmay be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while the \r\nlater is a factual determination going to the probative value \r\nof the evidence to be made after the evidence has been \r\nadmitted.  Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno \r\nv. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Cartwright v. \r\nDerwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) (\"although interest may \r\naffect the credibility of testimony, it does not affect \r\ncompetency to testify\").\r\n\r\nThe veteran is competent to report symptoms because this \r\nrequires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as \r\nit comes to him through his senses.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. \r\nApp. at 470.  As a lay person, however, he is not competent \r\nto offer opinions on medical diagnosis or causation, and the \r\nBoard may not accept unsupported lay speculation with regard \r\nto medical issues. See Moray v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 211 \r\n(1993); Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 482 (1992).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn sum, the evidence of record does not verify any of the \r\nveteran's claimed in-service stressors.  Accordingly, the \r\nappeal is denied.  \r\n\r\nFinally, as provided for by the Veterans Claims Assistance \r\nAct of 2000 (VCAA), VA has a duty to notify and assist \r\nclaimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 \r\n& Supp. 2007); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and \r\n3.326(a) (2007).  \r\n\r\nProper notice from VA must inform the claimant of any \r\ninformation and medical or lay evidence not of record (1) \r\nthat is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will \r\nseek to provide; (3) that the claimant is expected to \r\nprovide; and (4) must ask the claimant to provide any \r\nevidence in her or his possession that pertains to the claim \r\nin accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1).  Quartuccio v. \r\nPrincipi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  This notice must be \r\nprovided prior to an initial unfavorable decision on a claim \r\nby the RO.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. \r\n2006); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004).  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the notice requirements of the VCAA apply to all \r\nfive elements of a service-connection claim, including: (1) \r\nveteran status; (2) existence of a disability; (3) a \r\nconnection between the veteran's service and the disability; \r\n(4) degree of disability; and (5) effective date of the \r\ndisability.  See Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. \r\n473 (2006).  Further, this notice must include information \r\nthat a disability rating and an effective date for the award \r\nof benefits will be assigned if service connection is \r\nawarded.  Id. at 486.  \r\n\r\nVCAA notice errors are presumed prejudicial unless VA shows \r\nthat the error did not affect the essential fairness of the \r\nadjudication.  To overcome the burden of prejudicial error, \r\nVA must show (1) that any defect was cured by actual \r\nknowledge on the part of the claimant; (2) that a reasonable \r\nperson could be expected to understand from the notice what \r\nwas needed; or, (3) that a benefit could not have been \r\nawarded as a matter of law.  See Sanders v. Nicholson, 487 \r\nF.3d 881 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  \r\n\r\nHere, the VCAA duty to notify was satisfied by way of a \r\nletter sent to the veteran in March 2006 that fully addressed \r\nall four notice elements and was sent prior to the initial RO \r\ndecision in this matter.  The letter informed him of what \r\nevidence was required to substantiate the claim and of his \r\nand VA's respective duties for obtaining evidence.  He was \r\nalso asked to submit evidence and/or information in his \r\npossession to the RO.  \r\n\r\nThere is no allegation from the veteran that he has any \r\nevidence in his possession that is needed for full and fair \r\nadjudication of this claim.  Under these circumstances, the \r\nBoard finds that the notification requirements of the VCAA \r\nhave been satisfied as to both timing and content.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Dingess requirements, in June 2006 and \r\nJanuary 2007, the RO provided the veteran with notice of what \r\ntype of information and evidence was needed to establish a \r\ndisability rating, as well as notice of the type of evidence \r\nnecessary to establish an effective date.  With those \r\nletters, the RO effectively satisfied the remaining notice \r\nrequirements with respect to the issue on appeal.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, adequate notice was provided to the veteran prior \r\nto the transfer and certification of his case to the Board \r\nand complied with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. � 5103(a) and \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b).  \r\n\r\nNext, VA has a duty to assist the veteran in the development \r\nof the claim.  This duty includes assisting him in the \r\nprocurement of service medical records and pertinent \r\ntreatment records and providing an examination when \r\nnecessary.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A; 38 C.F.R. � 3.159.  \r\n\r\nIn determining whether the duty to assist requires that a VA \r\nmedical examination be provided or medical opinion obtained \r\nwith respect to a veteran's claim for benefits, there are \r\nfour factors for consideration.  \r\n\r\nThese four factors are:  (1) whether there is competent \r\nevidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent \r\nsymptoms of a disability; (2) whether there is evidence \r\nestablishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in \r\nservice, or evidence establishing certain diseases \r\nmanifesting during an applicable presumption period; (3) \r\nwhether there is an indication that the disability or \r\nsymptoms may be associated with the veteran's service or with \r\nanother service-connected disability; and (4) whether there \r\notherwise is sufficient competent medical evidence of record \r\nto make a decision on the claim.  38 U.S.C. � 5103A(d); \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(4).  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the third factor above, the Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims has stated that this element establishes \r\na low threshold and requires only that the evidence \r\n\"indicates\" that there \"may\" be a nexus between the \r\ncurrent disability or symptoms and the veteran's service.  \r\n\r\nThe types of evidence that \"indicate\" that a current \r\ndisability \"may be associated\" with military service \r\ninclude, but are not limited to, medical evidence that \r\nsuggests a nexus but is too equivocal or lacking in \r\nspecificity to support a decision on the merits, or credible \r\nevidence of continuity of symptomatology such as pain or \r\nother symptoms capable of lay observation.  McLendon v. \r\nNicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  \r\n\r\nAs discussed above, the veteran's asserted in-service \r\nstressors are not verified in the record.  Under the \r\ncircumstances of this case, additional efforts to assist him \r\nby providing a VA examination would serve no useful purpose.  \r\nSee Soyini v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 (1991) (strict \r\nadherence to requirements in the law does not dictate an \r\nunquestioning, blind adherence in the face of overwhelming \r\nevidence in support of the result in a particular case and \r\nthat such adherence would result in unnecessarily imposing \r\nadditional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the \r\nveteran); see also Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 \r\n(1994) (remands which would only result in unnecessarily \r\nimposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to \r\nthe veteran are to be avoided).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Board finds that a remand for additional \r\ndevelopment to obtain a response from the Joint Services \r\nRecords Research Center (JSRRC) is not necessary in the \r\npresent case.  The veteran has not provided sufficient \r\ninformation to verify stressors to allow for verification \r\nwith the JSRRC and other organizations.  For example, no \r\nspecific dates or locations were provided sufficient for \r\nadditional development to be obtained.  \r\n\r\nFurther, the RO made an additional request for information on \r\nthe veteran's claimed in-service stressors, but to date he \r\nhas not responded.  The burden lies on the veteran to \r\ncooperate with VA.  While VA has a statutory duty to assist \r\nin developing evidence pertinent to a claim, he also has a \r\nduty to assist and cooperate with VA in developing evidence; \r\nthe duty to assist is not a one-way street.  See Wood v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991).\r\n    \r\nBased on the above, the Board finds that all necessary \r\ndevelopment has been accomplished, and therefore appellate \r\nreview may proceed without prejudice to the appellant.  See \r\nBernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384 (1993).  The RO has \r\nobtained VA treatment records, service medical records, and \r\nservice personnel records.  \r\n\r\nSignificantly, neither the veteran nor his representative has \r\nidentified, and the record does not otherwise indicate, any \r\nadditional existing evidence that is necessary for a fair \r\nadjudication of the claim that has not been obtained.  Hence, \r\nno further notice or assistance is required to fulfill VA's \r\nduty to assist in the development of the claim.  Smith v. \r\nGober, 14 Vet.

Mazzucchelli, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from March 1947 to October \r\n1947 and from July 1948 to October 1971.  This matter \r\noriginally came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from a January 2004 rating decision by the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nSt. Petersburg, Florida.  The veteran's representative \r\nsubmitted a motion to advance the veteran's case on the \r\ndocket in February 2007.  The motion was granted in March \r\n2007.  An April 2007 Board decision, in pertinent part, \r\nremanded the issue on appeal for additional development.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that his hypertension either began in \r\nservice or is related to his service connected PTSD.  The \r\nmost recent supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) \r\naddressing the issue on appeal was dated in April 2008.  In \r\nMay 2008, the veteran submitted medical evidence, including \r\nrecords showing elevated blood pressure readings as early as \r\n1984.  This evidence, which was not previously of record, has \r\nnot been considered by the RO, and the veteran has not waived \r\ninitial AOJ consideration of this evidence.  Consequently, it \r\nmust be reviewed by the RO before it can be reviewed by the \r\nBoard.  38 C.F.R. � 20.1304.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should readjudicate the claim \r\non appeal, with consideration of all \r\nevidence added to the record since the \r\nmost recent SSOC in April 2008, and \r\nspecifically the medical evidence \r\nsubmitted by the veteran in May 2008.  If \r\nthe appeal remains denied, the RO should \r\nissue an appropriate SSOC and provide the \r\nveteran and his representative the \r\nopportunity to respond.  The case should \r\nthen be returned to the Board for further \r\nappellate review, if otherwise in order.  \r\nNo action is required of the appellant \r\nuntil he is notified.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2008).\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nMARK W.

W. Loeb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe evidence on file indicates that the veteran served on \r\nactive military duty from January 1976 to December 1978 and \r\nfrom January 1980 to July 1992.  \r\n\r\nThis case initially comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from the RO.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The veteran is not shown to have had combat with the \r\nenemy while serving on active duty, including during his \r\nactive service in the Persian Gulf   \r\n\r\n2.  A medically supportable diagnosis of PTSD based on a \r\nverified stressor or a potentially verifiable stressor event \r\nor incident during a period of the veteran's service is not \r\ndemonstrated.   \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe veteran does not have a disability manifested by PTSD due \r\nto disease or injury that was incurred in or aggravated by \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002); \r\n38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304 (2007).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nInitial Considerations\r\n\r\nThe Board has given consideration to the provisions of the \r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA).  See \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126 \r\n(West 2002 and Supp. 2006).  The regulations implementing \r\nVCAA have been enacted.  See 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), \r\n3.159, 3.326(a) (2007).  \r\n\r\nVA has a duty to notify the claimant of any information and \r\nevidence needed to substantiate and complete a claim.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 5102, 5103.  See also Quartuccio v. Principi, \r\n16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  After having carefully reviewed the \r\nrecord on appeal, the Board has concluded that the notice \r\nrequirements of VCAA have been satisfied with respect to the \r\nissue decided herein.  \r\n\r\nIn June 2001, July 2005, September 2006, and November 2006, \r\nthe RO sent the veteran a letter in which he was informed of \r\nthe requirements needed to establish service connection.  \r\n\r\nIn accordance with the requirements of VCAA, the letters \r\ninformed the veteran what evidence and information he was \r\nresponsible for and the evidence that was considered VA's \r\nresponsibility.  Additional private evidence was subsequently \r\nadded to the record after each letter.  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the veteran was informed in the \r\nSeptember 2006 letter that a disability rating and effective \r\ndate would be assigned if his claim was granted.  See \r\nDingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).  \r\n\r\nVA has a duty to assist the claimant in obtaining evidence \r\nnecessary to substantiate a claim.  VCAA also requires VA to \r\nprovide a medical examination when such an examination is \r\nnecessary to make a decision on the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5103A (d); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159.  \r\n\r\nThere is no nexus opinion on file on whether the veteran \r\nhas PTSD due to service.  Such development is to be \r\nconsidered necessary if the information of record does not \r\ncontain sufficient medical evidence to decide the claim, \r\nbut contains competent evidence of diagnosed PTSD; \r\nestablishes a verified service stressor; and indicates \r\nthat the claimed disability may be associated with the in-\r\nservice stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(4).  Because not \r\nall of these requirements have been met, as discussed \r\nhereinbelow, a VA examination or related medical opinion \r\nis not required with regard this issue.  \r\n\r\nThe Board concludes that all available evidence that is \r\npertinent to the claim decided herein has been obtained \r\nand that there is sufficient medical evidence on file on \r\nwhich to make a decision on the issue.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran has been given ample opportunity to present \r\nevidence and argument in support of his claim.  The Board \r\nadditionally finds that general due process considerations \r\nhave been complied with by VA.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.103 (2007).  \r\n\r\nFinally, to the extent that VA has failed to fulfill any duty \r\nto notify and assist the veteran, the Board finds any such \r\ndefect to be harmless.  Of course, an error is not harmless \r\nwhen it \"reasonably affect(s) the outcome of the case.\"  \r\nATD Corp. v. Lydall, Inc., 159 F.3d 534, 549 (Fed.Cir. 1998).  \r\n\r\nIn this case, however, as there is no evidence that any \r\nfailure on the part of VA to further comply with VCAA \r\nreasonably affects the outcome of this case, the Board finds \r\nthat any such omission is harmless.  See Mayfield v. \r\nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 103 (2005) rev'd on other grounds, \r\n444 F. 3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); see also Dingess/Hartman v. \r\nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).  \r\n\r\n\r\nLaw And Regulations\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability or injury \r\nincurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).  \r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted for disability shown \r\nafter service, when all of the evidence, including that \r\npertinent to service, shows that it was incurred in service.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d); Cosman v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 303, \r\n305 (1992).  \r\n\r\nIn order to establish service connection for the claimed \r\ndisorder, there must be (1) medical evidence of a current \r\ndisability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay \r\nevidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease \r\nor injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the \r\nclaimed in-service disease or injury and the current \r\ndisability.  See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 \r\n(1999).  \r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nThe veteran asserts that he has PTSD caused by stressful \r\nevents to which he was exposed in service.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran served in the Persian Gulf.  His military \r\nspecialty was noted to be information management technician.  \r\n\r\nThe service treatment record does not reveal any complaints \r\nor findings of a psychiatric disability, including on final \r\ndischarge medical evaluation in June 1992.  Although the \r\nveteran said on VA evaluation in October 1992 that he was \r\nunder stress and had been under stress in service, no \r\npsychiatric disorder was found.  \r\n\r\nThe initial postservice evidence of a psychiatric problem was \r\nin February 2000, when mild PTSD was diagnosed.  Subsequent \r\nVA and private treatment records show continued psychiatric \r\nproblems, including several diagnoses of PTSD.  Additionally, \r\nthere are private medical reports on file which link the \r\nveteran's PTSD to his service stressors.  \r\n\r\nPhotocopies of letters from the veteran to his wife and to \r\nhis brother were added to the claims files in June 2005 and \r\nDecember 2007.  These letters, dated in 1991, talk about the \r\nPersian Gulf and contain references to beheadings and sea \r\nsnakes.  \r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\nestablishing a diagnosis of the condition, credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressors \r\nactually occurred, and a link, established by medical \r\nevidence, between the current symptomatology and the claimed \r\nin-service stressors.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2007).  \r\n\r\nWith regard to the second PTSD criterion, the evidence of an \r\nin-service stressor, the evidence necessary to establish that \r\nthe claimed stressor actually occurred varies depending on \r\nwhether it can be determined that the veteran \"engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy.\"  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West \r\n2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304.  \r\n\r\nIf it is determined through military citation or other \r\nsupportive evidence that a veteran engaged in combat with the \r\nenemy, and the claimed stressor is related to combat, the \r\nveteran's lay testimony regarding the reported stressor must \r\nbe accepted as conclusive evidence as to its actual \r\noccurrence and no further development or corroborative \r\nevidence will be necessary.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nWhere a determination is made that the veteran did not \r\n\"engage in combat with the enemy,\" or the claimed stressor \r\nis not related to combat, a veteran's lay testimony alone \r\nwill not be enough to establish the occurrence of the alleged \r\nstressor.  See Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395 (1996); \r\nDizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 166 (1996).  \r\n\r\nIn such cases, the record must contain service records or \r\nother corroborative evidence that substantiates or verifies \r\nthe veteran's testimony or statements as to the occurrence of \r\nthe claimed stressor.  See West (Carlton) v. Brown, 7 Vet. \r\nApp. 70, 76 (1994); Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 \r\n(1993).  \r\n\r\nMoreover, a medical opinion diagnosing PTSD does not suffice \r\nto verify the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  \r\nSee Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395-396 (1996); Cohen \r\nv. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 142 (1997).  \r\n\r\nThe evidence in this case does not serve to show that the \r\nveteran was engaged in combat with the enemy.  He was not \r\nawarded any medals or decorations indicative of combat, and \r\nhis military specialty, information management technician, is \r\nalso not indicative of combat.  Therefore, the provisions of \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 1154 are not applicable in this case.  \r\n\r\nIn order to establish service connection for a veteran who \r\nhad no combat experience, as here, there must be independent \r\nevidence of record to corroborate the veteran's statement as \r\nto the occurrence of a claimed stressor.  See Doran, 6 Vet. \r\nApp. at 288-89.  The veteran's lay statements alone are not \r\nenough to establish the occurrence of an alleged stressor.  \r\nSee Moreau, 9 Vet. App. at 395; Dizoglio, 9 Vet. App. at 166.  \r\n\r\nAlthough PTSD has been diagnosed, there still needs to be \r\ncredible evidence to establish the incurrence of a service \r\nstressor.  The veteran's stressors are reported as those of \r\nseeing civilians beheaded, recovering Iraqi bodies, \r\nwitnessing a soldier being blown up by a booby-trapped AK-47, \r\nand being in Saudi Arabia when there was a breach of \r\nsecurity.    \r\n\r\nAccording to a February 2005 statement from the United States \r\nArmed Services Center for Unit Records Research (USASCRUR), \r\nthe stressors provided by the veteran were unable to be \r\nverified without more specific information from the veteran, \r\nto include names and branches of service of people involved.  \r\nIt was also noted that stressors such as recovering Iraqi \r\nbodies or seeing civilians killed could not be verified.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran failed to provide more specific information \r\ndespite VA requests in September and November 2006.  \r\n\r\nThus, the Board finds that the veteran is unable to provide \r\nany specific information to aid in verification of his \r\nservice stressors, including the names and units of any \r\nperson whom he witnessed or knew who was either injured or \r\nkilled.  \r\n\r\nConsequently, despite VA's efforts to obtain sufficient \r\ninformation from the veteran to verify his claimed stressors, \r\nthe veteran is unable to provide any detailed information \r\nregarding the claimed events to warrant resubmission to the \r\nUSASCRUR for verification.  \r\n\r\nBecause the veteran has not provided sufficient evidence of \r\nservice stressors that can be verified, all of the elements \r\nneeded to support a diagnosis of PTSD have not been shown in \r\nthis case.  Hence, service connection for PTSD must be \r\ndenied.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the written statements by and on behalf of \r\nthe veteran in support of his service connection claim, lay \r\nstatements alone, including those from the veteran and his \r\nwife, are not competent evidence to establish the diagnosis \r\nof PTSD due to service.  A layperson is not competent to make \r\na determination that a particular disability is the result of \r\nservice.  Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 495 (1992); \r\nGrottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 (1993).  \r\n\r\nAlthough the veteran contends that the 1991 letters home are \r\nproof of his service stressors, the Board notes that, while \r\nthere are references to beheadings and sea snakes, the \r\nveteran does not say that he witnessed the beheadings \r\nhimself.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, he said \"[t]hey still hold public beheadings down \r\ntown here, and all are invited to come and watch these people \r\nget their heads chopped off for screwing up.\"  He did not \r\nrefer to having gone to a beheading or to being upset by \r\nthem.  Additionally, he does not report being personally \r\nthreatened by a sea snake since he sailing was in a boat.  \r\n\r\nIn summary, because all of the elements required for a \r\nfinding of service connection for PTSD are not shown, the \r\npreponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim.  \r\nConsequently, the doctrine of reasonable doubt is not for \r\napplication.

Northcutt, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active military duty from July 1966 to \r\nJune 1968.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a September 2005 rating decision.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the veteran \r\nif further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that he is entitled to service \r\nconnection for PTSD based on his combat experiences while in \r\nVietnam, which his VA psychologist reports as including an \r\nincident in which \"his landing zone was overrun,\" requiring \r\nthe use of 'beehive rounds' of ammunition, resulting in death \r\nand dismemberment of many.  VA treatment records from 2005 \r\nreflect the veteran's attendance at PTSD groups.  The \r\nveteran's treatment records since that time to the present \r\ndate should also be obtained, as they may be relevant to the \r\nadjudication of this claim.\r\n\r\nThe veteran's DD-214 discharge report indicates that the \r\nveteran served a portion of his active duty in Vietnam where \r\nhe served as a field artillery crewman.  His VA psychologist \r\nreports that the veteran served in Vietnam as a radioman in \r\nthe 1st Cavalry Division.  (The veteran's service medical \r\nrecords show Vietnam service with C Battery, 2/19th \r\nArtillery, 1st Cavalry Division).  However, the veteran's \r\nservice personnel records are not currently associated with \r\nhis claims file, and efforts to obtain them should be made.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the current record does not reflect any \r\nmeaningful effort to corroborate the veteran's claimed \r\nstressors.  The letter sent to the veteran to inform him of \r\nthe information and evidence necessary to establish his \r\nclaim, indicated that his claim was for \"post pragmatic \r\nsyndrome\" and \"post pramatia syndrome,\" and  there is no \r\nindication veteran was ever sent a stressor identification \r\nletter.  This should be accomplished.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  Obtain copies of the veteran's VA \r\ntreatment records from the Long Beach, \r\nCalifornia VA Medical Center from May 2005 \r\nforward.\r\n\r\n2.  Obtain the veteran's service personnel \r\nrecords, if available.\r\n\r\n3.  The RO should request the veteran to \r\nprovide any additional information, \r\nincluding dates, locations, names of other \r\npersons involved, etc. relating to his \r\nclaimed in-service stressors.  The veteran \r\nshould also report any details relating to \r\nhis statement that he engaged in combat. \r\nThe veteran should be advised that any \r\nadditional information would be helpful to \r\nobtain supportive evidence of the claimed \r\nstressors and that he should be specific \r\nas possible so that an adequate search for \r\ncorroborating information can be \r\nconducted.\r\n\r\n4.  Once the above requested development \r\nhas been accomplished, the RO should \r\nconduct any additional development that \r\nlogically follows, including obtaining any \r\nreports as would describe the activities \r\nof the veteran's Vietnam unit of \r\nassignment (apparently C Battery, 2/19th \r\nArtillery, 1st Cavalry Division), and \r\nconducting a VA examination.  \r\n\r\n5.  When the requested development has \r\nbeen completed, the claim should be \r\nreadjudicated.  If the claim remains \r\ndenied, provide the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative with a supplemental \r\nstatement of the case and allow an \r\nappropriate time for response.\r\n\r\nThe veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter the Board has remanded.

M. Schaefer, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from January 1955 to \r\nSeptember 1961.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in October \r\n2005 by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional \r\nOffice (RO) in Muskogee, Oklahoma.  A motion to advance the \r\nveteran's case on the docket was granted on August 1, 2008, \r\nfor good cause shown.  38 U.S.C.A. � 7107 (West 2002); 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 20.900(c) (2007).\r\n\r\nThe Board observes that, in September 2000, the veteran \r\nsuffered a cerebrovascular accident that has compromised his \r\ncompetency with regard to his appeal, and, as a result his \r\nspouse is acting in his place before VA.  A Power of \r\nAttorney, dated in June 2003, affording her such rights and \r\nresponsibilities is of record. \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that he currently suffers PTSD due to an \r\nin-service combat stressor.  The Board determines that remand \r\nis required to pursue stressor verification.\r\n\r\nThe veteran claims to have done two tours as an \"advisor\" \r\nin South Vietnam with U.S. Army Special Forces.  He contends \r\nthat, during one of these tours, his team of 15 men and \r\nanother team of 15 men engaged in an operation to destroy an \r\nammunition and supply depot in Hanoi, were then left to fight \r\ntheir way out of the jungle, and when they emerged only three \r\nmen were still alive.  The Board observes that the veteran's \r\nservice treatment records and service personnel records have \r\nbeen found to be unavailable as they were lost in the records \r\nrepository fire in St. Louis in 1973.  In addition to \r\nrequests made to NPRC, the Board notes that the record \r\nincludes requests to the National Archives and Records \r\nAdministration (NARA), the Department of the Army, and the \r\nCentral Intelligence Agency, made by the veteran, either \r\ndirectly, or through their Congressman.  For various reasons, \r\nthese requests all yielded negative responses. \r\n\r\nIn cases where VA is unable to obtain some or all of the \r\nveteran's service records, VA has a heightened duty to \r\nexplain its findings and conclusions and to consider \r\ncarefully the benefit of the doubt rule.  O'Hare v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 365, 367 (1991).  The Board's analysis \r\nof the veteran's claim has been undertaken with this duty in \r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe Board observes that in February 2008, a formal finding \r\nwas made that the veteran's stressor could not be verified.  \r\nThis finding was based, in part, on a lack of detail, such as \r\nexact dates, and the Board notes that, for most of the appeal \r\nperiod the dates provided encompassed three months in 1957 \r\nand three months in 1958, too broad a period to be the basis \r\nfor a stressor verification request.  However, in a September \r\n2007 letter, the veteran's spouse indicated that the best \r\nestimate of when the events in Hanoi occurred was during the \r\nveteran's second tour in Vietnam, in February or March 1958.  \r\nAlthough an estimation, February 1958 to March 1958 is a 60-\r\nday window that can be searched by U.S. Army and Joint \r\nServices Records Research Center (JSRRC). See M21-1MR, Part \r\nIV.ii.1.D.14.d.  She also has submitted evidence that the \r\nveteran's unit was Headquarters Company, 77th Special Forces.\r\n\r\nThe Board acknowledges a note in the claims file that JSRRC \r\nhas indicated that they would not conduct a search for \r\nrecords without the veteran's service personnel records.  As \r\nindicated, the veteran's service personnel records are \r\nunavailable, but information such as dates and unit to be \r\nsearched are now of record.  The Board finds it unreasonable \r\nto refuse to attempt verification a stressor because his \r\nservice personnel records are not of record, if the veteran \r\nhas provided a unit and approximate dates during which the \r\nstressor occurred.  Further, the Board notes that there are \r\nother sources that may be contacted for corroborative \r\ninformation in addition to JSRRC, such as NARA.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Board notes that there is a December 2005 \r\nInformal Conference Report from a meeting with a Decision \r\nReview Officer (DRO) of record, but in a June 2006 letter, \r\nthe veteran indicated that he wished to testify at a hearing.  \r\nOn his June 2006 substantive appeal, submitted just a few \r\ndays later, he responded that he did not want a Board \r\nhearing, but the Board is uncertain whether he also did not \r\nwant a hearing before a DRO.  Thus, whether the veteran \r\nwishes a DRO hearing should be clarified and, a hearing \r\nscheduled if necessary.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.\tClarify whether the veteran wishes a \r\nDRO hearing and schedule such hearing \r\nif necessary.\r\n\r\n2.\tFormulate a request to JSRRC, NARA, and \r\nany other appropriate sources for \r\nverification or corroboration of the \r\nveteran's claimed stressor regarding \r\ncombat-related activities he partook in \r\nwhile being stationed in Vietnam with \r\nHeadquarters Company, 77th Special \r\nForces, during February 1958 or March \r\n1968.  In particular, for the period \r\nfrom February to March 1968, the AMC/RO \r\nshould request a roster of personnel \r\nassigned to the 77th Special Forces, a \r\nunit history of the 77th Special Forces, \r\nand Morning Reports.  Negative \r\nresponses should be documented and \r\nincluded in the claims file.\r\n\r\n3.\tIf and only if, a claimed stressor is \r\nverified, schedule the veteran for a VA \r\nexamination to determine the existence \r\nand etiology of any PTSD.  The claims \r\nfile should be made available for \r\nreview, and the examination report \r\nshould reflect that such review \r\noccurred.  Upon examination of the \r\nveteran and review of the record, the \r\nexaminer should address the following \r\nquestion:\r\n\r\nIs it at least as likely as not (50 \r\npercent probability or greater) that \r\nthe veteran's claimed PTSD is a result \r\nof a verified in-service stressor?\r\n\r\nThe term \"as likely as not\" does not \r\nmean merely within the realm of medical \r\npossibility, but rather that the weight \r\nof medical evidence both for and \r\nagainst a conclusion is so evenly \r\ndivided that it is as medically sound \r\nto find in favor of causation or \r\naggravation as it is to find against \r\nit.\r\n\r\nA rationale for any opinion advanced \r\nshould be provided.  If an opinion \r\ncannot be formed without resorting to \r\nmere speculation, the examiner should \r\nso state and provide a reason for such \r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n4.\tAfter completing the above action and \r\nany other development as may be \r\nindicated by any response received as a \r\nconsequence of the actions taken in the \r\npreceding paragraphs, the veteran's \r\nservice connection claim should be \r\nreadjudicated, to include all evidence \r\nreceived since the February 2008 \r\nsupplemental statement of the case.  He \r\nand his representative should then be \r\nissued another supplemental statement \r\nof the case.  An appropriate period of \r\ntime should be allowed for response.\r\n\r\nThe RO/AMC is advised that this appeal \r\nhas been advanced on the Board's \r\ndocket, and thus, the remand should be \r\nprocessed with this in mind.\r\n\r\nThe veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter the Board has remanded.

Hager, Counsel\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from July 1966 to June 1968.\r\n\r\nThis appeal to the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) arises \r\nfrom a June 2004 rating decision that denied service \r\nconnection for PTSD.  The veteran filed a notice of \r\ndisagreement (NOD) in June 2005, and the RO issued a \r\nstatement of the case (SOC) in November 2005.  The veteran \r\nfiled a substantive appeal (via a VA Form 9, Appeal to the \r\nBoard of Veterans' Appeals) in January 2006.\r\n\r\nIn June 2006, the veteran testified during a Board hearing \r\nbefore the undersigned Veterans Law Judge at the RO; a \r\ntranscript of the hearing is of record.\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, the Board remanded this matter-recharacterized \r\nto include psychiatric disability other than PTSD-to the RO, \r\nvia the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, D.C., \r\nfor additional development.  After substantially complying \r\nwith the requested action (as discussed below), the AMC \r\ncontinued the denial of the claim (as reflected in an April \r\n2008 supplemental SOC (SSOC), and returned this matter to the \r\nBoard for  appellate consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  All notification and development action needed to fairly \r\nadjudicate the claim on appeal has been accomplished.\r\n\r\n2.  Although the record reflects several conclusory \r\nassessments and diagnoses of PTSD, the weight of the \r\ncompetent, probative evidence establishes that the veteran \r\ndoes not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.\r\n\r\n3.  While the record reflect diagnoses of s psychiatric \r\ndisability other than PTSD-to include schizophrenia, and \r\nsocial phobia-the medical record reflects that a psychiatric \r\ndisability was not present in service or for many years \r\nthereafter, and there is no medical evidence or opinion even \r\nsuggesting a nexus between any such disability and service.\r\n\r\n4.  The only medical opinion to address the etiology of a \r\ndiagnosed psychiatric disability other than PTSD indicates \r\nthat the veteran's social phobia with associated panic \r\nattacks and high levels of anxiety preexisted, and was not \r\naggravated by, service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for an acquired \r\npsychiatric disability, to include PTSD, are not met.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1111, 1112, 1113, 5103, 5103A, 5107(b) \r\n(West 2002 & Supp. 2007); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, \r\n3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 4.125(a) (2007).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  Duties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. \r\nNo. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (Nov. 9, 2000) (codified at \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, and 5126 \r\n(West 2002 & Supp. 2007)) includes enhanced duties to notify \r\nand assist claimants for VA benefits.  VA regulations \r\nimplementing the VCAA have been codified, as amended at \r\n38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, and 3.326(a) (2007).\r\n\r\nNotice requirements under the VCAA essentially require VA to \r\nnotify a claimant of any evidence that is necessary to \r\nsubstantiate the claim(s), as well as the evidence that VA \r\nwill attempt to obtain and which evidence he or she is \r\nresponsible for providing.  See, e.g., Quartuccio v. \r\nPrincipi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002) (addressing the duties \r\nimposed by 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)).  \r\nAs delineated in Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 \r\n(2004), after a substantially complete application for \r\nbenefits is received, proper VCAA notice must inform the \r\nclaimant of any information and evidence not of record (1) \r\nthat is necessary to substantiate the claim(s); (2) that VA \r\nwill seek to provide; (3) that the claimant is expected to \r\nprovide; and (4) must ask the claimant to provide any \r\nevidence in her or his possession that pertains to the \r\nclaim(s), in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1).\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that, effective May 30, 2008, 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.159 has been revised, in part.  See 73 Fed. Reg. 23,353-\r\n23,356 (April 30, 2008).  Notably, the final rule removes the \r\nthird sentence of 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1), which had stated \r\nthat VA will request that a claimant provide any pertinent \r\nevidence in his or her  possession.\r\n\r\nVA's notice requirements apply to all five elements of a \r\nservice connection claim: veteran status, existence of a \r\ndisability, a connection between the veteran's service and \r\nthe disability, degree of disability, and effective date of \r\nthe disability.  Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. \r\n473 (2006).\r\n\r\nVCAA-compliant notice must be provided to a claimant before \r\nthe initial unfavorable decision on a claim for VA benefits \r\nby the agency of original jurisdiction (in this case, the RO, \r\nto include the AMC).  Id.; Pelegrini, 18 Vet. App. at 112.  \r\nSee also Disabled American Veterans v. Secretary of Veterans \r\nAffairs, 327 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  However, the VCAA \r\nnotice requirements may, nonetheless, be satisfied if any \r\nerrors in the timing or content of such notice are not \r\nprejudicial to the claimant.  Id.\r\n\r\nIn this appeal, a pre-rating February 2004 letter and a post-\r\nrating July 2007 letter provided notice to the veteran \r\nregarding what information and evidence was needed to \r\nsubstantiate the claim, as well as what information and \r\nevidence must be submitted by the veteran, what information \r\nand evidence would be obtained by VA, and the need for the \r\nveteran to advise VA of and to submit any further evidence \r\nthat is relevant to the claim.  The February 2004 included a \r\nrequest for specific information regarding PTSD and an \r\nenclosed questionnaire requesting specific information \r\nregarding the veteran's claimed stressful in-service \r\nexperiences.  Each letter also included a specific request \r\nthat the veteran furnish pertinent evidence in his possession \r\n(consistent with Pelegrini and the version of 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.159 then in effect).  The July 2007 letter also informed \r\nthe veteran how disability ratings and effective dates are \r\nassigned, as well as the type of evidence that impacts those \r\ndeterminations\r\n\r\nAfter issuance of each notice described above, and \r\nopportunity for the veteran to respond, the April 2008 SSOC \r\nreflects readjudication of the claim.  Hence, while some \r\nnotice was provided to the veteran after the June 2004 \r\ninitial adjudication of the claim, the veteran is not shown \r\nto be prejudiced by the timing of VCAA-compliant notice.  See \r\nMayfield v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 537, 543 (2006); see also \r\nPrickett v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 370, 376 (2006) (the \r\nissuance of a fully compliant VCAA notification followed by \r\nreadjudication of the claim, such as in a statement of the \r\nSOC or SSOC, is sufficient to cure a timing defect).\r\n\r\nThe record also reflects that VA has made reasonable efforts \r\nto obtain or to assist in obtaining all relevant records \r\npertinent to the matter on appeal.  Pertinent objective \r\nevidence associated with the claims file consists of the \r\nveteran's service medical records, service personnel records, \r\npost-service private medical records, VA outpatient treatment \r\n(VAOPT) records and reports of VA examinations.  Also of \r\nrecord and considered in connection with the appeal are \r\nvarious written statements submitted by the veteran and by \r\nhis representative, on his behalf, as well as an August 2005 \r\nstatement of a fellow serviceman.  The Board also finds that \r\nno further RO action prior to appellate consideration of the \r\nclaim is warranted.\r\n\r\nAs regards the March 2008 VA examination conducted pursuant \r\nto the Board's June 2007 remand, the Board notes that, while \r\nthe Board instructed that the examination was to be conducted \r\nby a physician (M.D.), this examination was, in fact, \r\nperformed by a licensed psychologist with a PhD.  In the July \r\n2008 informal hearing presentation, the veteran's \r\nrepresentative, citing Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 \r\n(1998), requested a remand, asserting that this constituted a \r\nfailure to comply with the Board's June 2007 remand \r\ninstructions.  However, the March 2008 examination report was \r\nalso signed by a physician (M.D.), whose name appears at the \r\nconclusion of the report, and whose signature acknowledging \r\nreceipt of the report appears to reflect concurrence with the \r\npsychologist's conclusions.  The Board therefore finds that \r\nVA has substantially complied with the June 2007 remand \r\ndirectives, and that no further action in this regard is \r\nrequired.  See Dyment v. West, 13 Vet. App. 141, 146-47 \r\n(1999) (remand not required under Stegall v. West, where \r\nthere is substantial compliance with Board's remand \r\ninstructions).\r\n\r\nThe veteran's representative also requested remand because \r\nthe AMC only considered PTSD and not the other psychiatric \r\ndisabilities noted by the Board in its June 2007 remand.  \r\nHowever, the AMC's April 2008 SSOC correctly characterized \r\nthe issue on appeal to include psychiatric disabilities other \r\nthan PTSD, and addressed these other disabilities in the \r\nreasons and bases section of the SSOC, concluding that no \r\nnexus has been established between an acquired psychiatric \r\ndisability and military service, and that no psychosis had \r\nmanifested to a compensable degree within one year from \r\ndischarge.  Accordingly, on  these facts, remand of this \r\nmatter to the RO is unnecessary.  .\r\n\r\nIn summary, the duties imposed by the VCAA have been \r\nconsidered and satisfied.  Through various notices of the \r\nRO/AMC, the veteran has been notified and made aware of the \r\nevidence needed to substantiate this claim, the avenues \r\nthrough which he might obtain such evidence, and the \r\nallocation of responsibilities between himself and VA in \r\nobtaining such evidence.  There is no additional notice that \r\nshould be provided, nor is there any indication that there is \r\nadditional existing evidence to obtain or development \r\nrequired to create any additional evidence to be considered \r\nin connection with the claim.  Consequently, any error in the \r\nsequence of events or content of the notice is not shown to \r\nprejudice the veteran or to have any effect on the appeal.  \r\nAny such error is deemed harmless and does not preclude \r\nappellate consideration of the matter on appeal, at this \r\njuncture.  See Mayfield, 20 Vet. App. at 543 (rejecting the \r\nargument that the Board lacks authority to consider harmless \r\nerror and affirming that the provision of adequate notice \r\nfollowed by a readjudication \"cures\" any timing problem \r\nassociated with inadequate notice or the lack of notice prior \r\nto an initial adjudication).  See also ATD Corp. v. Lydall, \r\nInc., 159 F.3d 534, 549 (Fed. Cir. 1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  Analysis\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for disability \r\nresulting from personal injury or disease contracted in line \r\nof duty, or for aggravation of a pre-existing injury suffered \r\nor disease contracted in line of duty.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 \r\n(West 2002 & Supp. 2007); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (2007).  Service \r\nconnection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after \r\ndischarge from service when all the evidence, including that \r\npertinent to service, establishes that the disease was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d) (2007).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � \r\n4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between \r\ncurrent symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the in-service stressor occurred.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2007).\r\n\r\nIn his written statements and his Board hearing testimony, \r\nthe veteran claimed that he has PTSD as a result of the \r\nfollowing experiences in Vietnam: driving a jeep through the \r\nstreets of Nha Trang at night; coming under fire during the \r\nTet offensive; flying as a courier in airplanes; and training \r\nto use an M-14 rifle.\r\n\r\nAs indicated above, the first requirement for service \r\nconnection for PTSD is a valid medical diagnosis of the \r\ncondition.  Diagnoses of PTSD must be rendered in accordance \r\nwith the diagnostic criteria for the condition set forth in \r\nFourth Edition of the American Psychiatric Association's \r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-\r\nIV). See 38 C.F.R. � 4.125 (indicating that VA has adopted \r\nthe nomenclature of the DSM-IV) (2007).\r\n\r\nReview of the record in this case reveals that, while some \r\nhealth care professionals indicated that the veteran had \r\nPTSD, most indicated that he did not have PTSD or did not \r\ndiagnose this disability.\r\n\r\nYork Hospital treatment records from March to April 1981 \r\nreflect that the veteran was admitted to the hospital based \r\non his bizarre behavior and discharged with a diagnosis of \r\nparanoid schizophrenia and alcohol abuse.  January 1984 to \r\nMarch 2004 treatment records from the Babylon, Long Island \r\nVet Center contain detailed notes of conversations with the \r\nveteran regarding his history and symptoms but do not contain \r\na diagnosis of PTSD.  Two VAOPT notes, dated in April and May \r\n2004, consisting of a brief recitation of presenting problem \r\nand psychiatric history, followed by a mental status \r\nexamination \"check the box\" form, contain diagnoses of \r\nPTSD, psychosis not otherwise specified, and chronic PTSD, \r\nwithout indicating the general basis for each diagnosis or a \r\nspecific incident or incident on which it was based.  A May \r\n2004 VAOPT note patient medical history (PMH) includes PTSD.  \r\nHowever,  s reflected  in April and June 2004 VAOPT notes, a \r\nVA attending psychiatrist indicated that there were no \r\nsymptoms or signs suggestive of psychosis or cognitive \r\ndefects, did not diagnose PTSD, and noted symptoms of anxiety \r\nreaction, depression, obsession, and simple phobia.\r\n\r\nIn a June 2004 VA examination report, a VA physician, after \r\nreviewing the claims file and examining the veteran, noted \r\nthe veteran's claimed stressors of flying on cargo planes and \r\nbeing at a base that was fired upon during the Tet offensive, \r\nand concluded that the veteran did not meet the DSM-IV \r\ncriteria for PTSD.  The examiner diagnosed social phobia, \r\nwith associated panic attacks and high general levels of \r\nanxiety.  A June 2004 VA examination report (prepared in \r\nconnection with the veteran's claim for nonservice-connected \r\npension benefits that was subsequently granted) contains a \r\ndiagnosis of anxiety disorder.  A September 2005 PTSD \r\nscreening was negative.  A September 2005 VA primary care \r\noutpatient treatment note reflects an assessment of PTSD with \r\nno indication of the basis for this assessment.  As  noted \r\nabove, after reviewing the claims file and examining the \r\nveteran, the March 2008  VA examiner indicated that the prior \r\ndiagnoses of PTSD were not supported by the veteran's \r\nsymptoms, and diagnosed social phobia with associated panic \r\nattacks and high levels of anxiety. \r\n\r\nThus, the only assessments and diagnoses of PTSD were not \r\nbased on the veteran's claimed stressors and did not indicate \r\nthe reasons for the conclusion that the veteran had PTSD.  By  \r\ncontrast, the two VA examiners specifically indicated that \r\nthe veteran does not have PTSD, with the June 2004 VA \r\nexaminer specifically referring to the DSM-IV criteria and \r\nthe March 2008 VA examiner discussing the prior diagnoses of \r\nPTSD, and each examiner explained the reasons for this \r\nconclusion in light of the veteran's medical history and \r\nclaimed stressors.  Moreover, the VA attending psychiatrist \r\nexplained the reasons for his conclusions, which did not \r\ninclude a diagnosis of PTSD, in the April and June 2004 VAOPT \r\nnotes.  \r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the Board finds that the medical \r\nopinions that concluded that the veteran does not have PTSD \r\nare entitled to greater weight than the conclusory \r\nassessments and diagnoses of PTSD.  See Gabrielson v. Brown, \r\n7 Vet. App. 36, 40 (1994) (greater weight may be placed on \r\none physician's than another's depending on factors such as \r\nthe reasoning employed by the physicians and whether or not \r\n(and the extent to which) they reviewed prior clinical \r\nrecords and other evidence); Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. \r\n444, 448-49 (2000) (factors for assessing the probative value \r\nof a medical opinion include the physician's access to the \r\nclaims file and the thoroughness and detail of the opinion); \r\nHernandez- Toyens v. West, 11 Vet. App. 379, 382 (1998) (the \r\nfailure of the physician to provide a basis for his opinion \r\ngoes to the weight or credibility of the evidence in the \r\nadjudication of the merits); Miller v. West, 11 Vet. App. \r\n345, 348 (1998) (a bare conclusion, even one reached by a \r\nhealth care professional, is not probative without a factual \r\npredicate in the record).\r\n\r\nAs the preponderance of the competent evidence establishes \r\nthat the first criterion for service connection for PTSD-a  \r\nmedical diagnosis of the condition-has not been met, service \r\nconnection for PTSD cannot be established, and the Board need \r\nnot address the remaining criteria for service connection for \r\nPTSD.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2007).  \r\n\r\nThe Board further notes that, while the record reflects \r\ndiagnoses of a psychiatric disability other than PTSD-to \r\ninclude schizophrenia and social phobia-there simply is no \r\ncompetent evidence of a nexus between any such disability and \r\nservice.  \r\n\r\nThere is a single notation in the service medical records \r\nindicating that the veteran was seen for a psychiatric \r\nconsultation, and that a certificate was written and sent to \r\nhis unit.  However, the June 1968 separation examination \r\nreport reflects that the psychiatric examination was normal.  \r\nThus, there is no evidence of a psychiatric disability in \r\nservice.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the first evidence of a psychiatric disability is \r\nreflected in the above-noted March to April 1981 York \r\nHospital records, which include diagnoses of paranoid \r\nschizophrenia and alcohol abuse.  While the March 2008 VA \r\nexaminer conclusion that the diagnosis of schizophrenia, was \r\nerroneous, even if true, the first diagnosis was 19 years \r\nafter service, and, thus, well outside the presumptive period \r\nfor a psychosis.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137 \r\n(West 2002); 38 C.F.R. ��  3.307, 3.309 (2008).  The Board \r\npoints out that the passage of many years between discharge \r\nfrom active service and documentation of a claimed disability \r\nis a factor that weighs against any claim for service \r\nconnection.  See Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. \r\nCir. 2000) \r\n\r\nIt is also significant to note that none of the above-\r\ndiscussed evidence containing diagnoses of psychiatric \r\ndisabilities includes any comment even suggesting that any \r\nsuch disability is related to the veteran's service, and \r\nneither the veteran nor his representative has presented or \r\nidentified any such existing medical evidence or opinion.  \r\n\r\nTowards the end of the June 2006 Board hearing, the veteran's \r\nrepresentative argued that, based on the veteran's statements \r\nto Vet Center and VA personnel, as well as his hearing \r\ntestimony, he may have had a pre-existing psychological \r\ndeficiency was aggravated by service.  See Transcript, pp. \r\n18-19.  However, there simply is no competent evidence to \r\nsupport any such assertion. \r\n\r\nIn this regard, the Board notes that every person employed in \r\nthe active military, naval, or air service shall be taken to \r\nhave been in sound condition when examined, accepted and \r\nenrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or \r\ndisorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance \r\nand enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence \r\ndemonstrates that the injury or disease existed before \r\nacceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such \r\nservice.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1111 (West 2002 & Supp. 2007).\r\n\r\nIn July 2003, the VA General Counsel issued a precedent \r\nopinion holding that to rebut the presumption of soundness in \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 1111, VA must show by clear and unmistakable \r\nevidence both that the disease or injury existed prior to \r\nservice and that the disease or injury was not aggravated by \r\nservice.  See VAOPGCPREC 3-2003 (July 16, 2003). The claimant \r\nis not required to show that the disease or injury increased \r\nin severity during service before VA's duty under the second \r\nprong of this rebuttal standard attaches.  Id.  See also \r\nWagner v. Principi, 370 F. 3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\r\n\r\nIn this case, no defects were noted in the April 1966 pre-\r\ninduction examination report, and the veteran is therefore \r\npresumed to have been in sound condition when he entered \r\nservice.  \r\n\r\nHowever the statements of the veteran, including during the \r\nBoard hearing and to the March 2008 VA examiner, indicate \r\nthat he had psychiatric difficulties prior to service that \r\nresulted in truancy, expulsion from school, and other \r\nproblems.  See, e.g., Hearing transcript, pp. 3-4.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, the only opinion to address as to the whether the \r\nveteran had a psychiatric disability that preexisted service \r\nand whether such disability was aggravated by service is that \r\nof the March 2008 VA examiner, who as noted, reviewed the \r\nclaims file and examined the veteran, and diagnosed social \r\nphobia with associated panic attacks and high general levels \r\nof anxiety.  The examiner concluded that the veteran's social \r\nphobia and panic attacks were present prior to service and \r\nwere not likely caused or permanently aggravated by his \r\nmilitary service.  The examiner based this conclusion on the \r\nfact that the veteran indicated that he had worked at a \r\nvariety of jobs after service but had spent five months \r\nsequestered at home prior to service (thus indicating that \r\nhis psychiatric condition was no worse after service than it \r\nhad been before service).  Therefore, as the March 2008 VA \r\nexaminer explained the reasons for his conclusion in light of \r\nthe evidence of record including the veteran's statements to \r\nhim during the examination, his opinion is entitled to \r\nsubstantial weight.  See Gabrielson, 7 Vet. App. at 40; \r\nPrejean, 13 Vet. App. at  448-49.  Moreover,  no contrary \r\nopinion  on this point has been presented or identified.  \r\n\r\nThe Board therefore finds that there is clear and \r\nunmistakable evidence that the veteran's social phobia with \r\nassociated panic attacks and high levels of anxiety \r\npreexisted service and were not aggravated thereby, thus \r\nrebutting the presumption of sound condition with regard to \r\nthis disability, and indicating that it is not related to \r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe Board also notes that the veteran was diagnosed with \r\nalcohol abuse in the March to April 1981 York hospital \r\nrecords, and alcohol abuse was also indicated in the Vet \r\nCenter records.  In addition, the March 2008 VA examiner \r\nindicated that the veteran's alcohol dependence was at least \r\nas likely as not the result of service, in particular \r\nconstant enforced contact with other service members, and \r\nrepresented an attempt to medicate his heightened anxiety.  \r\nHowever, the veteran stated to the June 2004 and March 2008 \r\nVA examiners that he stopped drinking in 1983 or 1984, and \r\nthe March 2008 VA examiner diagnosed alcohol dependence in \r\nsustained remission.  Thus, to the extent that secondary \r\nservice connection may be granted for disabilities resulting \r\nfrom alcohol abuse or dependence (see Allen v. Principi, 237 \r\nF.3d 1368, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001), there is no evidence that, \r\nat any time since he filed his claim), the veteran has had a \r\ndisability due to alcohol dependence that was caused by \r\nservice, and there is therefore no basis for a grant of \r\nservice connection on this basis.  See McClain v. Nicholson, \r\n21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007) (the requirement of the \r\nexistence of a current disability is satisfied when a veteran \r\nhas a disability at the time he files his claim for service \r\nconnection or during the pendency of that claim).\r\n\r\nAs a final point, the Board notes that, in addition to the \r\nmedical evidence, in adjudicating this claim, the Board has \r\nconsidered the assertions of the veteran, his representative, \r\nand a fellow serviceman who wrote in an August 2005 letter \r\nabout the veteran's stressful Vietnam experiences and \r\nconcluded that his social anxiety and panic attacks are \r\nrelated to these experiences.  However, none of this evidence \r\nprovides a basis for allowance of the claim.  As none of the \r\nabove mentioned individuals is  shown to be other than a \r\nlayperson without the appropriate medical training and \r\nexpertise, none is competent to render a probative opinion on \r\na medical matter, such as whether the veteran's symptoms meet \r\nthe diagnostic criteria for PTSD in accordance with DSM- IV \r\nor whether any acquired psychiatric other than PTSD is \r\nmedically related to service.   See, e.g., Bostain v. West, \r\n11 Vet. App. 124, 127 (1998), citing Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 \r\nVet. App. 492 (1992).  See also Routen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. \r\n183, 186 (1997) (\"a layperson is generally not capable of \r\nopining on matters requiring medical knowledge\").  Hence, the \r\nlay assertions in this regard have no probative value.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the claim for service connection \r\nfor an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD and \r\nsocial phobia, must be denied.  In reaching this conclusion, \r\nthe Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-\r\nthe-doubt doctrine.  However, as the preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against the veteran's claim, that doctrine is not \r\napplicable.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b) (West 2002 & Supp. \r\n2007); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102 (2007); Gilbert v.

Gielow, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from June 1943 to February \r\n1946.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) \r\nfrom a rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs \r\n(VA) Regional Office (RO) in  \r\nNashville, Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy.\r\n\r\n2.  The evidence of record does not corroborate the veteran's \r\nclaimed in-service stressors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by active service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107 (West 2002); 38 \r\nC.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304(f), 4.125 (2007).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nUnder the relevant laws and regulations, service connection \r\nmay be granted for a disability resulting from disease or \r\ninjury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131 (West 2002).  If a chronic disease is \r\nshown in service, subsequent manifestations of the same \r\nchronic disease at any later date, however remote, may be \r\nservice connected, unless clearly attributable to \r\nintercurrent causes.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b) (2007).  However, \r\ncontinuity of symptoms is required where a condition in \r\nservice is noted but is not, in fact, chronic or where a \r\ndiagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned.  38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.303(b) (2007).\r\n\r\nFurther, service connection may also be granted for any \r\ndisease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, \r\nincluding that pertinent to service, establishes that the \r\ndisease was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1113(b) (West \r\n2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d) (2007).  The Board must determine \r\nwhether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative \r\nequipoise, with the appellant prevailing in either case, or \r\nwhether the preponderance of the evidence is against the \r\nclaim, in which case, service connection must be denied.  \r\nGilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\nIn order to establish service connection for PTSD, the \r\nevidence of record must include a medical diagnosis of the \r\ncondition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a), a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence, between current symptoms and \r\nan in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that \r\nthe claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f).  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) require \r\nthat a diagnosis of a mental disorder conform to the \r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).  \r\n\r\nAs set forth under DSM-IV, a valid diagnosis of PTSD requires \r\nthat a person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which \r\nboth of the following were present: \r\n(1) the person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with \r\nan event or events that involved actual or threatened death \r\nor serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of \r\nhimself or others, and (2) the person's response involved \r\nintense fear, helplessness, or horror.\r\n\r\nThe law provides that \"[i]f the evidence establishes that \r\nthe veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed \r\nstressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear \r\nand convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that \r\nthe claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, \r\nconditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the \r\nveteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of \r\nthe claimed in-service stressor.\"  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f)(1)(2007).  \r\n\r\nWhere, however, VA determines that the veteran did not engage \r\nin combat with the enemy, or that the veteran did engage in \r\ncombat with the enemy but the claimed stressor is unrelated \r\nto such combat, the veteran's lay testimony, by itself, will \r\nnot be enough to establish the occurrence of the alleged \r\nstressor.  Instead, the record must contain evidence that \r\ncorroborates the veteran's testimony as to the occurrence of \r\nthe claimed stressor.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West 2002); \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d),(f); West v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 70, 76 \r\n(1994).\r\n\r\nService connection may only be granted for a current \r\ndisability; when a claimed condition is not shown, there may \r\nbe no grant of service connection.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 \r\n(West 2002); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141 (1992) \r\n(Congress specifically limits entitlement for service-\r\nconnected disease or injury to cases where such incidents \r\nhave resulted in a disability).  \"In the absence of proof of \r\na present disability there can be no valid claim.\"  See \r\nBrammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  \r\n\r\nIn this case, the veteran alleges that he suffers from PTSD \r\ndue to witnessing \"killing and shooting\" and being \r\nsubjected to air raids by the enemy during his service in \r\nWorld War II.  Specifically, he contends that, while \r\nunloading cargo at the port or dock, enemy bombs injured and \r\nkilled members of his unit and hit and sunk a nearby supply \r\nship.      \r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, the Board notes that the veteran's \r\nservice personnel records were unavailable and appear to have \r\nbeen destroyed in a 1973 fire at the National Personnel \r\nRecords Center (NPRC) in St. Louis, Missouri.  The Board \r\nrecognizes that in such cases there is a heightened \r\nobligation to assist the appellant in the development of the \r\ncase, a heightened obligation to explain findings and \r\nconclusions, and a heightened duty to consider carefully the \r\nbenefit of the doubt rule in cases, such as in this \r\nsituation, in which records are presumed to have been or were \r\ndestroyed while the file was in the possession of the \r\ngovernment.  See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, \r\n369-70 (2005); see also Cromer v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. \r\n215, 217 (2005) (citing O'Hare v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 365, \r\n367 (1991)).  \r\n\r\nDespite the heightened duty and notwithstanding the \r\nappellant's assertions, the Board finds that his claim fails \r\nbecause his in-service stressors cannot be verified.\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the evidence shows that the veteran did \r\nnot engage in combat with the enemy.  While he has asserted \r\nthat he was subjected to enemy bomb attacks and air raids, he \r\nwas not awarded any combat medals or decorations.  Moreover, \r\nhis summary of military occupations shows that he worked \r\ncook, mainly operating in the tent kitchen but occasionally \r\ndelivering food to fellow soldiers at their posts.    \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the Board finds that the veteran did not \r\nengage in combat with the enemy within the meaning of 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1154(b).  See Gaines v. West, \r\n11 Vet. App. 353, 359 (1998).  Accordingly, his statements \r\nand testimony concerning the alleged stressors may not be \r\naccepted, standing alone, as sufficient proof of their \r\noccurrence.  Therefore, independent evidence is necessary to \r\ncorroborate his statement as to the occurrence of the claimed \r\nstressor.  Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, 288-89 (1994).  \r\n\r\nAfter a review of the claims file, the Board finds that the \r\nevidence of record does not corroborate the veteran's claimed \r\nin-service stressors.  When describing the enemy attacks and \r\nshooting incidents, the veteran was unable to identify the \r\nlocation of the events, the dates the events occurred, or \r\nnames of persons injured.  The lack of specificity renders it \r\nimpossible to verify stressors.\r\n\r\nIn July 2008, VA issued a formal finding regarding the lack \r\nof information provided by the veteran.  VA expressly \r\ndetermined that the information described was insufficient to \r\nsend to the U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research \r\nCenter (JSRRC) or to allow for meaningful research of the \r\nNational Archives and Records Administration (NARA) records.  \r\nThe Memorandum stated that all efforts to obtain the \r\nnecessary information had been exhausted and that any further \r\nattempts to obtain additional information from the veteran \r\nwould be futile.  \r\n\r\nIn Pentecost v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 124 (2002), the United \r\nStates Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) pointed \r\nout that corroboration of every detail of a stressor under \r\nsuch circumstances, such as the claimant's own personal \r\ninvolvement, is not necessary.  See also Suozzi v. Brown, 10 \r\nVet. App. 307 (1997).  However, given the absence of \r\nspecificity surrounding the shooting incidents or enemy air \r\nraids, the Board finds that the stressors cannot be verified.  \r\nAs noted above, he has not provided details regarding the \r\napproximate date, location, or persons involved for either \r\nalleged in-service stressor.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of the above, the Board finds that the in-\r\nservice stressors identified by the veteran have not been \r\nverified as is necessary to establish a claim for PTSD \r\npursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  Because the stressors \r\ncannot be verified, the Board need not reach the issue of \r\nwhether he has a current diagnosis of PTSD.  \r\n\r\nFinally, as provided for by the Veterans Claims Assistance \r\nAct of 2000 (VCAA), VA has a duty to notify and assist \r\nclaimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 \r\n& Supp. 2007); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 (as \r\namended), 3.326(a) (2007).  \r\n\r\nProper notice from VA must inform the claimant of any \r\ninformation and medical or lay evidence not of record (1) \r\nthat is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will \r\nseek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to \r\nprovide.  Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  \r\nThis notice must be provided prior to an initial unfavorable \r\ndecision on a claim by the RO.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 \r\nF.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. \r\nApp. 112 (2004).  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the notice requirements of the VCAA apply to all \r\nfive elements of a service-connection claim, including: (1) \r\nveteran status; (2) existence of a disability; (3) a \r\nconnection between the veteran's service and the disability; \r\n(4) degree of disability; and (5) effective date of the \r\ndisability.  See Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. \r\n473 (2006).  Further, this notice must include information \r\nthat a disability rating and an effective date for the award \r\nof benefits will be assigned if service connection is \r\nawarded.  Id. at 486.  \r\n\r\nVCAA notice errors are presumed prejudicial unless VA shows \r\nthat the error did not affect the essential fairness of the \r\nadjudication.  To overcome the burden of prejudicial error, \r\nVA must show (1) that any defect was cured by actual \r\nknowledge on the part of the claimant; (2) that a reasonable \r\nperson could be expected to understand from the notice what \r\nwas needed; or, (3) that a benefit could not have been \r\nawarded as a matter of law.  See Sanders v. Nicholson, 487 \r\nF.3d 881 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  \r\n\r\nHere, the VCAA duty to notify was satisfied by way of a \r\nletter sent to the veteran in February 2006 that fully \r\naddressed all notice elements and was sent prior to the \r\ninitial RO decision in this matter.  The letter informed him \r\nof what evidence was required to substantiate the claim and \r\nof his and VA's respective duties for obtaining evidence.    \r\n\r\nThere is no allegation from the veteran that he has any \r\nevidence in his possession that is needed for full and fair \r\nadjudication of this claim.  Under these circumstances, the \r\nBoard finds that the notification requirements of the VCAA \r\nhave been satisfied as to both timing and content.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Dingess requirements, in November 2006, \r\nthe RO also provided the veteran with notice of what type of \r\ninformation and evidence was needed to establish a disability \r\nrating, as well as notice of the type of evidence necessary \r\nto establish an effective date.  With that letter, the RO \r\neffectively satisfied the remaining notice requirements with \r\nrespect to the issue on appeal.  Therefore, adequate notice \r\nwas provided to the veteran prior to the transfer and \r\ncertification of his case to the Board and complied with the \r\nrequirements of 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.159(b).  \r\n\r\nNext, VA has a duty to assist the veteran in the development \r\nof the claim.  This duty includes assisting him in the \r\nprocurement of service medical records and pertinent \r\ntreatment records and providing an examination when \r\nnecessary.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A; 38 C.F.R. � 3.159.  \r\n\r\nIn determining whether the duty to assist requires that a VA \r\nmedical examination be provided or medical opinion obtained \r\nwith respect to a veteran's claim for benefits, there are \r\nfour factors for consideration.  \r\n\r\nThese four factors are:  (1) competent evidence of a current \r\ndisability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a \r\ndisability; (2) evidence establishing an in-service event, \r\ninjury, or disease, or manifestations of certain diseases \r\nduring the presumptive period; (3) an indication that the \r\ndisability or symptoms may be associated with service; and \r\n(4) whether there otherwise is sufficient competent medical \r\nevidence of record to make a decision on the claim.  \r\n38 U.S.C. � 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(4).  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the third factor above, the types of evidence \r\nthat \"indicate\" that a current disability \"may be \r\nassociated\" with service include, but are not limited to, \r\nmedical evidence that suggests a nexus but is too equivocal \r\nor lacking in specificity to support a decision on the \r\nmerits, or credible evidence of continuity of symptomatology \r\nsuch as pain or other symptoms capable of lay observation.  \r\nMcLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that all necessary development has been \r\naccomplished, and therefore appellate review may proceed \r\nwithout prejudice to the veteran.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 \r\nVet. App. 384 (1993).  \r\n\r\nIn this case, the veteran's statements as to stressors lack \r\nspecificity and cannot be verified.  By definition, the claim \r\nmust be denied because an essential element cannot be \r\nconfirmed.  Therefore, a remand for a VA examination in order \r\nto determine whether he has PTSD is not in order.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, the RO has obtained service personnel records and \r\nVA outpatient treatment records, and the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative have submitted statements on his behalf.  \r\nTherefore, the available records have been obtained in order \r\nto make an adequate determination as to this claim.  \r\n\r\nSignificantly, neither the veteran nor his representative has \r\nidentified, and the record does not otherwise indicate, any \r\nadditional existing evidence that is necessary for a fair \r\nadjudication of the claim that has not been obtained.  \r\nHence, no further notice or assistance is required to fulfill \r\nVA's duty to assist in the development of the claim.

Davitian, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from December 1984 to \r\nDecember 1987.\r\n\r\nThis case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or \r\nBoard) on appeal from a May 2004 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in \r\nAtlanta, Georgia (RO), which denied the benefit sought on \r\nappeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe competent medical evidence, overall, does not show that \r\nthe veteran's active duty caused PTSD or aggravated \r\npreexisting PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is not warranted.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n�� 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2007); \r\n38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304 (2007).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nAs provided for by the VCAA, VA has a duty to notify and \r\nassist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 \r\n& Supp. 2007); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and \r\n3.326(a) (2007).  \r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete \r\napplication for benefits, VA is required to notify the \r\nclaimant and his or her representative, if any, of any \r\ninformation, and any medical or lay evidence, that is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a); \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. \r\n183 (2002).  Proper notice from VA must inform the claimant \r\nof any information and evidence not of record (1) that is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to \r\nprovide; (3) that the claimant is expected to provide; and \r\n(4) must ask the claimant to provide any evidence in her or \r\nhis possession that pertains to the claim in accordance with \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1).  This notice must be provided prior \r\nto an initial unfavorable decision on a claim by the agency \r\nof original jurisdiction (AOJ).  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 \r\nF.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. \r\nApp. 112 (2004).  \r\n\r\nFor claims pending before VA on or after May 30, 2008, 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.159 was amended to eliminate the requirement that \r\nVA request that a claimant submit any evidence in his or her \r\npossession that might substantiate the claim.  See 73 FR \r\n23353 (Apr. 30, 2008).  \r\n\r\nHere, the VCAA duty to notify was satisfied by way of a \r\nletter sent to the appellant in June 2003 that fully \r\naddressed all necessary notice elements and was sent prior to \r\nthe initial AOJ decision in this matter.  The letter informed \r\nthe appellant of what evidence was required to substantiate \r\nthe claim and of the appellant's and VA's respective duties \r\nfor obtaining evidence.  \r\n\r\nIn Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006), the U.S. \r\nCourt of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that, upon receipt \r\nof an application for a service-connection claim, 38 U.S.C. \r\n� 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) require VA to review the \r\ninformation and the evidence presented with the claim and to \r\nprovide the claimant with notice of what information and \r\nevidence not previously provided, if any, will assist in \r\nsubstantiating, or is necessary to substantiate, each of the \r\nfive elements of the claim, including notice of what is \r\nrequired to establish service connection and that a \r\ndisability rating and an effective date for the award of \r\nbenefits will be assigned if service connection is awarded.  \r\nIn this case, although the notice provided did not address \r\neither the rating criteria or effective date provisions that \r\nare pertinent to the appellant's claim, such error was \r\nharmless given that service connection is being denied, and \r\nhence no rating or effective date will be assigned with \r\nrespect to this claimed condition.  \r\n\r\nVA has a duty to assist the veteran in the development of the \r\nclaim.  This duty includes assisting the veteran in the \r\nprocurement of service medical records and pertinent \r\ntreatment records and providing an examination when \r\nnecessary.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A; 38 C.F.R. � 3.159.  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that all necessary development has been \r\naccomplished, and therefore appellate review may proceed \r\nwithout prejudice to the appellant.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 \r\nVet. App. 384 (1993).  The RO has obtained VA and private \r\noutpatient treatment reports.  The veteran was provided an \r\nopportunity to set forth his contentions during a hearing \r\nbefore the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in June 2008.  The \r\nappellant was afforded VA medical examinations in May 2004 \r\nand April 2006.  \r\n\r\nSignificantly, neither the appellant nor his representative \r\nhas identified, and the record does not otherwise indicate, \r\nany additional existing evidence that is necessary for a fair \r\nadjudication of the claim that has not been obtained.  The \r\ntranscript of the Board hearing reflects that the record was \r\nheld open for 60 days in order to enable the veteran to \r\nobtain relevant medical records, but no such information has \r\nbeen provided to VA for consideration.  \r\n\r\nAt the time of the hearing the veteran submitted an August \r\n2007 determination by the Social Security Administration \r\n(SSA) that found him disabled as of December 2005.  The \r\ndetermination noted that the veteran had severe impairments \r\nconsisting of bipolar anxiety disorder, PTSD, and \r\ndegenerative disc disease.  The veteran also submitted some \r\ncorresponding medical records relied on by SSA.  The Board \r\nfinds that the proper adjudication of the veteran's claim \r\ndoes not require VA to obtain any additional medical records \r\nfrom SSA.  The fact that the veteran has already submitted \r\nsome of these medical records suggests that he has submitted \r\nall that he deems relevant to his claim.  He has not stated \r\nthat any outstanding medical records from SSA would be \r\nrelevant to his claim.  In addition, by their nature any \r\nmedical records submitted to SSA would address the veteran's \r\ncurrent employability, not what happened to him during \r\nservice nearly two decades earlier.  \r\n\r\nHence, no further notice or assistance to the appellant is \r\nrequired to fulfill VA's duty to assist the appellant in the \r\ndevelopment of the claim.  Smith v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 227 \r\n(2000), aff'd 281 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Dela Cruz v. \r\nPrincipi, 15 Vet. App. 143 (2001); see also Quartuccio v. \r\nPrincipi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).\r\n\r\nService Connection\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that he incurred or aggravated PTSD \r\nduring active duty.  He identifies the stressful incident as \r\nthe poor treatment he received after wrecking his car in \r\nFebruary 1987.  The veteran was accused of driving while \r\nintoxicated and injuring his passenger, another sailor.  \r\nAccordingly, when the veteran returned to ship he was not \r\ngiven any medical treatment for a week.  He had to do his \r\nusual duties although he was too injured.  Fellow sailors \r\naccused him of being drunk and crippling the passenger.  The \r\nveteran's service medical records confirm the motor vehicle \r\naccident (MVA).  \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted if the evidence \r\ndemonstrates that a current disability resulted from an \r\ninjury or disease incurred or aggravated in active military \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1131 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.303(a) (2007).  Service connection generally requires \r\nevidence of a current disability with a relationship or \r\nconnection to an injury or disease or some other \r\nmanifestation of the disability during service.  Boyer v. \r\nWest, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  A disorder may \r\nbe service-connected if the evidence of record reveals that \r\nthe veteran currently has a disorder that was chronic in \r\nservice or, if not chronic, that was seen in service with \r\ncontinuity of symptomatology demonstrated thereafter.  38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.303(b); Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 494-97 \r\n(1997).  Disorders diagnosed after discharge may still be \r\nservice-connected if all the evidence, including pertinent \r\nservice records, establishes that the disorder was incurred \r\nin service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nWhere the determinative issue involves medical causation or a \r\nmedical diagnosis, there must be competent medical evidence \r\nto the effect that the claim is plausible; lay assertions of \r\nmedical status do not constitute competent medical evidence.  \r\nGrottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 (1993); Espiritu v. \r\nDerwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 494 (1992).  When there is an \r\napproximate balance of positive and negative evidence \r\nregarding any issue material to the determination, the \r\nbenefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5107(b).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD, in particular, requires: (1) \r\nmedical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with \r\n38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV); (2) credible supporting \r\nevidence that the claimed in-service stressor(s) occurred; \r\nand (3) medical evidence establishing a link between the \r\ncurrent diagnosis and the stressor(s) in service.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, medical evidence of record raises a \r\nquestion of whether the veteran had preexisting PTSD at the \r\ntime of his enlistment.  A veteran is presumed in sound \r\ncondition except for defects noted when examined and accepted \r\nfor service.  According to 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(b), the term \r\n\"noted\" denotes only such conditions that are recorded in \r\nexamination reports.  The existence of conditions prior to \r\nservice reported by the veteran as medical history does not \r\nconstitute a notation of such conditions, but will be \r\nconsidered together with all other material evidence in \r\ndetermining the question of when a disease or disability \r\nbegan.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(b)(1).\r\n\r\nClear and unmistakable evidence that the disability existed \r\nprior to service and was not aggravated by service will rebut \r\nthe presumption of soundness.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1111; VAOPGCPREC \r\n3- 2003.  A preexisting disease will be considered to have \r\nbeen aggravated by active service where there is an increase \r\nin disability during service, unless there is a specific \r\nfinding that the increase in disability is due to the natural \r\nprogression of the disease.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1153; 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.306.\r\n\r\nThe report of the veteran's October 1984 enlistment \r\nexamination notes that his psychiatric evaluation was normal.  \r\nThe report identifies no pertinent defects or diagnoses.  The \r\nveteran denied all psychiatric complaints on his October 1984 \r\nenlistment report of medical history.  Therefore, the veteran \r\nis presumed to have been sound at entrance.\r\n\r\nBecause the presumption of soundness has attached, VA holds \r\nthe burden of proving by clear and unmistakable evidence that \r\nboth (1) the veteran's disease or injury preexisted service \r\nand (2) that such disease or injury was not aggravated by \r\nservice.  VAOGCPREC 3-03.\r\n\r\nClear and unmistakable evidence is a more formidable \r\nevidentiary burden than the preponderance of the evidence \r\nstandard.  See Vanerson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 254, 258 (1999) \r\n(noting that \"clear and convincing\" burden of proof, while a \r\nhigher standard than a preponderance of the evidence, is a \r\nlower burden to satisfy than clear and unmistakable \r\nevidence).  It is an \"onerous\" evidentiary standard, \r\nrequiring that the no-aggravation result be \"undebatable\".  \r\nCotant v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 116, 131 (2003).  Concerning \r\nclear and unmistakable evidence that the disease or injury \r\nwas not aggravated by service, the second step necessary to \r\nrebut the presumption of soundness, a lack of aggravation may \r\nbe shown by establishing that there was no increase in \r\ndisability during service or that any increase in disability \r\nwas due to the natural progress of the preexisting condition.  \r\nWagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1153.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the evidence indicates the veteran had \r\nPTSD that clearly preexisted service.  For example, a June \r\n2003 report from a private psychologist, R.R.B., Ph.D., \r\nprovides that the veteran had long-standing mood and anxiety \r\nproblems.  His anxiety and PTSD were likely from childhood.  \r\nIn a November 2004 report, Dr. R.R.B. provides that the \r\nveteran suffered from multiple severe psychiatric problems, \r\nincluding PTSD.  The veteran was the victim of significant \r\nemotional and physical abuse throughout all of his childhood.  \r\nThe report also refers to the veteran's \"childhood-based \r\nPTSD symptoms.\"  The Board notes that these detailed reports \r\nfollow and revise an April 2003 report in which Dr. R.R.B. \r\nrevealed that the veteran reported PTSD symptoms stemming \r\nfrom a service-related MVA in 1987.  \r\n\r\nSimilarly, the report of an April 2006 VA psychiatric \r\nexamination provides an Axis I diagnosis of PTSD from \r\ntraumatic childhood.  An addendum provides that the veteran's \r\nstressor that originated the PTSD diagnosis was the constant \r\nmental and physical abuse in childhood by his father.  \r\n\r\nThe Board also finds that the medical evidence of record, \r\noverall, demonstrates that the veteran's preexisting PTSD did \r\nnot undergo an increase in severity during service and was \r\nthus not aggravated by service.  \r\n\r\nIn so finding, the Board observes that the veteran's service \r\nmedical records are negative for psychiatric complaints, \r\nsymptoms, findings or diagnoses.  The report of his December \r\n1987 separation medical examination notes that his \r\npsychiatric evaluation was normal.  It identifies no \r\npertinent defects or diagnoses.  The veteran denied all \r\npsychiatric complaints on his December 1987 separation report \r\nof medical history.  \r\n\r\nThe Board recognizes that Dr. R.R.B.'s June 2003 report notes \r\nthat the veteran's childhood-based PTSD was \"severely \r\nexacerbated by experience in US Navy....\"  Dr. R.R.B.'s \r\nNovember 2004 report states that the poor treatment of the \r\nveteran after the MVA triggered very severe reenactment \r\nexperiences stemming from the veteran's childhood experience \r\nand exacerbated his childhood-based PTSD symptoms.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the Board finds it significant that Dr. R.R.B.'s \r\nreports do not identify any symptoms of such exacerbations in \r\nservice or state that they were permanent.  The Board also \r\nfinds it significant that the veteran's service medical \r\nrecords (which are negative for any psychiatric complaints, \r\nsymptoms, findings or diagnoses) document no PTSD symptoms or \r\nexacerbations.  The Board finds that the contemporary nature \r\nof the veteran's service medical records means they outweigh \r\nDr. R.R.B.'s later opinions.  \r\n\r\nThe report of a May 2004 VA psychiatric examination reflects \r\nthat the veteran denied recurrent recollection of the 1987 \r\nMVA.  He denied intense distress at exposure to a similar \r\nevent as well as physiological or psychological distress at \r\nthe exposure of any event that would resemble or remind him \r\nof the event.  He denied efforts to avoid thoughts, feeling \r\nor conversations associated with the MVA as well as efforts \r\nto avoid activities, places or people that aroused \r\nrecollection of the event.  \r\n\r\nThe addendum to the April 2006 VA psychiatric examination \r\nprovides that the 1987 inservice MVA resulted in minimal \r\naggravation of the veteran's preexisting childhood-based \r\nPTSD.  The MVA was not sufficient to alter, but momentarily, \r\nthe veteran's current Global Assessment of Functioning score \r\nof 55.  Therefore, the examiner stated that the GAF score of \r\n55 preexisted the inservice MVA and there was no lasting \r\nworsening of the problem.  The examiner stated that he based \r\nthis opinion on the records reviewed, including the May 2004 \r\nVA examination report (documenting the absence of any \r\nreference to the MVA in recollections or any other PTSD \r\nsymptoms, except nightmares) and Dr. R.R.B.'s June 2003 \r\nreport (noting that the veteran's mood and anxiety problems \r\nfrom childhood were exacerbated by his experience in the U.S. \r\nNavy). \r\n\r\nAlthough the Board does not doubt the veteran's belief that \r\nhis PTSD was incurred or aggravated during service, he is not \r\na medical professional competent to render an opinion on \r\nmatters of a medical diagnosis or the etiology of a diagnosed \r\ndisorder.  Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492 (1992).\r\n\r\nOverall, the Board finds that the evidence shows that the \r\nveteran did not incur or aggravate PTSD during active duty.  \r\nAs the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, \r\nthe benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.  \r\nSee generally Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); \r\nOrtiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nJONATHAN B.

McPhaull, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant is a veteran who served on active duty from \r\nJanuary 1974 to July 1975.  This matter is before the Board \r\nof Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2003 \r\nrating decision by the Cleveland, Ohio Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In July 2008, a Travel \r\nBoard hearing was held before the undersigned.  A transcript \r\nof the hearing is associated with the claims file.  At the \r\nhearing, the veteran was granted a 90 day abeyance period for \r\nsubmission of additional evidence; no further evidence was \r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  There is credible corroborating evidence that the veteran \r\nwas subjected to sexual abuse and mental trauma in service.\r\n\r\n2.  The veteran has a VA diagnosis of PTSD; a VA examiner has \r\nopined that the veteran's PTSD is related to the corroborated \r\nstressor events in service.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is warranted.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n�� 1110, 1131 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2008); 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.303, 3.304 (2008).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n        I. Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nThe VCAA, in part, describes VA's duty to notify and assist \r\nclaimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a).  The VCAA applies in the \r\ninstant case; however, because the benefit sought is being \r\ngranted, there is no reason to belabor its impact in this \r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n        II. Legal Criteria, Evidence and Analysis\r\n\r\nInitially, the Board notes all of the evidence in the \r\nveteran's claims file, with an emphasis on the evidence \r\nrelevant to this appeal, has been reviewed.  Although the \r\nBoard has an obligation to provide reasons and bases \r\nsupporting its decision, there is no need to discuss, in \r\ndetail, every piece of evidence of record.  Gonzales v. West, \r\n218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that VA must \r\nreview the entire record, but does not have to discuss each \r\npiece of evidence).  Hence, the Board will summarize the \r\nrelevant evidence where appropriate, and the analysis below \r\nwill focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails \r\nto show, as to the claim.\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability due to \r\ndisease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active \r\nmilitary service.  38 U.S.C.A. ��  1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.303.\r\n\r\nTo establish service connection for PTSD requires medical \r\nevidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 4.125(a) [i.e., a diagnosis under DSM-IV]; a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence, between current symptoms and \r\na stressor event in service; and credible supporting evidence \r\nthat the claimed stressor event in service occurred.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  Where the veteran did not engage in \r\ncombat with the enemy, or the claimed stressors are not \r\nrelated to combat, the veteran's testimony alone is not \r\nsufficient to establish the occurrence of the claimed \r\nstressors; they must be corroborated by credible supporting \r\nevidence.  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  \r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative \r\nevidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the \r\ndetermination of matter, the benefit of the doubt in \r\nresolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b).\r\n\r\nThe veteran's service treatment records contain no mention of \r\ncomplaints, findings, or diagnosis of PTSD.  Service \r\npersonnel records note that she requested, and was approved \r\nfor, early separation from service due to pregnancy.\r\n\r\nIn her October 2002 claim of service connection for PTSD, the \r\nappellant alleged that she was beaten and raped on numerous \r\noccasions in service, and that the Army did nothing to \r\ndiscourage it.  In her stressor statement she further \r\nreiterated that J. M., the soldier committing the abuse (and \r\nfather of her child), physically, sexually and mentally \r\nabused her, even while she was pregnant.  She stated that she \r\nwas not allowed to seek medical help while in the military \r\nbecause J. M. (who was then a married noncommissioned officer \r\nwho was superior to her) prevented it.\r\n\r\nLetters from J. M. in essence acknowledge that he gravely \r\nmistreated the veteran.  \r\n\r\nVA treatment records from November 1988 to June 2007 show \r\nongoing treatment for various psychiatric disorders to \r\ninclude PTSD.\r\n\r\nOn October 2005 VA mental health assessment, the examiner \r\nnoted the veteran's history of several pre-service rapes and \r\nassaults, and that she requested an early discharge from the \r\nmilitary in order to protect herself and her unborn child \r\nfrom her boyfriend (J.M., father of her child) who was \r\nseverely mentally, physically and sexually abusing her.  \r\nBased on history elicited and mental status evaluation, the \r\nexaminer provided an Axis I diagnosis of PTSD, and opined \r\nthat the veteran has PTSD from physical, sexual, and mental \r\nabuse she incurred while she was in the military.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran has an Axis I diagnosis of PTSD (in accordance \r\nwith DSM-IV), and receives VA treatment for such disability.  \r\nHer accounts of sexual and mental abuse in the military by a \r\nmarried noncommissioned officer are, in essence, corroborated \r\nby the fact that she bore the child of that individual, and \r\nby his letters acknowledging abuse.  A VA examiner has opined \r\nthat her diagnosis of PTSD is related to the sexual trauma \r\nand mental abuse she suffered in the military.  The Board \r\nfinds no reason in the record to question the competence of \r\nthat VA care-provider.  The Board recognizes that the veteran \r\nwas subjected to sexual abuse trauma prior to service and has \r\n(apparently) experienced abuse since.  Nevertheless, all the \r\nlegal requirements for establishing service connection for \r\nPTSD are met.  Service connection for PTSD is warranted. \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nGEORGE R.

Heneks, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from March 1976 to November \r\n1977.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA \r\nor Board) on appeal from an August 2003 rating decision of \r\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) \r\nin Louisville, Kentucky, which denied the benefit sought on \r\nappeal.  \r\n\r\nIn his substantive appeal to the Board, received in August \r\n2004, the veteran requested a travel board hearing.  In a \r\nletter to VA dated in June 2007, the veteran withdrew his \r\nrequest for a personal hearing.  38 C.F.R. � 20.704(e).  \r\nAccordingly, the Board will proceed with consideration of \r\nthis appeal based on the evidence of record.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nReason for remand:  To provide the veteran a VA examination.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that he has a psychiatric disability as \r\na result of military sexual trauma.  In his August 2002 PTSD \r\nstressor statement, the veteran alleged that he was sexually \r\nassaulted by someone he once considered a friend while \r\nstaying at this person's house.  The veteran stated that he \r\nhad a decline in his military performance following this \r\nsexual trauma and also received an Article 15.  Since his \r\ndischarge, the veteran claims that the sexual trauma has \r\ncontinued to effect his life and he cannot hold a job.  \r\n\r\nA review of the veteran's service treatment records showed \r\nthat in August 1977, the veteran was evaluated at community \r\nmental health for adjustment difficulties.  On an October \r\n1977 report of medical history, the veteran marked that he \r\nhad depression or excessive worry.  An undated report of \r\ncontact associated with the veteran's claims file between \r\nDecember 2002 and August 2003 indicated that attempts to \r\nlocate any mental health clinical records revealed that these \r\nrecords have been lost.  The service personnel records showed \r\nthat in July 1977, the veteran received an Article 15 for \r\nfailing to go at the time prescribed to his appointed place \r\nof duty.  An evaluation report for the period January 1977 to \r\nAugust 1977 had a total score of 110 and an evaluation report \r\nfor the period from September 1977 to October 1977 contained \r\na score of 95.  In October 1977, the veteran was separated by \r\nreason of dependency.  Additionally, the RO ascertained that \r\nthe veteran's alleged assailant served in the military at the \r\nsame time as the veteran.  \r\n\r\nThe medical evidence reflected that the veteran has been \r\nvariously diagnosed with bipolar disorder, schizoaffective \r\ndisorder, panic disorder, major depression with psychotic \r\nfeatures, mood disorder, adjustment disorder with anxiety, \r\nand PTSD.  A December 2003 VA treatment entry indicated that \r\nthe veteran reported being sexually abused while in the Army.  \r\nThe assessment was bipolar disorder versus schizoaffective \r\ndisorder, panic disorder, and the veteran described symptoms \r\nof PTSD.  In a September 2004 letter from the Vet Center, a \r\nsocial worker relayed that the veteran reported being \r\nsexually assaulted by a male friend, who was also a superior \r\nofficer, and did not report this incident because he was \r\nafraid of repercussions.  After the incident, the veteran \r\nrelated that his job performance declined following the event \r\nand that he discontinued his military service to care for his \r\nill father.  The social worker did not provide a diagnosis.  \r\nThe veteran is currently on Social Security disability with a \r\ndisability onset date of March 2001 for affective (mood) \r\ndisorders.  \r\n\r\nIn February 2005, the veteran's mental health care provider \r\nopined that the veteran's diagnoses of post traumatic stress \r\ndisorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, and \r\nmood disorder were related to an in-service sexual trauma.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran has not had an examination in connection with his \r\nclaim.  The case of McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 \r\n(2006), held that an examination is required when (1) there \r\nis evidence of a current disability, (2) evidence \r\nestablishing an \"in-service event, injury or disease,\" or a \r\ndisease manifested in accordance with presumptive service \r\nconnection regulations occurred which would support \r\nincurrence or aggravation, (3) an indication that the current \r\ndisability may be related to the in-service event, and (4) \r\ninsufficient evidence to decide the case.  The United States \r\nCourt of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has stated that \r\n\"VA has provided special evidentiary development procedures, \r\nincluding the interpretation of behavioral changes by a \r\nclinician and interpretation in relation to a medical \r\ndiagnosis\" with regard to personal assault cases.  Patton v. \r\nWest, 12 Vet. App. 272 (1999) (citing VA Adjudication \r\nProcedure Manual M 21-1 Part III, paragraph 5.14(c)).  In \r\nthis regard, the veteran alleges that his performance \r\ndeclined following the sexual assault and there is an opinion \r\nrelating the alleged in-service sexual trauma to several of \r\nthe veteran's psychiatric disabilities.  However, the \r\nveteran's mental health care provider did not provide much \r\ndetail to support his conclusions.  As such, the Board finds \r\nthat an examination is necessary before a decision can be \r\nreached on this claim.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should arrange for the veteran \r\nto undergo a VA psychiatric examination by \r\nan examiner with appropriate expertise to \r\ndetermine the nature, extent and etiology \r\nof the veteran's psychiatric disability or \r\ndisabilities, to include bipolar disorder, \r\ndepressive disorder, mood disorder, and \r\nPTSD, if found to be present.  The \r\nexaminer should render all applicable \r\npsychiatric diagnoses.  All indicated \r\nstudies should be performed, to include \r\npsychological testing if appropriate, and \r\nall findings should be reported in detail.  \r\nThe veteran's claims file, including a \r\ncopy of this remand, must be made \r\navailable to and reviewed by the examiner.  \r\nThe examination report is to reflect that \r\nsuch a review of the claims file was made.  \r\n\r\nIn reviewing the veteran's claims file, \r\nthe examiner should identify and examine \r\nall records including the performance \r\nevaluations, July 1977 Article 15, August \r\n1977 record which showed he was evaluated \r\nby mental health for an adjustment \r\ndisorder, October 1977 report of \r\ndepression/excessive worry, as well as all \r\npost-service medical evidence to the \r\nclaimed sexual trauma alleged by the \r\nveteran to have occurred during active \r\nservice, and offer an opinion as to the \r\nclinical significance, if any, of such \r\nevidence in light of the veteran's \r\npsychiatric diagnoses and whether, under \r\nsuch circumstances, such are sufficient \r\nevidence of an actual stressor.  The \r\nexaminer should then express an opinion as \r\nto whether it is at least as likely as not \r\n(at least a 50 percent probability) that \r\nthe veteran has a psychiatric disability, \r\nto include bipolar disorder, depressive \r\ndisorder, mood disorder, and PTSD, as a \r\nresult of the stressful event.  \r\n\r\nA complete rationale must be given for any \r\nopinion expressed, and the foundation for \r\nall conclusions should be clearly set \r\nforth.  If the examiner is unable to give \r\nan opinion without resorting to \r\nspeculation, the report should so state.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran is hereby advised that failure \r\nto report for a scheduled VA examination \r\nwithout good cause shown may have adverse \r\neffects on this claim.\r\n\r\n2.  Thereafter, the RO should readjudicate \r\nthe issue of entitlement to service \r\nconnection for a psychiatric disability, \r\nto include bipolar disorder, depressive \r\ndisorder, mood disorder, and PTSD.  If the \r\nissue on appeal remains denied, a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case should \r\nbe provided to the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative.  After the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative have had an adequate \r\nopportunity to respond, the appeal should \r\nbe returned to the Board for appellate \r\nreview.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2008).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nKATHLEEN K.

P. Simpson, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from September 1967 to June \r\n1970.\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from a July 2004 rating decision of the Atlanta, \r\nGeorgia, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office \r\n(RO), which denied entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD.\r\n\r\nIn November 2008, the veteran testified at a personal hearing \r\nbefore the undersigned Veterans Law Judge.  A transcript of \r\nthat hearing has been associated with the claims file.  The \r\nveteran had perfected an appeal for a claim of entitlement to \r\nservice connection for peripheral vascular disease.  At the \r\nNovember 2008 hearing, the veteran submitted a written \r\nstatement, indicating he wanted to withdraw that claim from \r\nthe appeal.  Thus, that claim is no longer part of the \r\ncurrent appellate review.  See 38 C.F.R. � 20.204 (2008).\r\n\r\nAlso at the hearing, the veteran submitted additional \r\nevidence along with a waiver of initial consideration by the \r\nagency of original jurisdiction.  Thus, the Board may \r\nconsider this evidence in the first instance.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 20.1304(c) (2008).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  PTSD was not diagnosed in service.\r\n\r\n2.  The veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy \r\nduring military service.  \r\n\r\n3.  The veteran has not been diagnosed with PTSD based on an \r\nindependently verified in-service stressor.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2008); \r\n38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304(f) (2008).   \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act\r\n\r\nThe requirements of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of \r\n2000 (VCAA) have been met.  There is no issue as to providing \r\nan appropriate application form or completeness of the \r\napplication.  VA notified the veteran in correspondence dated \r\nin January and February 2004 of the information and evidence \r\nneeded to substantiate and complete a claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD, to include notice of what part of that \r\nevidence is to be provided by the claimant, notice of what \r\npart VA will attempt to obtain, and the need for the veteran \r\nto provide specific information regarding his in-service \r\nstressors.  VA did fail to provide notice how disability \r\nevaluations and effective dates are assigned prior to initial \r\nconsideration of the claim.  See Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 \r\nVet. App. 473, 484 (2006).  The record, however, shows that \r\nany prejudice that failure caused was harmless, as the \r\npreponderance of the evidence is against entitlement to \r\nservice connection for PTSD.  Thus, any questions as to the \r\nappropriate disability rating or effective date to be \r\nassigned are moot.\r\n\r\nVA fulfilled its duty to assist the claimant in obtaining \r\nidentified and available evidence needed to substantiate the \r\nclaims including VA medical records and records relied upon \r\nby the Social Security Administration in granting the veteran \r\ndisability benefits.  VA also submitted the veteran's in-\r\nservice stressors to the proper agency in an attempt to \r\nverify them.  VA did not provide the veteran with an \r\nexamination in connection with his claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD.  The Board finds that an examination was \r\nnot necessary to decide the merits of this claim.  \r\n\r\nUnder the VCAA, VA is obliged to provide an examination when \r\nthe record contains competent evidence that the claimant has \r\na current disability or signs and symptoms of a current \r\ndisability; the record indicates that the disability or signs \r\nand symptoms of disability may be associated with active \r\nservice; and the record does not contain sufficient \r\ninformation to make a decision on the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(4).  \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the threshold for the duty to provide an \r\nexamination is rather low.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. \r\nApp. 79 (2006).  Here, however, the evidence of record is \r\nsufficient to decide the claim for service connection for \r\nPTSD.  While the veteran has a valid diagnosis of PTSD, the \r\nin-service stressors alleged by the veteran have not been \r\nverified.  As a noncombat veteran, his statements alone \r\ncannot establish the existence of a stressor.  See Moreau v. \r\nBrown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395 (1996);  Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 \r\nVet. App. 163, 166 (1996).  As stated above, VA submitted the \r\nveteran's in-service stressors to the proper agency for \r\nverification, and it was unable to verify the stressors the \r\nveteran has described.  Without a corroborated stressor, \r\nthere is no reason for VA to provide an examination or obtain \r\nan opinion in connection with this claim.\r\n\r\nThere is not a scintilla of evidence that any VA error in \r\nnotifying or assisting the appellant reasonably affects the \r\nfairness of this adjudication.  Indeed, the appellant has not \r\nsuggested that such an error, prejudicial or otherwise, \r\nexists.  Hence, the case is ready for adjudication.  \r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nAt the November 2008 hearing before the undersigned, the \r\nveteran's representative argued that an amendment to the \r\nprovisions of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), which addresses the \r\nevidence necessary to establish a claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD, applied to the veteran's claim because \r\nhe had been diagnosed with PTSD during service.  It was \r\nalleged that when the veteran first landed in Vietnam in \r\nFebruary 1968 at the airport in Tan Son Nhut, his unit \r\nreceived incoming fire.  The veteran elaborated on this \r\nstating that they landed in Vietnam in a civilian airplane \r\nand were receiving incoming rocket and mortar attacks.  He \r\nstated this occurred in February 1968.  The representative \r\nstated that such stressors had been verified.  The veteran \r\nstated he was in Cam Ranh Bay in March 1968 and received \r\nincoming fire at that location as well.  He denied witnessing \r\nanyone being injured or killed during those attacks, but \r\nnoted the attacks were not far from him.\r\n\r\nThe veteran testified that he was seen in service by a \r\npsychiatrist and was diagnosed with battle fatigue.  He \r\nstated it was suggested he receive a medical discharge.  He \r\nnoted he went absent without leave due to medical problems \r\nhis wife was having.  The veteran felt that the military had \r\nnot been understanding as to his wife's medical problems and \r\ndenied him leave.  \r\n\r\nThe Board has reviewed all the evidence in the veteran's \r\nclaims file, which includes his written contentions, his \r\ntestimony, service treatment records, Social Security \r\nAdministration records, and VA medical records.  Although the \r\nBoard has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases \r\nsupporting this decision, there is no requirement that the \r\nevidence submitted by the veteran or obtained on his behalf \r\nbe discussed in detail.  Rather, the Board's analysis below \r\nwill focus specifically on what evidence is needed to \r\nsubstantiate the claim and what the evidence in the claims \r\nfile shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claim.  See \r\nGonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000).\r\n\r\nService connection is warranted where the evidence of record \r\nestablishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in \r\ndisability was incurred in the line of duty in the active \r\nmilitary service or, if pre-existing such service, was \r\naggravated thereby. 38 U.S.C.A. � 1110; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  \r\nService connection may also be warranted for any disease \r\ndiagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including \r\nthat pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � \r\n4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between \r\nthe current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor \r\noccurred.  If the evidence establishes that the veteran \r\nengaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is \r\nrelated to that combat, in the absence of clear and \r\nconvincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the \r\nclaimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, \r\nconditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the \r\nveteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of \r\nthe claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nIn October 2008, VA amended the provisions of 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f) by eliminating the requirement of evidence \r\ncorroborating occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor \r\nin claims in which PTSD is diagnosed in service.  73 Fed. \r\nReg. 64208 (Oct. 2008).\r\n\r\nWhere a determination is made that the veteran did not \r\n\"engage in combat with the enemy,\" or the claimed stressor \r\nis not related to combat, the veteran's lay testimony alone \r\nwill not be enough to establish the occurrence of the alleged \r\nstressor.  See Moreau, 9 Vet. App. at 395; Dizoglio, 9 Vet. \r\nApp. at 166.  In such cases, the record must contain service \r\nrecords or other credible evidence that supports and does not \r\ncontradict the veteran's testimony.  See Doran v. Brown, 6 \r\nVet. App. 283, 289 (1994).\r\n\r\nService connection generally requires evidence of a current \r\ndisability with a relationship or connection to an injury or \r\ndisease or some other manifestation of the disability during \r\nservice.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. \r\n2000); Mercado-Martinez v. West, 11 Vet. App. 415, 419 (1998) \r\n(citing Cuevas v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 542, 548 (1992)).  \r\nWhere the determinative issue involves medical causation or a \r\nmedical diagnosis, there must be competent medical evidence \r\nto the effect that the claim is plausible; lay assertions of \r\nmedical status do not constitute competent medical evidence.  \r\nEspiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 494 (1992).\r\n\r\nAfter having carefully reviewed the evidence of record, the \r\nBoard finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against \r\nthe grant of service connection for PTSD.  The reasons \r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThe veteran asserts that he was diagnosed with PTSD in \r\nservice.  He bases this assertion on the fact that a VA \r\nexaminer reviewed his service treatment and personnel records \r\nand opined that the symptoms the veteran exhibited in service \r\nwere indicative of PTSD.  See November 13, 2008 letter from \r\nDr. JW.  The Board disagrees that he was diagnosed with PTSD \r\nin service and finds that the amendment to 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f) does not apply to the veteran's claim.  \r\n\r\nThe intent of the amendment was to assist veterans who had \r\nactually been diagnosed with PTSD while in service.  See \r\n72 Fed. Reg. 64208 (Oct. 2008).  There is no suggestion that \r\nthe amendment was to assist those who are retrospectively \r\ndiagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder after service.  \r\nIn providing its rationale for the amendment, VA stated the \r\nfollowing, in part:\r\n\r\nVA has found, based on claims submitted \r\nsince September 11, 2001, that service \r\nmembers are increasingly being diagnosed \r\nwith PTSD while still in service, rather \r\nthan after discharge from service.  The \r\nincreased incidence of in-service \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD is attributable to \r\nadvances in medicine and increased \r\nmonitoring of service members' mental \r\nhealth by the service departments.  Given \r\nthe ability to more quickly diagnose PTSD \r\nand the proximity between an in-service \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD and the claimed \r\noccurrence of the stressor, VA no longer \r\nbelieves it is necessary to require \r\nevidence corroborating occurrence of the \r\nstressor in claims based on an in-service \r\ndiagnosis.\r\n\r\nId. at page 64209 (Emphasis added).  \r\n\r\nThe veteran's service treatment records do not show a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD.  An after-the-fact diagnosis of PTSD 40 \r\nyears after discharge from service is not an in-service \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD in service.  The Board does not agree with \r\nthe veteran that the after-the-fact diagnosis of PTSD meets \r\nthe amended provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  For these \r\nreasons, the Board finds that the VA examiner's postservice \r\nopinion does not constitute an in-service diagnosis of PTSD.  \r\nThe fact that there is no diagnosis of PTSD in service is \r\nnot, however, outcome determinative.\r\n\r\nThe veteran provided VA with a statement detailing his in-\r\nservice stressors in April 2007.  He stated he arrived in Tan \r\nSon Nhut Air Force base on February 12, 1968, while the base \r\nwas being mortared and rocketed.  He stated they boarded \r\nbuses from the airport while incoming rounds were hitting the \r\nrunway and went to the 90th Replacement Company.  The veteran \r\nstated they received incoming rocket attacks on February 13, \r\n1968 as well.  Reportedly, on the third night, the \"ammo \r\nbunker was destroyed.\"  The veteran stated he arrived in Cam \r\nRanh Bay Air Base approximately on February 17, 1968, and \r\nthey received incoming rounds.  The veteran also stated that \r\nfrom April to October 1969, he was with the \"HHHC\" 18th \r\nEngineer Brigade, during which time he picked up damaged \r\nequipment and wounded/dead soldiers.  \r\n\r\nIn December 2007, VA sent the veteran's stressor statements \r\nand his personnel file to the U.S. Army & Joint Services \r\nRecords Research Center (JSSRC)  In the response, the JSSRC \r\nindicated that it was able to verify that Tan Son Nhut \r\nreceived incoming mortar, rocket, or ground attacks before \r\nthe veteran's arrival in February 1968 and after his \r\ndeparture later that month, but not on the dates provided by \r\nthe appellant.  Moreover, the JSSRC noted that The Center for \r\nMilitary History indicated that the 31st Supply Company to \r\nwhich the veteran was attached was in Cam Ranh Bay during \r\nthat period, and thus it was unable to place the veteran's \r\nsupply company at Tan Son Nhut.  While Cam Ranh Bay Air Base \r\nwas attacked in March 1968, there was no reported damage or \r\ninjuries to personnel.  \r\n\r\nThe Board concludes that the veteran's stressors have not \r\nbeen corroborated, or if they have been, that stressor has \r\nnot been the basis for a diagnosis of post traumatic stress \r\ndisorder.  While the veteran claims to have been in Tan Son \r\nNhut, there is no documentation to substantiate the \r\nallegation that the airbase was attacked while he was there, \r\nto include lay statements from someone who served with him.  \r\nThus, the Board does not find that the veteran engaged in \r\ncombat.  Hence, his statements alone are not be enough to \r\nestablish the occurrence of the alleged stressors.  See \r\nMoreau, 9 Vet. App. at 395; Dizoglio, 9 Vet. App. at 166.  \r\n\r\nWhile the veteran at his November 2008 hearing stated that he \r\nwas in Cam Ranh Bay in March 1968 when it received incoming \r\nmortar rounds, a review of the evidence of record shows that \r\nthe appellant has never been diagnosed with post traumatic \r\nstress disorder based on this March 1968 stressor standing \r\nalone.  Indeed, the Board can find no reference to this March \r\n1968 stressor in any clinical record.  As a result, the Board \r\ndoes not find a basis to grant service connection. \r\n\r\nWhile the veteran has been diagnosed with post traumatic \r\nstress disorder, such diagnosis is not based upon an \r\nindependently-verified stressor.  Because the diagnosis of \r\nPTSD is based on an unconfirmed stressor, service connection \r\nfor PTSD cannot be granted.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Board finds that the preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against the veteran's claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD; hence, the reasonable doubt doctrine is \r\nnot applicable.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  \r\nConsequently, the claim must be denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_______________________________________\r\nDEREK R.

Hennings, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from March 1967 to February \r\n1970, including service in the Republic of Vietnam.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a an April 1999 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nNew Orleans, Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThe Board remanded the case for additional development in \r\nJanuary 2001 and October 2004.  The appeal has been returned \r\nto the Board for further appellate action.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran seeks service connection for PTSD.  Service \r\nconnection for PTSD currently requires: (1) medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � \r\n4.125(a); (2) a link, established by medical evidence, \r\nbetween current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and (3) \r\ncredible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service \r\nstressor occurred.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2008).  \r\n\r\nIf the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to \r\nthat combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence \r\nto the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is \r\nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone \r\nmay establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service \r\nstressor.  In Pentecost v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 124 (2002), \r\nthe Veteran in that case, who had a non-combat military \r\noccupational specialty (MOS), claimed that he was exposed to \r\nrocket attacks while stationed at Da Nang.  Records for the \r\nVeteran's unit corroborated the Veteran's assertion that \r\nenemy rocket attacks occurred during the time he was \r\nstationed at Da Nang, but did not document his personal \r\nparticipation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \r\n(Court) in that case determined that the Veteran's presence \r\nwith his unit at the time the attacks occurred corroborated \r\nhis statement that he experienced such attacks personally.  \r\nCiting Suozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307 (1997), the Court \r\nconcluded that the Board erred in interpreting the \r\ncorroboration requirement too narrowly by requiring the \r\nVeteran to corroborate his actual proximity to and \r\nparticipation in the rocket attacks on Da Nang.  Id. at 128- \r\n29.\r\n\r\nThe evidence required to support the occurrence of an in-\r\nservice stressor for PTSD varies \"depending on whether or not \r\nthe Veteran was 'engaged in combat with the enemy'. . . . \r\nWhere . . . VA determines that the Veteran did not engage in \r\ncombat with the enemy . . . the Veteran's lay testimony, by \r\nitself, will not be enough to establish the occurrence of the \r\nalleged stressor.\"  See Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 \r\n(1993).  Requisite additional evidence may be obtained from \r\nsources other than the Veteran's service medical records.  \r\nSee Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395 (1996), aff'd, 124 \r\nF.3d 228 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (table); see also Dizoglio v. \r\nBrown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 166 (1996); Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. \r\nApp. 283 (1994); Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. at 98.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he currently has PTSD as a result \r\nof exposure to several in-service stressors, including his \r\nbase being exposed to enemy rocket and mortar attacks and \r\nseeing a man who had his throat slashed and/or his head cut \r\noff because he fell asleep while on guard duty.  \r\n\r\nThe Board has reviewed the Veteran's service personnel \r\nrecords, but finds no indication that he was exposed to \r\ncombat and no information to confirm his claimed stressors.  \r\nThe Veteran's DD 214 shows that he served in the United \r\nStates Army from March 1967 to February 1970.  He received \r\nthe Vietnam Service Medal, the Vietnam Campaign Medal and the \r\nNational Defense Service Medal, but did not receive any \r\ndecorations or medals which are awarded exclusively for \r\ninvolvement in combat.  \r\n\r\nHis service personnel records also show that he was in \r\nVietnam from July 1967 to July 1968 and from February 1969 to \r\nFebruary 1970.  His listed military occupations were supply \r\nclerk, stock control and accounting specialist and equipment \r\nstore supervisor.  During the first Vietnam tour, he was \r\nassigned to the 625th Supply and Service Company (DS).  \r\nThroughout the second tour, he was assigned to Company E, \r\nU.S. Army Depot, Long Binh.  A section of the personnel \r\nrecords titled \"Campaigns\" lists the Vietnamese Counter \r\nOffensive PH III, Vietnam Counter Offensives Phase IV & V, \r\nTet Counter Offensive and \"Unnamed Campaign.\"  Such \r\nnotations regarding campaigns do not establish involvement in \r\ncombat.  As a general matter, evidence of participation in an \r\n\"operation\" or \"campaign\" often would not, in itself, \r\nestablish that a Veteran engaged in combat, because those \r\nterms ordinarily may encompass both combat and non-combat \r\nactivities.  VAOPGCPREC 12-99 (October 18, 1999).  \r\n\r\nIn this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran's claimed \r\nstressors are somewhat related to combat, but the Veteran was \r\na supply clerk in service and there is no indication he \r\nengaged in combat with the enemy.  The record must contain \r\nservice records or other corroborative evidence that \r\nsubstantiates or verifies the Veteran's testimony or \r\nstatements as to the occurrence of the claimed stressors.  A \r\nmedical opinion diagnosing PTSD does not suffice to verify \r\nthe occurrence of the claimed in-service stressors.  In this \r\nregard, the Veteran has described some events in his stressor \r\nstatements that he claims were very stressful to him and \r\ncaused his PTSD; those events include multiple instances of \r\nhis base coming under enemy rocket and mortar attacks and \r\nseeing a man who had his throat slashed and/or his head cut \r\noff because he fell asleep while on guard duty.  The \r\nVeteran's service treatment records and service personnel \r\nrecords do not contain indications of any instances of him \r\npersonally coming under fire or that the Veteran was directly \r\ninvolved in the claimed stressful incidents, however.\r\n\r\nPursuant to a request by the RO, the Center for Unit Records \r\nResearch (CURR) in June 2006 responded directly to the RO \r\nregarding the Veteran's claimed stressors.  CURR verified \r\nthat the Veteran was attached to the 625th Supply and Service \r\nCo, assigned to the 24th Supply and Service Battalion.  CURR \r\nnoted that the July to December 1967 morning reports \r\nsubmitted by the 625th Supply and Service Company do not list \r\nanyone assigned to the unit as killed in action.  \r\n\r\nHowever, documentation submitted in October 2008 by the \r\nVeteran's representative relates to the verification of the \r\nalleged mortar and rocket fire stressors experienced by the \r\nVeteran.  This documentation includes newspaper article \r\narchive abstracts from a number of different newspapers that \r\nshow An Khe received mortar attacks during January 1968, \r\nincluding in both early and late January.  One of the \r\navailable full articles, the Columbia Missourian, dated \r\nJanuary 26, 1968, reports on how An Khe was attacked with \r\nmortar fire and hostile troops and demolition squads \r\ninfiltrated the An Khe airfields and destroyed military \r\nequipment.  U.S. troops were noted as killed and wounded in \r\nthese attacks.  The Board notes that the Veteran's service \r\npersonnel records confirm that the Veteran was with the 625th \r\nSup & Svc Co. in Vietnam from July 1967 to July 1968, during \r\nwhich time the above attacks occurred.  USARV Circular Number \r\n210-2 shows that 625th Sup & Svc Co was located at An Khe \r\nduring this time.  \r\n\r\nThere is evidence both for and against the verification of \r\nthe Veteran's in-service stressors.  The Board notes that all \r\nthe precise details of the Veteran's claimed stressors have \r\nnot been verified.  However, this case is similar to \r\nPentecost, as the Veteran here had a non-combat MOS and \r\nclaimed that he was exposed to rocket and mortar fire during \r\nhis time in Vietnam, including during the Tet offensive of \r\n1968.  Records now associated with the claims file \r\ncorroborate the Veteran's assertion that enemy rocket and \r\nmortar fire attacks occurred during the time he was with \r\n625th Sup & Svc Co., although they do not document his \r\npersonal participation.  The Court in Pentecost determined \r\nthat the Veteran's presence with his unit at the time the \r\nattacks occurred corroborated his statement that he \r\nexperienced such attacks personally, and the Board finds a \r\nsimilar situation here, that the Veteran experienced such \r\nattacks personally. \r\n\r\nTherefore, taking into account the Veteran's contentions and \r\npersonnel records that show the Veteran served with the 625th \r\nSup & Svc Co. from July 1967 to July 1968 and the \r\ncontemporaneous newspaper articles that document the \r\nVeteran's base coming under fire, it is clear that the \r\ncorrobative evidence regarding some of the Veteran's in-\r\nservice stressors is at least in equipoise.  When there is \r\napproximate balance of positive and negative evidence \r\nregarding the merits of an issue material to the \r\ndetermination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in \r\nresolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102; \r\nGilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  Therefore, the \r\nBoard determines that, giving the Veteran the benefit of the \r\ndoubt, the Veteran's claimed stressors of undergoing rocket \r\nand mortar fire are corroborated by the evidence of record.\r\n\r\nThe next question presented is whether a stressor such as \r\nreported by the Veteran is clinically considered to be of \r\nsufficient severity to warrant a valid diagnosis of PTSD, \r\nconsistent with the diagnostic criteria in the American \r\nPsychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual \r\nof Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (1994) (DSM-IV).  See Cohen v. \r\nBrown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).\r\n\r\nJuly 1999 private medical records from Lafayette General \r\nHospital show the Veteran admitted to the medical psychiatric \r\nunit after presenting with suicidal ideation and a bullet for \r\na handgun.  The Veteran described isolating himself and \r\nindicated he did not like to be around crowds.  He was \r\nexperiencing poor sleep, depression, low self-confidence and \r\nlow self-worth.  He was diagnosed with major depression with \r\nsuicidal ideation and PTSD.  VA treatment records dated from \r\nSeptember 1997 to November 2002 show periodic mental health \r\nclinic treatment.  In November 2002, a psychiatry note \r\nincluded a diagnosis of PTSD.  Also of record is a report of \r\na VA psychiatric examination conducted in January 2003, which \r\nresulted in diagnoses including PTSD by history.  A March \r\n2006 treatment note contains a diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\nHere, the record includes an April 2007 VA examination, but \r\nthe Board deems this examination inadequate.  The examination \r\nfocused on discussing the Veteran's stroke and the examiner \r\nopined that he was not in the position to comment on the \r\nvalidity of the Veteran's previous diagnoses of PTSD.  He \r\nfurther opined that the Veteran did not currently meet the \r\ncriteria for PTSD.  The examiner noted that the Veteran had \r\napparently received a diagnosis of PTSD from a clinic in \r\nLafayette, but the records were not available to him.  The \r\nBoard observes that the examiner therefore did not examine \r\nthe July 1999 records currently in the claims file from \r\nLafayette General Hospital and did not otherwise comment on \r\nthe 1997 to 2002 VA treatment records showing PTSD, \r\ndepression and other mental health treatment, or the March \r\n2006 VA treatment record showing a diagnosis of PTSD.  In \r\naddition, the examiner did not comment on any of the \r\nVeteran's claimed stressors, as documented in the claims \r\nfile.  As a result, the Board is of the opinion that the \r\nVeteran should be afforded another VA examination to \r\ndetermine the etiology of any such claimed psychological \r\ndisorder found to be present, to include PTSD and its \r\nrelationship to the Veteran's verified stressors.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran is hereby notified that it is the Veteran's \r\nresponsibility to report for the examination and to cooperate \r\nin the development of the case, and that the consequences of \r\nfailure to report for a VA examination without good cause may \r\ninclude denial of the claim.  38 C.F.R. �� 3.158 and 3.655 \r\n(2008). \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO/AMC should obtain all VA \r\nmedical records regarding the Veteran's \r\ntreatment for the period from June 2006 to \r\nthe present, plus any additional private \r\nrecords identified by him. \r\n\r\n2.  Then, the RO should schedule the \r\nVeteran for an examination by a VA medical \r\nprofessional experienced in evaluating \r\npost-traumatic stress disorders, to \r\ndetermine the etiology of any psychiatric \r\ndisorder(s) found to be present.  All \r\nindicated tests and studies should be \r\naccomplished and all clinical findings \r\nreported in detail.\r\n\r\nThe examiner is advised that the Veteran \r\nserved in Vietnam and maintains that he was \r\nexposed to hostile mortar and rocket fire \r\nand seeing a man who had his throat slashed \r\nand/or head cut off because he fell asleep \r\nwhile on guard duty.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe examiner should elicit as much detail \r\nas possible from the Veteran as to such \r\nclaimed stressors, e.g., locations, dates, \r\nand identities of individuals involved. \r\nThen, the examiner should consider the \r\nVeteran's alleged in-service stressors for \r\nthe purpose of determining whether such \r\nstressors were severe enough to have caused \r\nthe current psychiatric symptoms, and \r\nwhether the diagnostic criteria to support \r\nthe diagnosis of PTSD have been satisfied \r\nby the in-service stressors.  The diagnosis \r\nshould conform to the psychiatric \r\nnomenclature and diagnostic criteria \r\ncontained in DSM-IV.\r\n\r\nIf the Veteran is found to have PTSD, the \r\nexaminer is requested to identify the \r\ndiagnostic criteria, including the specific \r\nstressor or stressors supporting the \r\ndiagnosis.  If PTSD is diagnosed, the \r\nexaminer is requested to render an opinion \r\nas to whether it is at least as likely as \r\nnot (i.e., a likelihood of 50 percent or \r\nmore) that any currently diagnosed PTSD is \r\na result of service or whether such an \r\netiology or relationship is unlikely (i.e., \r\nless than a 50-50 probability).  The \r\ndiagnosis should conform to the psychiatric \r\nnomenclature and diagnostic criteria \r\ncontained in the DSM-IV.\r\n\r\nIf the Veteran is found to have a \r\npsychiatric disorder other than PTSD, the \r\nexaminer is requested to provide an opinion \r\nas to whether it is at least as likely as \r\nnot (i.e., a likelihood of 50 percent or \r\nmore) that any currently diagnosed \r\npsychiatric disorder is causally related to \r\nmilitary service, or whether such a \r\ncausation or relationship is unlikely \r\n(i.e., less than a 50-50 probability).\r\n\r\nA complete rationale should be provided for \r\nany opinion offered.  The Veteran's claims \r\nfiles must be made available to the \r\nexaminer in conjunction with the \r\nexamination, and the examination report \r\nshould indicate the Veteran's medical \r\nrecords were reviewed, including the July \r\n1999 Lafayette Hospital record showing a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD, as well as 1997-2002 VA \r\ntreatment records showing mental health \r\ntreatment and PTSD and the March 2007 VA \r\ntreatment record showing PTSD.\r\n\r\n3.  Once the above action has been \r\ncompleted, readjudicate the claim and \r\nissue a supplemental statement of the \r\ncase.  Then afford the Veteran the \r\nrequisite opportunity to respond before \r\nthe claims folder is returned to the Board \r\nfor further appellate action.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter the Board has remanded.

A transcript of \r\nthis hearing was prepared and associated with the claims \r\nfile.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has claimed entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD based on incidents that occurred while he was stationed \r\nin Okinawa, Japan.  \r\n\r\nEstablishing service connection for PTSD currently requires: \r\n(1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD in accordance with 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 4.125 (for VA purposes, all mental disorder \r\ndiagnoses must conform to DSM-IV); (2) credible supporting \r\nevidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually \r\noccurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current \r\nsymptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2008); see Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. \r\n128 (1997).\r\n\r\nIf the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to \r\nthat combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence \r\nto the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is \r\nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone \r\nmay establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service \r\nstressor.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(1) (2008); see also, 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West 2002 & Supp. 2008).  Otherwise, the \r\nlaw requires verification of a claimed stressor.  Where a \r\ndetermination is made that the Veteran did not \"engage in \r\ncombat with the enemy,\" or the claimed stressor is unrelated \r\nto combat, the Veteran's lay testimony alone will not be \r\nenough to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.  \r\nSee Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395 (1996); Dizoglio v. \r\nBrown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 166 (1996).  In such cases, the \r\nrecord must include service records or other credible \r\nevidence that supports and does not contradict the Veteran's \r\ntestimony.  Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, 289 (1994).  \r\nMoreover, a medical opinion diagnosing PTSD does not suffice \r\nto verify the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressors.  \r\nSee Moreau, 9 Vet. App. at 395-396.\r\n\r\nIn an August 2003 stressor statement, the Veteran reported \r\nthat he was stationed as a Correctional Officer at the \r\nstockade at Camp Sukiron in March or April 1970.  He noted \r\nthat there was always the threat of violence and that he \r\nwitnessed inmates hurt each other with homemade weapons and \r\nsaw another Correctional Officer get hit in the head with a \r\nwater pitcher.\r\n\r\nIn September 1970, he was reassigned to the Traffic \r\nInvestigation Division.  He stated that he investigated many \r\nserious and fatal accidents during this time.  He described \r\nsearching for a soldier who ran off the road in his \r\nmotorcycle, and finding him with a limb through his neck.   \r\nHe described another motorcycle accident in which a soldier \r\nlost control and his gas tank exploded on impact.  The \r\nsoldier was badly burned and later died from shock.  In \r\nanother incident, a Marine refused to stop at a road block.  \r\nThe Veteran pursued him, and the Marine lost control, went \r\ninto a field, and hit a tree.  The Veteran reported being at \r\nhis side shortly after he hit the ground.  There was a hole \r\nin the Marine's forehead, and the Veteran held him in his \r\narms as he died.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran also described a time when he was stopped by a \r\ncivilian police officer and motioned to investigate a 1967 \r\nChevy army vehicle with a hose running from the tailpipe to \r\nthe back window with rags stuck around it.  The Veteran knew \r\nit was a suicide.  He broke the window, removed the man, and \r\ntried to revive him.  It was too late, and this man also died \r\nin the Veteran's arms.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran also reported having been on base in Okinawa \r\nduring the 1970 Koza riots.  At his March 2009 hearing, the \r\nVeteran testified that he was on call to go to the riots, but \r\nhe did not end up having to go.  He said that there were over \r\n60 police cars destroyed, overturned, and burned, and a lot \r\nof policemen got hurt.  He stated that he did not participate \r\nin the riots, but he saw the aftermath when people he knew \r\nreturned to base injured.\r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, the Board notes that the Veteran's DD \r\nForm 214 reflects that his military occupational specialty \r\n(MOS) was that of Military Police.  His service personnel \r\nrecord of assignments reflects that he was a military \r\npoliceman with the 62nd Military Police Company with the U.S. \r\nArmy Pacific Command in Okinawa from March 25, 1970, to \r\nSeptember 23, 1971.  His principle duty at that time was \r\nlisted as Military Policeman.\r\n\r\nThe Court has held that, in order to show presence during a \r\nstressful event, evidence need not demonstrate that a Veteran \r\nactually was present during the event if the evidence shows \r\nthat his unit was present during the event.  Pentecost v. \r\nPrincipi, 16 Vet. App. 124, 128 (Vet. App. May 24, 2002).\r\n\r\nThe U. S. Armed Services Center for Unit Records Research \r\n(CURR) (now the U. S. Army and Joint Services Record Research \r\nCenter (JSRRC)), was able to verify that the Veteran's unit, \r\nthe 62nd Military Police Company, was based on Okinawa on \r\nDecember, 20, 1970, the date that the Koza riots began.  The \r\nCURR report further noted that anecdotal information did \r\nindicate that at least 80 vehicles were burned, including 20 \r\nMP vehicles, that many people were injured, and that the \r\nrioters did break into Kadena Base and cause some damage \r\nbefore being pushed out by armed soldiers.  Consistent with \r\nPentecost, the Board concludes that the presence of the \r\nVeteran's unit on Okinawa in December 1970 corroborates the \r\nVeteran's own account of being present during the riots.  The \r\nBoard further notes that, while the Veteran may not have \r\ndirectly participated in the riots, his position with the \r\nmilitary police brought with it the elevated threat that the \r\nVeteran would be called upon to restore order and thus might \r\nbecome a target of violence.  The Board therefore finds that \r\nthis stressor has been verified.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the remaining stressors, the Board notes that \r\nthe Veteran's personnel records clearly verify that he served \r\nwith the Military Police.  The Board also observes that \r\nduties such as standing guard at a stockade, setting up road \r\nblocks, and investigating suicides and motorcycle and \r\nautomobile accidents are generally consistent with duties \r\nthat Military Police would be expected to perform.  \r\nTherefore, while VA has not verified any of the specific \r\nincidents described by the Veteran in connection with this \r\nclaim, and the Veteran has not provided specific information \r\nsuch as names or dates that would allow VA to attempt verify, \r\nit must be considered that the claimed stressors appear \r\nconsistent with the types of situations he would be expected \r\nto encounter in the course of performing his Military Police \r\nduties.  In essence, it is reasonable to assume that the \r\nVeteran's role in law enforcement would have put him in the \r\nposition of encountering people who had been injured or died, \r\nparticularly as a consequence of events such as automobile or \r\nmotorcycle accidents, as well as suicides.  The above \r\nstressors are therefore considered verified for the purposes \r\nof attempting to establish service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nHaving established the occurrence of several of the Veteran's \r\nclaimed in-service stressors, the Board now turns to the \r\nquestion of whether the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD \r\nand, if so, whether his PTSD is linked to any of his verified \r\nstressors.  With respect to establishing a PTSD diagnosis, \r\nthe Board notes that there are two VA examination reports of \r\nrecord.  The first examination, from October 2007, gives a \r\ndetailed account of the Veteran's medical, social, and \r\nemployment histories as well as a mental status evaluation.  \r\nNoting the varying diagnosis that the Veteran has been given \r\nthroughout his course of treatment, including findings of a \r\nsignificant personality disorder and possible malingering, \r\nthe examiner deferred diagnosis in the absence of \r\npsychological testing.  \r\n\r\nPsychological testing was conducted in January 2008.  The \r\nJanuary 2008 VA examination report describes the Veteran's \r\nhistory as told by the Veteran himself, noting several \r\ninconsistencies between his current narration and the \r\ninformation he provided at the October 2007 examination.  \r\nWhile the January 2008 report does state that the Veteran \r\nmeets criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD under the American \r\nPsychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of \r\nMental Disorders (4th ed. 1994) (DSM-IV), it also makes clear \r\nthat the psychological test results suggest malingering and \r\nfinds the test results are \"[p]robably [i]nvalid.\"  The \r\nexamination report does not provide a clear opinion on the \r\nrole that the Veteran's personality disorder or substance \r\nabuse may have played in the exaggeration or manifestation of \r\nPTSD symptoms.  For example, the examination report notes \r\nthat, \"[p]rior to beginning regular misuse of illicit \r\nsubstances, [the Veteran] performed his job without \r\nimpairment, despite having been exposed to the traumas \r\nreported above.\"  \r\n\r\nAs noted, even having accepted that the Veteran's claimed in-\r\nservice stressors did occur, the evidence must also show that \r\nhe has been diagnosed with PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 4.125, and that such diagnosis is specifically related to \r\nthe in-service stressors.  Given the findings reached during \r\nthe first VA examination, as well as the reservations \r\nexpressed in the report of the January 2008 VA examination as \r\nto the validity of the diagnosis, the Board finds that a new \r\nVA examination is required in order to clearly determine (1) \r\nwhether the Veteran has PTSD, and (2) if yes, whether the \r\nVeteran's PTSD may be attributable to verified, in-service \r\nstressors.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Arrange for a VA PTSD examination.  \r\nAll indicated studies, tests, and \r\nevaluations deemed necessary should be \r\nperformed.  The examiner should report a \r\nmulti-axial diagnosis, identifying all \r\ncurrent psychiatric disorders.  A \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD under DSM-IV criteria \r\nshould be made or definitively ruled out.  \r\nIf PTSD is diagnosed, the examiner should \r\nidentify the specific stressor(s) \r\nsupporting the diagnosis.  If PTSD is not \r\ndiagnosed, the examiner should explain why \r\nthe diagnosis was not made.  The rationale \r\nfor all opinions expressed should be \r\nexplained.  The claims file, including a \r\ncopy of this remand must be made available \r\nto the examiner for proper review of the \r\nmedical history.  The VA examiner must \r\nalso be provided a copy of this remand and \r\na description of all verified stressors.  \r\n\r\n2.  Then readjudicate the claim of \r\nentitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD.  If this claim is denied, the \r\nVeteran should be issued a supplemental \r\nstatement of the case, and given an \r\nopportunity to respond, before the case is \r\nreturned to the Board.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2008).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nMICHAEL LANE\r\nVeterans Law Judge, Board of Veterans' Appeals\r\n\r\nUnder 38 U.S.C.A. � 7252 (West 2002), only a decision of the \r\nBoard of Veterans' Appeals is appealable to the United States \r\nCourt of Appeals for Veterans Claims.

Donohue, Associate Counsel \r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army \r\nfrom February 1947 to January 1947 and from September 1950 to \r\nOctober 1951.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal of a June 2005 rating decision by the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nIndianapolis, Indiana, which denied service connection for \r\nPTSD. The Veteran requested de novo review by a Decision \r\nReview Officer (DRO).  \r\nThe DRO issued a statement of the case (SOC) in May 2006 that \r\ncontinued the denial of his claim.  The Veteran's appeal was \r\nperfected with the timely submission of his substantive \r\nappeal (VA Form 9) in June 2006.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified at a Travel Board hearing which was \r\nchaired by the undersigned Veterans Law Judge at the \r\nIndianapolis RO in April 2009.  A transcript of the hearing \r\nhas been associated with the Veteran's VA claims folder.\r\n\r\nAt the Travel Board hearing, the Veteran's representative \r\nmade a motion to advance this case on the Board's docket, \r\nwhich was granted.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 7107 (West 2002); 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 20.900 (2008).\r\n\r\nClarification of issue on appeal\r\n\r\nThe Veteran originally filed a claim of entitlement to \r\nservice connection for PTSD.  As is discussed in more detail \r\nbelow, the medical evidence of record indicates that the \r\nVeteran has been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and \r\ndepression; he has not been diagnosed with PTSD.  Although \r\nnot claimed by the Veteran, the Board is expanding his \r\noriginal claim to include all anxiety disorders.  See Clemons \r\nv. Shinseki, No. 07-0558 (U.S. Vet. App., Feb. 19, 2009) [a \r\nclaimant without medical expertise cannot be expected to \r\nprecisely delineate the diagnosis of his mental illness; he \r\nfiled a claim for the affliction his mental condition, \r\nwhatever it is, causes him].  \r\n\r\nIn Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384 (1993), the United \r\nStates Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court) held \r\nthat before the Board may address a matter that has not been \r\naddressed by the RO, it must consider whether the claimant \r\nhas been given adequate notice of the need to submit evidence \r\nor argument, an opportunity to submit such evidence or \r\nargument, and an opportunity to address the question at a \r\nhearing, and whether the claimant has been prejudiced by any \r\ndenials of those opportunities.  Although the RO, which was \r\nobviously without the benefit of Clemons, denominated the \r\nclaim as one for PTSD, the Board finds that the Veteran was \r\nnot prejudiced thereby.  As will be discussed below, the RO \r\nobtained all available medical records, which included \r\ndiagnoses of other anxiety disorders rather than PTSD.  The \r\nRO, in a letter dated March 22, 2005, asked for evidence of \r\n\"a relationship between your current disability and an \r\ninjury, disease, or event in military service.\"  The Veteran \r\npresented testimony as to the relationship between his \r\nmilitary service and his current mental disability at the \r\nTravel Board hearing in April 2009. \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  A preponderance of the competent medical evidence of \r\nrecord does not indicate that the Veteran has PTSD. \r\n\r\n2.  The evidence of record does not support a finding that a \r\nrelationship exists between the Veteran's currently diagnosed \r\nanxiety disorder and his military service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nAn anxiety disorder was not incurred in or aggravated by \r\nmilitary service. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131, 1110 (West 2002); 38 \r\nC.F.R. �� 3.303 (2008).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for an \r\nanxiety disorder, claimed as PTSD. \r\n\r\nIn the interest of clarity, the Board will first discuss \r\ncertain preliminary matters.  The Board will then render a \r\ndecision. \r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nThe Board has given consideration to the VCAA.  The VCAA \r\nincludes an enhanced duty on the part of VA to notify a \r\nclaimant as to the information and evidence necessary to \r\nsubstantiate claims for VA benefits.  The VCAA also redefines \r\nthe obligations of VA with respect to its statutory duty to \r\nassist claimants in the development of their claims.  See \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 5103, 5103A (West 2002).  \r\n\r\nThe VCAA alters the legal landscape in three distinct ways: \r\nstandard of review, notice and duty to assist.  The Board \r\nwill now address these concepts within the context of the \r\ncircumstances presented in this case.\r\n\r\nStandard of review\r\n\r\nAfter the evidence has been assembled, it is the Board's \r\nresponsibility to evaluate the entire record.  See 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 7104(a) (West 2002).  When there is an approximate \r\nbalance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material \r\nto the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt \r\nin resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102 \r\n(2008).  \r\n\r\nIn Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990), the Court \r\nstated that \"a veteran need only demonstrate that there is \r\nan 'approximate balance of positive and negative evidence' in \r\norder to prevail.\"  To deny a claim on its merits, the \r\npreponderance of the evidence must be against the claim.  See \r\nAlemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996), citing \r\nGilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 54.\r\n\r\nNotice\r\n\r\nThe VCAA requires VA to notify the claimant and the \r\nclaimant's representative, if any, of any information and any \r\nmedical or lay evidence not previously provided to VA that is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim.  As part of the notice, \r\nVA is to specifically inform the claimant and the claimant's \r\nrepresentative, if any, of which portion, if any, of the \r\nevidence is to be provided by the claimant and which part, if \r\nany, VA will attempt to obtain on behalf of the claimant. \r\n See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103 (West 2002); see also Quartuccio v. \r\nPrincipi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002) [a letter from VA to an \r\nappellant describing evidence potentially helpful to the \r\nappellant but not mentioning who is responsible for obtaining \r\nsuch evidence did not meet the standard erected by the VCAA].\r\n\r\nAfter having carefully reviewed the record, the Board has \r\nconcluded that the notice requirements of the VCAA have been \r\nsatisfied with respect to the issue on appeal.  The Board \r\nobserves that the Veteran was informed of the evidentiary \r\nrequirements for service connection in a letter from the RO \r\ndated March 22, 2005, including a request for evidence of \"a \r\nrelationship between your current disability and an injury, \r\ndisease, or event in military service.\"     \r\n\r\nCrucially, the RO informed the Veteran of VA's duty to assist \r\nhim in the development of his claim in the above-referenced \r\nMarch 2005 letter, whereby the Veteran was advised of the \r\nprovisions relating to the VCAA.  Specifically, the Veteran \r\nwas advised that VA would assist him with obtaining \r\n\"relevant records from any Federal agency.  This may include \r\nmedical records from the military, from VA Medical Centers \r\n(including private facilities where VA authorized treatment), \r\nor from the Social Security Administration.\"  With respect \r\nto private treatment records, the letter informed the Veteran \r\nthat the VA would make reasonable efforts to obtain private \r\nor non-Federal medical records to include \"records from \r\nState or local governments, private doctors and hospitals, or \r\ncurrent or former employers.\"  Furthermore, the VA included \r\ncopies of VA Form 21-4142, Authorization and Consent to \r\nRelease Information, which the Veteran could complete to \r\nrelease private medical records to the VA.  \r\n\r\nThe March 2005 letter further emphasized:  \"If [there is] \r\nevidence [that] is not in your possession, you must give us \r\nenough information about the evidence so that we can request \r\nit from the person or agency that has it.  If the holder of \r\nthe evidence declines to give it to us, asks for a fee to \r\nprovide it, or VA otherwise cannot get the evidence, we will \r\nnotify you.  It is your responsibility to make sure we \r\nreceive all requested records that are not in the possession \r\nof a Federal department or agency.\" [Emphasis as in the \r\noriginal letter]\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the March 2005 letter specifically \r\nrequested of the Veteran: \"If there is any other evidence or \r\ninformation that you think will support your claim, please \r\nlet us know.  If you have any evidence in your possession \r\nthat pertains to your claim, please send it to us.\"  This \r\ninformed the Veteran that he could submit or identify \r\nevidence other than what was specifically requested by the \r\nRO.  This complies with the \"give us everything you've got\" \r\nprovision formerly contained in 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) in that \r\nit informed the Veteran that he could submit or identify \r\nevidence other than what was specifically requested by the \r\nRO.  [The Board observes that 38 C.F.R. � 3.159 was recently \r\nrevised, effective as of May 30, 2008.  See 73 Fed. Reg. \r\n23,353-23,356 (April 30, 2008).  The final rule removes the \r\nthird sentence of 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1), which had stated \r\nthat VA will request the claimant to provide any evidence in \r\nthe claimant's possession that pertains to the claim.]  \r\n\r\nIn Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006), the Court \r\nobserved that a claim of entitlement to service connection \r\nconsists of five elements:  (1) veteran status; (2) existence \r\nof a disability; (3) a connection between the veteran's \r\nservice and the disability; (4) degree of disability; and (5) \r\neffective date.  Because a service connection claim is \r\ncomprised of five elements, the Court further held that the \r\nnotice requirements of section 5103(a) apply generally to all \r\nfive elements of that claim.  Therefore, upon receipt of an \r\napplication for a service connection claim, section 5103(a) \r\nand section 3.159(b) require VA to review the information and \r\nthe evidence presented with the claim and to provide the \r\nclaimant with notice of what information and evidence not \r\npreviously provided, if any, will assist in substantiating or \r\nis necessary to substantiate the elements of the claim as \r\nreasonably contemplated by the application.  This includes \r\nnotice that a disability rating and an effective date for the \r\naward of benefits will be assigned if service connection is \r\nawarded.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was provided specific notice of the Dingess \r\ndecision in a March 20, 2006 letter which detailed the \r\nevidence considered in determining a disability rating, \r\nincluding \"nature and symptoms of the condition; severity \r\nand duration of the symptoms; and impact of the condition and \r\nsymptoms on employment.\"  The Veteran was also advised in \r\nthe letter as to examples of evidence that would be pertinent \r\nto a disability rating, such as on-going treatment records, \r\nrecent Social Security determinations and statements from \r\nemployers as to job performance and time lost due to service-\r\nconnected disabilities.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to effective date, the March 2006 letter \r\ninstructed the Veteran that two factors were relevant in \r\ndetermining effective dates of increased rating claims: when \r\nthe claim was received; and when the evidence \"shows a level \r\nof disability that supports a certain rating under the rating \r\nschedule or other applicable standards.\"  The Veteran was \r\nalso advised in the letter as to examples of evidence that \r\nwould be pertinent to an effective date determination, such \r\nas information about continuous treatment or when treatment \r\nbegan, service medical records the Veteran may not have \r\nsubmitted and reports of treatment while attending training \r\nin the Guard or Reserve. \r\n\r\nIn short, the record indicates that the Veteran received \r\nappropriate notice pursuant to the VCAA.\r\n\r\nDuty to assist\r\n\r\nIn general, the VCAA provides that VA shall make reasonable \r\nefforts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary \r\nto substantiate a claim for VA benefits, unless no reasonable \r\npossibility exists that such assistance would aid in \r\nsubstantiating the claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A (West \r\n2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159 (2008).\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that reasonable efforts have been made to \r\nassist the Veteran in obtaining evidence necessary to \r\nsubstantiate his claim, and that there is no reasonable \r\npossibility that further assistance would aid in \r\nsubstantiating it.  In particular, the VA has obtained the \r\nVeteran's service treatment records and VA outpatient \r\ntreatment records.  \r\n \r\nThe Veteran's service personnel records have not been \r\nassociated with his VA claims folder, and the National \r\nPersonnel Records Center (NPRC) indicated that these records \r\nwere destroyed in a fire at the facility in 1973.  The Board \r\nis cognizant of Hayre v. West, 188 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. \r\n1999), wherein the United States Court of Appeals for the \r\nFederal Circuit elaborated on the VA's responsibility to \r\nobtain a veteran's service records.  The Board finds, \r\nhowever, that in light of evidence that the records were \r\ndestroyed in a fire there is no reasonable possibility that \r\nthe missing records may be located or recovered, and thus no \r\nuseful purpose would be served in remanding this matter for \r\nmore development.   \r\n\r\nIn this connection, the Board observes that where records are \r\nunavailable \"VA has no duty to seek to obtain that which \r\ndoes not exist.\"  See Counts v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 473, 477 \r\n(1994); Porter v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 233, 237 (1993).  See \r\nalso Hayre, supra [VA's efforts to obtain service department \r\nrecords shall continue until the records are obtained or \r\nunless it is reasonably certain that such records do not \r\nexist or that further efforts to obtain those records would \r\nbe futile].  So it is in this case.\r\n\r\nThe Board also observes that the Veteran has not been \r\naccorded a VA compensation and pension examination with \r\nregard to his claim, and that a medical opinion regarding the \r\netiology of the claimed disability has not been obtained.  \r\nThe law provides that the assistance provided by VA shall \r\ninclude providing a medical examination or obtaining a \r\nmedical opinion when such an examination or opinion is \r\nnecessary to make a decision on the claim.  An examination is \r\ndeemed \"necessary\" if the record does not contain \r\nsufficient medical evidence for VA to make a decision on the \r\nclaim.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.139 (2008).  For reasons explained \r\nimmediately below, such an examination and medical opinion \r\nare not necessary.\r\n\r\nUnder McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006), in \r\ninitial service connection claims, the VA must provide a VA \r\nmedical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a \r\ncurrent disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a \r\ndisability; (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, \r\nor disease occurred in service; (3) an indication that the \r\ndisability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a \r\ndisability may be associated with the veteran's service; and \r\n(4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for VA to \r\nmake a decision on the claim.\r\n\r\nAs will be discussed below, there is already medical evidence \r\nthat the Veteran currently has an anxiety disorder and \r\ndepression.  The record is missing critical evidence of that \r\nan event, injury, or disease occurred in service, McLendon \r\nelement (2), and the Veteran's claim is being denied on that \r\nbasis.  The outcome of this case thus hinges on matters other \r\nthan those which are amenable to VA examination and medical \r\nopinion. Specifically, resolutions of the claim of \r\nentitlement to service connection hinge directly or \r\nindirectly upon whether the Veteran was the victim suffered \r\nan in-service injury or disease.  That question cannot be \r\nanswered via medical examination or opinion, but rather on \r\nevidence already in the file, in particular the Veteran's \r\nservice medical records.\r\n\r\nAs explained in greater detail below, the outcome of the \r\nclaim of service connection hinges on what occurred, or more \r\nprecisely what did not occur, during service.  \r\nIn the absence of evidence of in-service disease, referral of \r\nthis case for an opinion as to etiology would in essence \r\nplace the examining physician in the role of a fact finder. \r\n This is the Board's responsibility.  In other words, any \r\nmedical opinion which provided a nexus between the Veteran's \r\nclaimed disability and his military service would necessarily \r\nbe based solely on his uncorroborated assertions regarding \r\nwhat occurred in service.  The Court has held on a number of \r\noccasions that a medical opinion premised upon an \r\nunsubstantiated account of a claimant is of no probative \r\nvalue.  See, e.g., Swann v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 229, 233 \r\n(1993) [generally observing that a medical opinion premised \r\nupon an unsubstantiated account is of no probative value, and \r\ndoes not serve to verify the occurrences described]; Reonal \r\nv. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) [the Board is not bound \r\nto accept a physician's opinion when it is based exclusively \r\non the recitations of a claimant]. \r\n\r\nThe facts of this case are different than the facts in \r\nCharles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002), in which the \r\nCourt held that VA erred in failing to obtain a medical nexus \r\nopinion where evidence showed acoustic trauma in service and \r\na current diagnosis of tinnitus. Significantly, in this case \r\nthere is no objective evidence of in-service disease or \r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances presented in this case, a remand \r\nordering a medical examination would serve no useful purpose. \r\nAccordingly, the Board has determined that a medical opinion \r\nis not necessary in the instant case.\r\n\r\nThe Board additionally observes that all appropriate due \r\nprocess concerns have been satisfied.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.103 \r\n(2008).  The Veteran has been accorded the opportunity to \r\npresent evidence and argument in support of his claim.  \r\nHe exercised the option of a personal hearing and was \r\nafforded one in April 2009 as detailed in the Introduction. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Board will proceed to a decision.  \r\n\r\nRelevant law and regulations \r\n\r\nService connection - in general\r\n\r\nIn general, service connection may be granted for disability \r\nor injury incurred in or aggravated by active military \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131 (West 2002); \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (2008).  \r\n\r\nIn order to establish service connection for the claimed \r\ndisorder, there must be (1) medical evidence of a current \r\ndisability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay \r\nevidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease \r\nor injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the \r\nclaimed in-service disease or injury and the current \r\ndisability.  See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 \r\n(1999).  The determination as to whether these requirements \r\nare met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record \r\nand the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  \r\nSee Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1, 8 (1999).\r\n\r\nService connection presupposes a current diagnosis of the \r\nclaimed disability.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. \r\n223, 225 (1992).  The Court has held that the \"current \r\ndisability\" requirement is satisfied \"when a claimant has a \r\ndisability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation \r\nis filed or during the pendency of that claim . . . even \r\nthough the disability resolves prior to the Secretary's \r\nadjudication of the claim.\"  See McClain v. Nicholson, \r\n21 Vet. App. 319 (2007).\r\n\r\nSpecific criteria to establish service connection for PTSD\r\n\r\nAccording to VA regulations, entitlement to service  \r\nconnection for PTSD requires that three elements be present:  \r\n(1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; (2) combat status or \r\ncredible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service \r\nstressors actually occurred; and (3) a link, established by  \r\nmedical evidence, between current symptomatology and the \r\nclaimed in service stressors.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) \r\n(2008); see also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nPTSD\r\n\r\nAs noted above, service connection for PTSD requires that \r\nthree elements be met: (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; \r\n(2) combat status or credible supporting evidence that the \r\nclaimed in-service stressors actually occurred; and (3) a \r\nlink, established by medical evidence, between current \r\nsymptomatology and the claimed in-service stressors.  See 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2008).\r\n\r\nWith respect to the first element, a current medical \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD, the evidence of record contains several \r\ndiagnostic reports and numerous VA out-patient records that \r\nfocus on the Veteran's mental illness. The Veteran has been \r\ndiagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression.  \r\nThe medical evidence of record does not include a diagnosis \r\nof PTSD.  Moreover, multiple VA outpatient treatment records \r\nspecifically rule out PTSD as a diagnosis.  See, e.g., \r\na February 2009 VA individual psychotherapy treatment note.\r\n \r\nA February 2004 Vet Center treatment record documented \"PTSD \r\ntype\" symptoms.  This record not provide a diagnosis.  See \r\nSanchez-Benitez v. West, 13 Vet. App. 282 (1999) [symptoms \r\nalone, without a diagnosed or identifiable underlying malady \r\nor condition, do not in and of themselves constitute a \r\ndisability for which service connection may be granted].  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has been accorded ample opportunity to present \r\nmedical evidence in support of his claim; he has failed to do \r\nso.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a) [it is the claimant's \r\nresponsibility to support a claim for VA benefits].  \r\n\r\nTo the extent that the Veteran himself believes that he has \r\nPTSD, it is now well established that lay persons without \r\nmedical training, such as the Veteran, are not competent to \r\ncomment on medical matters such as diagnosis, date of onset \r\nor cause of a disability.  See Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. \r\nApp. 491, 494-5 (1992) see also 38 C.F.R. � 3.159 (a)(1) \r\n[competent medical evidence means evidence provided by a \r\nperson who is qualified through education, training, or \r\nexperience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or \r\nopinions].  The statements offered in support of the \r\nVeteran's claim by him are not competent medical evidence and \r\ndo not serve to establish the existence of a current \r\ndisability.  \r\n\r\nIn the absence of a diagnosis, service connection for PTSD \r\nmay not be granted.  \r\nSee Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1997); \r\nGilpin v. Brown, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998) [service \r\nconnection cannot be granted if the claimed disability does \r\nnot exist].  Accordingly, 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) element (1) \r\nhas not been met and the Veteran's PTSD claim fails on this \r\nbasis alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnxiety disorder other than PTSD \r\n\r\nAs noted above, in order for service connection to be \r\ngranted, three elements must be present: (1) a current \r\ndisability; (2) in-service incurrence of disease or injury; \r\nand (3) medical nexus.  See Hickson, supra.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Hickson element (1), current disability, the \r\nmedical evidence indicates that the Veteran has been \r\ndiagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder and depression.  \r\nHickson element (1) has therefore been demonstrated. \r\n\r\nWith respect to Hickson element (2), the Veteran's service \r\ntreatment records are negative as to any suggestion of an \r\nanxiety disorder or any other psychiatric problem during \r\nservice.  The Veteran's January 1947 separation examination \r\nrevealed that no psychiatric disabilities were present; and \r\nthe service treatment records for the Veteran's second period \r\nof service, which ended in October 1951, do not describe any \r\npsychiatric complaints or disabilities.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, the first evidence of an anxiety disorder comes more \r\nthan 50 years after the Veteran left military service, in \r\nJanuary 2004, when the Veteran appeared for a VA outpatient \r\ngroup counseling on his own initiative.  There are no in-\r\nservice or post service medical records indicating that the \r\nVeteran developed an anxiety disorder during service.  \r\nAccordingly, Hickson element (2) has not been met, and the \r\nVeteran's claim fails on this basis alone. \r\n\r\nIn the absence of element (2), it follows that element (3), \r\nmedical nexus, is necessarily lacking.  Indeed, the evidence \r\nof record does not include any medical statements attempting \r\nto link the Veteran's currently diagnosed generalized anxiety \r\ndisorder or depression to his military service over a half \r\ncentury earlier.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has contended that stressful events in military \r\nservice led to his currently diagnosed anxiety disorder.  He \r\nhas presented no medical evidence in support of that \r\ncontention.  To the extent that the Veteran contends that a \r\nmedical relationship exists between his currently diagnosed \r\nanxiety disorder and depression and his military service, any \r\nsuch statements offered in support of the Veteran's claim do \r\nnot constitute competent medical evidence and cannot be \r\naccepted by the Board.  See Espiritu, supra.\r\n\r\nThe Board is of course aware of the provisions of 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.303(b), discussed above, relating to chronicity and \r\ncontinuity of symptomatology.  However, as noted above, the \r\nmedical evidence indicates that the Veteran's was noted to \r\nhave depression symptoms in January 2004.  He was first \r\ndiagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder in \r\nFebruary 2009, more than 50 years after he left military \r\nservice.  See Maxon v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. \r\n2000) [noting that it was proper to consider the Veteran's \r\nentire medical history, including the lengthy period of \r\nabsence of complaint with respect to the condition he now \r\nraised]; see also Voerth v. West, 13 Vet. App. 117, 120-21 \r\n(1999) [there must be medical evidence on file demonstrating \r\na relationship between the Veteran's current disability and \r\nthe claimed continuous symptomatology, unless such a \r\nrelationship is one as to which a lay person's observation is \r\ncompetent].  Such evidence is lacking in this case.  \r\nContinuity of symptomatology after service has therefore not \r\nbeen demonstrated.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, Hickson element (3), medical nexus, has not been \r\nsatisfied, and the claim fails on that basis as well.  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for an anxiety disorder is \r\ndenied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nBarry F.

Lucas, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from May 1967 to February \r\n1971.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a June 2003 rating decision by the Los \r\nAngeles, California, Regional Office (RO) of the Department \r\nof Veterans Affairs (VA), which denied entitlement to service \r\nconnection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nA hearing on this matter was held before the undersigned \r\nVeterans Law Judge sitting at the RO on February 7, 2006.  A \r\ncopy of the hearing transcript has been reviewed and has been \r\nassociated with the file.\r\n\r\nIn July 2006, this issue of entitlement to service connection \r\nfor PTSD was remanded to the RO for further development.  The \r\ncase was subsequently readjudicated in February 2009.  As the \r\noutcome remained unfavorable for the Veteran, this case has \r\nreturned to the Board for appellate review.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nA preponderance of the evidence is against a finding that the \r\nVeteran has PTSD related to his active service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by active military \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n�� 1101, 1110, 1154, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 \r\n(2008).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nDuties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nIn a correspondence dated in March 2003 and August 2006, the \r\nagency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) satisfied its duty to \r\nnotify the Veteran under 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5103(a) (West 2002) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) (2008).  \r\nSpecifically, in the March 2003 notice, the AOJ notified the \r\nVeteran of information and evidence necessary to substantiate \r\nhis claim for service connection for PTSD.  He was notified \r\nof the information and evidence that VA would seek to provide \r\nand the information and evidence that he was expected to \r\nprovide.  \r\n\r\nIn the August  2006 notice, the RO informed the Veteran of \r\nthe process by which disability ratings and effective dates \r\nare assigned.  See Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. \r\n473 (2006).  \r\n\r\nAlthough the August 2006 notice was delivered after the \r\nrating decision, the AOJ subsequently readjudicated the \r\nclaims based on all the evidence in the February 2009 \r\nsupplemental statement of the case (SSOC).  See Prickett v. \r\nNicholson, 20 Vet. App. 370, 376 (2006) (the issuance of a \r\nfully compliant notification letter followed by \r\nreadjudication of the claim, such as an SOC or SSOC, is \r\nsufficient to cure a timing defect).  Thus, the Veteran was \r\nnot precluded from participating effectively in the \r\nprocessing of his claims and the late notice did not affect \r\nthe essential fairness of the decision.  Sanders v. \r\nNicholson, 487 F.3d 881 (Fed. Cir. 2007).\r\n\r\nIn February 2006, the Board remanded the claim to the Appeals \r\nManagement Center (AMC) to obtain additional evidence.  The \r\nVeteran testified to incidents aboard the U.S.S. Hector and \r\nU.S.S. Ajax.  The AMC contacted the National Archives and \r\nRecords Administration (NARA) to obtain copies of the deck \r\nlogs for each vessel.  By correspondence dated in May 2007 \r\nand June 2008, the AMC was notified that there was no mention \r\nof the events reported by the Veteran in either deck logs.  \r\nThe Board is satisfied that reasonable efforts have been made \r\nto obtain the requested records.  Therefore, no further \r\nattempts are necessary to obtain evidence in this case.   \r\n\r\nVA has done everything reasonably possible to assist the \r\nVeteran with respect to his claim for benefits in accordance \r\nwith 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A (West 2002) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c) \r\n(2008).  Service treatment records have been associated with \r\nthe claims file.  All identified and available treatment \r\nrecords have been secured.  The Veteran has been medically \r\nevaluated in conjunction with his claim.\r\n\r\nService Connection for PTSD\r\n\r\nThe Veteran seeks service connection for PTSD.  Service \r\nconnection may be granted for disability resulting from \r\ndisease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active \r\nmilitary duty.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 2002).  Service \r\nconnection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed \r\nafter discharge when all the evidence, including that \r\npertinent to service, establishes that the disease was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d) (2008).  \r\n\r\nVA regulations reflect that symptoms attributable to PTSD are \r\noften not manifested in service.  Accordingly, service \r\nconnection for PTSD requires:  (1) a current diagnosis of \r\nPTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed \r\nin-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical \r\nevidence of a causal nexus between the current symptomatology \r\nand the claimed in-service stressor.  See 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f) (2008); Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 138 \r\n(1997) (citing Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 394-95 \r\n(1996)).  \r\n\r\n38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) (2008) requires that diagnoses of mental \r\ndisorders conform to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of \r\nMental Disorders (4th ed.) (DSM-IV).  The DSM-IV sets forth \r\nspecific criteria which must be met to establish a diagnosis \r\nof service connection for PTSD.  These are:  \r\n\r\nA.  The person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which \r\nboth of the following were present:\r\n\r\n(1) the person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted \r\nwith an event or events that involved actual or \r\nthreatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the \r\nphysical integrity of self or others; and (2) the \r\nperson's response involved intense fear, helplessness, \r\nor horror. . . .\r\n\r\nB.  The traumatic event is persistently experienced in one \r\n(or more) of the following ways:\r\n\r\n(1) recurrent and intrusive distressing recollections of \r\nthe event, including images, thoughts, or perceptions; \r\n(2) recurrent distressing dreams of the event; (3) \r\nacting or feeling as if the traumatic event were \r\nrecurring (includes a sense of reliving the experience, \r\nillusions, hallucinations, and dissociate flashback \r\nepisodes, including those that occur on awakening or \r\nwhen intoxicated); (4) intense psychological distress at \r\nexposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or \r\nresemble an aspect of the traumatic event; or (5) \r\nphysiological reactivity on exposure to internal or \r\nexternal cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of \r\nthe traumatic event.\r\n\r\nC.  Persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the \r\ntrauma and numbing of general responsiveness (not present \r\nbefore the trauma), as indicated by three (or more) of the \r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n(1) efforts to avoid thoughts, feelings, or \r\nconversations associated with the trauma; (2) efforts to \r\navoid activities, places, or people that arouse \r\nrecollections of the trauma; (3) inability to recall an \r\nimportant aspect of the trauma; (4) markedly diminished \r\ninterest or participation in significant activities; (5) \r\nfeeling of detachment or estrangement from others; (6) \r\nrestricted range of affect (e.g., unable to have loving \r\nfeelings); or (7) sense of a foreshortened future (e.g., \r\ndoes not expect to have a career, marriage, children, or \r\na normal life span).\r\n\r\nD.  Persistent symptoms of increased arousal (not present \r\nbefore the trauma), as indicated by two (or more) of the \r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n(1) difficulty falling or staying asleep; (2) \r\nirritability or outbursts of anger; (3) difficulty \r\nconcentrating; (4) hypervigilance; or (5) exaggerated \r\nstartle response.\r\n\r\nE.  Duration of the disturbance (symptoms in Criteria B, C, \r\nand D) is more than 1 month.\r\n\r\nF.  The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or \r\nimpairment in social, occupational, or other important areas \r\nof functioning.\r\n\r\nThe credible supporting evidence required to confirm a \r\nstressor will vary depending on whether the Veteran was \r\n\"engaged in combat with the enemy.\"  See Hayes v. Brown, 5 \r\nVet. App. 60, 66 (1993).  If the evidence establishes that \r\nthe Veteran was engaged in combat with the enemy or was a \r\nprisoner of war (POW), and the claimed stressor is related to \r\ncombat or POW experiences (in the absence of clear and \r\nconvincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the \r\nclaimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, \r\nconditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service), the \r\nVeteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of \r\nthe claimed in-service stressor.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West \r\n2002).  The legislative history of this provision, as cited \r\nby the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, explains that \r\nthis is because \"the absence of an official record of care \r\nor treatment in many of such cases is readily explained by \r\nthe conditions surrounding the service of combat Veterans.\"  \r\nArms v. West, 12 Vet. App. 188 (1999).  \r\n\r\nWhere, however, the VA determines that the Veteran did not \r\nengage in combat with the enemy and was not a POW, or the \r\nclaimed stressor is not related to combat or POW experiences, \r\nthe Veteran's lay statements, by themselves, will not be \r\nenough to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.  \r\nInstead, the record must contain service records or other \r\ncredible evidence which corroborates the stressor.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d), (f) \r\n(2008); Gaines v. West, 11 Vet. App. 353, 357-58 (1998).  \r\nSuch corroborating evidence cannot consist solely of after-\r\nthe-fact medical nexus evidence.  See Moreau, 9 Vet. App. at \r\n396.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary meaning of the phrase \"engaged in combat with \r\nthe enemy,\" as used in 38 U.S.C. � 1154(b) (2008), requires \r\nthat a Veteran have participated in events constituting an \r\nactual fight or encounter with a military foe or hostile unit \r\nor instrumentality.  The issue of whether any particular set \r\nof circumstances constitutes engagement in combat with the \r\nenemy for purposes of section 1154(b) must be resolved on a \r\ncase-by-case basis.  See VAOPGCPREC 12-99 (October 18, 1999).  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran claims that he has PTSD related to stressors \r\nexperienced in service.  The Veteran did not receive any \r\ndecorations or medals related to combat service and there is \r\nno indication in his official service records, including his \r\nDD-214 that he participated in combat.  The Board finds that \r\nhe did not participate in combat.  At his personal hearing \r\nbefore the Board, the Veteran described two major stressors \r\nin service.  The Veteran contends that while loading \r\nammunition onto smaller ships he witnessed a near amputation.  \r\nHe relates another stressful event as observing someone \r\nfollowing a near electrocution.  At his February 2006 \r\nhearing, the Veteran testified that he did not personally \r\nwitness this event, but saw the aftermath.  (See hearing \r\ntranscript, page 8).  He contends that he still smells \r\nburning flesh as a result.  \r\n\r\nPost-service records reflect treatment for depression and \r\nPTSD.  In December 2001 the Veteran reported being under a \r\nlot of stress due to recent deaths of family members, \r\nincluding his mother.  The diagnosis was depression, and he \r\nwas referred for a mental health consultation.  In March 2002 \r\nat the VA outpatient clinic in Bakersfield, the Veteran \r\nreported feeling depressed since he was laid-off.  He stated \r\nthat he gets angry easily and could not sleep or concentrate.  \r\nHe also said he felt like he had no hope and as if he lost \r\neverything.  Again, he was not treated for or diagnosed with \r\nPTSD.  The diagnosis was major depressive disorder.  \r\n\r\nBy May 2002, the Veteran's VA outpatient records reflected a \r\ndiagnosis as PTSD.  The VA psychiatrist noted complaints of \r\nsocial withdrawal, panic attacks, nightmares and flashbacks.  \r\nThe Veteran arrived with complaints regarding the medication \r\nhe was previously prescribed for depression.  It appears his \r\nmedication was changed along with his diagnosis.  In August \r\n2002, the Veteran continued to relate his depressive symptoms \r\nto the deaths of his family members.  At no time, did the \r\nVeteran report any of his symptoms were due to an in-service \r\nincident.    \r\n\r\nIn November 2002, was the first instance in which the Veteran \r\nreported experiencing dreams, pain, anger and flashbacks as a \r\nresult of his Vietnam service.  The Veteran denied \r\nhallucinations, suicidal thoughts and delusions.  He reported \r\ncrying spells, social withdrawal and nightmares.  The VA \r\npsychiatrist's impression was PTSD.  By letter also in \r\nNovember 2002, it was reported that the Veteran experiences \r\nintrusive distressing recollections of the Vietnam War \r\nincluding images, thoughts and perceptions.  The psychiatrist \r\nstated the Veteran persistently dreams of frightening and \r\nthreatening experiences over the combat zone.  It was \r\nconcluded that the Veteran is unable to maintain gainful \r\nemployment and maintain attention and concentration as a \r\nresult of his PTSD.  \r\n \r\nThe Veteran underwent a VA examination for PTSD in December \r\n2008, but was not diagnosed with PTSD.  The claims folder was \r\nmade available during the examination.  The examiner \r\nquestioned the Veteran about his mental and physical \r\ncompetencies, and felt the Veteran's thought process and \r\ncommunication did not evidence clinical impairment.  The \r\nexaminer noted that the Veteran's primary focus was on his \r\nfinancial situation, and that he felt he needed help from VA.  \r\nAs far as evidence of PTSD, he denied suicidal or homicidal \r\nideation, intent or plan.  The Veteran's thought process was \r\nlinear and goal directed.  He reported waking up at night due \r\nto prostate problems, and not from nightmares of his service \r\nexperience.  He described his hypervigilance about people on \r\nthe street as related to social conditions in the news and \r\nnot trusting people.  The Veteran did not relate his \r\ncarefulness concerning people to his military experiences.  \r\nAs far as his marital problems, the Veteran described \r\npersonality issues unrelated to service.  The examiner noted \r\nthat following his discharge from service, the Veteran worked \r\nas a security guard and carried a gun for a few years.  The \r\nexaminer's assessment was major depression unrelated to \r\nservice.  \r\n\r\nAs stated, service connection for PTSD requires that \r\ndiagnoses of mental disorders conform to the DSM-IV.  This \r\nincludes evidence that a diagnosis be made based on a \r\ncredible claimed in-service stressor(s), unless the Veteran \r\nserved in combat.  Based on the formal findings issued by the \r\nNARA, there is no evidence in the deck logs that either an \r\nelectrocution or near amputation took place during the \r\nVeteran's service.  His service personnel records did not \r\nverify any incidents of attacks involving the Veteran or his \r\nunit.  The Veteran's MOS does not indicate, nor has he \r\nalleged, that his responsibilities included manning the \r\nweapons or launching missiles in combat.  There is no \r\nconvincing, credible evidence of record that an in-service \r\nstressor incident took place.  \r\n\r\nThe VA psychiatrist in November 2002 made a diagnosis of \r\nPTSD, but there was no reference to the stressors that \r\nprecipitated the diagnosis other than recollections of the \r\nVietnam War and experiences over the combat zone.  However, \r\nthe Veteran does not claim that his PTSD is combat-related.  \r\nReference was not made to specific criteria of DSM-IV and the \r\nmedical report is not as thorough as the latter VA \r\nexamination report.  There is no evidence of a mental status \r\ninterview conducted in 2002 where the diagnostic status for \r\nAxis I through V was provided by the psychiatrist.  The Board \r\nis not required to accept a physician or other health \r\nprofessional diagnosis of PTSD that is based on \r\nuncorroborated account of the Veteran's active service \r\nexperiences.  See Swann v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 229, 233 (1993) \r\nand Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 192 (1991).  The \r\nBoard finds the 2008 VA examiner's opinion more probative \r\nsince it was based on the Veteran's history, records and \r\nevaluation.  It cited to the Veteran's claimed stressors and \r\ndiscussed why the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran claim that service caused PTSD is not supported \r\nby the overall evidence.  The Board is bound by the governing \r\nstatutes and regulations, which require that in claims for \r\nservice connection for PTSD, the diagnosis must be in \r\naccordance with DSM-IV.  In this case, the evidence falls \r\nshort of such support.  As the preponderance of the evidence \r\nis against the Veteran's claim, the benefit of the doubt \r\nprovision does not apply.  Service connection for PTSD must \r\nbe denied.\r\n\r\nAs far as the Veteran's diagnosis for major depressive \r\ndisorder, the Veteran does not contend and the record does \r\nnot show that major depressive disorder had its onset or is \r\notherwise related to active duty.  In fact, the Veteran \r\nrelated his depressive symptoms to the death of several \r\nfamily members including his mother and cousin.  Post-service \r\ntreatment records show that he was first diagnosed with \r\ndepression in 2002, or more than 31 years post-service.  \r\nEvidence of a prolonged period without medical complaint, and \r\nthe amount of time that elapsed since military service, can \r\nbe considered as evidence against the claim.  Maxson v. \r\nGober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  \r\n\r\nIn sum, there can be no valid claim in the absence of proof \r\nof a present disability.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. \r\n223 (1992).  The record here does not contain evidence that \r\ndemonstrates that the Veteran has PTSD.  Accordingly, the \r\nBoard finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against \r\nthe issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  \r\nThis claim must, therefore, be denied.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5107(b) (West 2002); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 \r\n(1990).  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nTHOMAS J.

Mullins, Associate Counsel \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from August 1969 to March \r\n1972 and from June 1979 to December 1991.  He also served on \r\nactive duty from March 1972 to June 1979, except for an \r\nunspecified 20 months of inactive service during that period.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a June 2001 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO) in \r\nMontgomery, Alabama.  This claim was previously remanded by \r\nthe Board in March 2005 for additional development.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he is entitled to service \r\nconnection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  \r\nHowever, insufficient efforts have been made to verify the \r\nVeteran's alleged in-service stressors.  As such, this claim \r\nis not ready for appellate review.  \r\n\r\nEstablishment of service connection for PTSD requires: (1) \r\nmedical evidence diagnosing PTSD; (2) credible supporting \r\nevidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually \r\noccurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current \r\nsymptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.304(f).  See also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 \r\n(1997).  \r\n\r\nIn a letter dated August 2008, the JSRRC coordinator made a \r\nformal finding that there was a lack of information required \r\nto corroborate the Veteran's alleged stressors.  A May 2008 \r\nletter sent to the Veteran informed him that an approximate \r\ntime range of 2 months was needed to research the Veteran's \r\nstressors.  This letter noted that the Veteran's statement \r\nreceived in February 2008 did not provide VA with \r\nsufficiently detailed information.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the May 2008 letter made no mention of the Veteran's \r\nsubsequent statement regarding his alleged in-service \r\nstressor.  Specifically, VA received a statement from the \r\nVeteran in April 2008 providing VA with the location and \r\nnature of his alleged in-service stressors.  The Veteran also \r\nnarrowed down the time of the incident to June 1991.  The \r\nAugust 2008 JSRRC report makes no mention of the Veteran's \r\nApril 2008 statement.  Therefore, it does not appear that \r\nthis evidence was considered when denying the Veteran's \r\nclaim.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's claim must be remanded.  The Veteran's claim \r\nhas been denied for a failure to supply VA with sufficiently \r\ndetailed information regarding his alleged in-service \r\nstressors.  However, the record contains a much more detailed \r\nstatement from the Veteran that does not appear to have been \r\nconsidered.  An additional attempt to verify the Veteran's \r\nalleged in-service stressors must be made.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1. The AMC should contact the U.S. Army \r\nand Joint Services Records Research Center \r\n(JSRRC) (formerly the U.S. Armed Services \r\nCenter for Unit Records Research (CURR)) \r\nto verify the claimed stressor, i.e., \r\nwhether there was an incident involving \r\nexploding ammunition in June 1991 at Camp \r\nDoha, Kuwait that resulted in the death of \r\nthree soldiers, and if so, whether the \r\nVeteran was present at this time.  \r\nSpecific reference should be made to the \r\nVeteran's April 2008 statement regarding \r\nhis in-service stressors.  \r\n\r\nA copy of the Veteran's service personnel \r\nrecords showing his units and assignments \r\nshould be provided with the request to the \r\nJSRRC. \r\n\r\n2. After response is received from the \r\nJSRRC, if and only if any stressor is \r\nverified, the Veteran should be afforded \r\npsychiatric examination.  The claims file \r\nmust be made available to the physician \r\ndesignated to examine the Veteran, and the \r\nexamination report should include \r\ndiscussion of the Veteran's documented \r\nmedical history and assertions, and the \r\ninformation obtained during stressor \r\ndevelopment.  All indicated tests and \r\nstudies, including psychological testing, \r\nshould be accomplished, and all clinical \r\nfindings should be reported in detail.  \r\nThe examiner should be informed that only \r\nstressors or stressful conditions that \r\nhave been verified by the AMC may be used \r\nas a basis for a diagnosis of PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner should be asked to provide an \r\nopinion addressing the following \r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n(a) Is a diagnosis of PTSD appropriate?\r\n\r\n(b) If so, is it at least as likely as not \r\nthat the Veteran has PTSD as a result of \r\nthe stressor found to be established by \r\nthe record during his military service?\r\n\r\nA complete rationale for the opinion \r\nexpressed must be provided.  \r\n\r\n3. The expanded record should then be \r\nreviewed and it should be determined if \r\nthe Veteran's claim can be granted.  If \r\nthe claim is not granted, the Veteran and \r\nhis representative should be furnished an \r\nappropriate supplemental statement of the \r\ncase (SSOC), and be afforded an \r\nopportunity to respond.  Thereafter, the \r\ncase should be returned to the Board for \r\nappellate review.   \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2008).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nJ.

L. Wasser, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from May 1985 to November \r\n1986.\r\n\r\nThis case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on \r\nappeal from a November 2005 decision by the RO in Oakland, \r\nCalifornia that denied service connection for PTSD.  The \r\nVeteran initially requested a Board hearing, but by a \r\nstatement dated in December 2008, she withdrew her hearing \r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that she has PTSD as a result of a \r\nsexual assault during service.  Service connection for PTSD \r\ngenerally requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition \r\nin accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125; a link, established by \r\nmedical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service \r\nstressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed \r\nin-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2008).  \r\n\r\nBy a statement dated in May 2005, the Veteran claimed that \r\nshe was sexually assaulted by a civilian photographer during \r\nmilitary service in Panama.  She also reported that she was \r\nsexually abused during childhood and adolescence, and that \r\nshe received extensive counseling and mental health treatment \r\nprior to service.  She contends that she never reported the \r\nin-service sexual assault at the time, but repressed her \r\nmemories of the event for many years, and did not recall it \r\nuntil 2002, when her father died.  She stated that during \r\nservice, she began drinking heavily and using cocaine in July \r\nor August 1986, and admitted herself to Gorgas Army Hospital \r\nfor depression in late August 1986.  In her May 2005 \r\nstatement, she said she could not recall the date of the in-\r\nservice assault or the photographer's name, but thought he \r\nwas employed by the government, although he was a civilian \r\nand possibly Panamanian.  She said the photo shoot and \r\nassault took place in a motel, but she did not know where.  \r\nShe said that the photographer threatened to reveal his nude \r\nphotographs of her to her military superiors unless she \r\nconsented to sex.  She also stated that he overpowered and \r\nraped her.  She contended that the assault led to her abuse \r\nof alcohol and drugs.  She also stated that although service \r\ntreatment records show that she was pregnant in December \r\n1985, she did not recall being pregnant until she recently \r\nsaw her service treatment records.  She said she first sought \r\nmental health treatment in 2002, when she recalled the in-\r\nservice assault.\r\n\r\nIn a May 2006 statement, the Veteran said that in October \r\n1985, she was raped by \"[redacted],\" a civilian photographer who \r\nworked at the photography laboratory that was located in the \r\nsame building as her barracks in Panama, that she became \r\npregnant as a result, and that this assault led to her \r\ncurrent PTSD.  She submitted an April 2006 letter from \r\nCentral Coast Polygraph reflecting that a polygraph examiner \r\ndetermined she was being truthful when she related the events \r\nsurrounding her reported in-service assault.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service personnel records show that she was \r\nstationed in Panama from October 1985 to November 1986.  She \r\nwas discharged from service in November 1986 on the basis of \r\na personality disorder.  \r\n\r\nService treatment records reflect that on entrance medical \r\nexamination in April 1985, a psychiatric disorder was not \r\nnoted.  In an April 1985 report of medical history, the \r\nVeteran denied a history of depression or excessive worry, or \r\nnervous trouble of any sort.  She also denied treatment for a \r\nmental condition.  In August 1985, the Veteran reported that \r\nprior to service, she saw a family counselor for about a year \r\nand received anti-depressant medication.  She also reported \r\nthat she was raped about four years ago.  The diagnosis was \r\nadjustment disorder with depressed mood.  A September 1986 \r\nmedical statement reflects the following diagnoses:  alcohol \r\nabuse, episodic, cocaine abuse, episodic, adjustment disorder \r\nwith depressed mood, and borderline personality disorder.  It \r\nwas noted that the Veteran was dissatisfied with her job and \r\nduty location assignment.  Service treatment records reflect \r\nboth positive and negative pregnancy tests.  \r\n\r\nIn July 2002, the Veteran was treated at a Vet Center after \r\nshe was referred to see if she could file a claim for PTSD \r\nbased on an unreported date rape.  She also reported a \r\nhistory of being sexually abused as a child.  Vet Center \r\nrecords from 2005 to 2006 reflect treatment for PTSD due to \r\nmilitary sexual trauma (MST).\r\n\r\nA treating clinical psychologist from a VA Vet Center, \r\nL.W.M., Ph.D., has diagnosed PTSD due to in-service sexual \r\nassault, which she believes is supported by the record \r\nshowing that the Veteran's academic and occupational \r\nachievement significantly declined since her reported \r\nmilitary sexual trauma (MST).  In March 2005 Dr. M. opined \r\nthat traumatic events in the Veteran's childhood and \r\nadolescence contributed to her chronic psychological \r\ndifficulties and that the MST exacerbated her pre-existing \r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nIn August 2005, a VA psychologist noted the Veteran's history \r\nof hospitalization during service for substance abuse and \r\ndepression.  She reported that she was sexually abused as a \r\nchild and was sexually assaulted during military service.  \r\nShe reported current cannabis use.  The psychologist \r\ndiagnosed PTSD (MST), and cannabis abuse.  Later that month, \r\na VA psychiatrist diagnosed cannabis dependence, amphetamine \r\nabuse, and PTSD (MST).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran underwent a VA compensation and pension \r\nexamination in September 2005, in which she related her \r\nhistory and claimed in-service stressor to the examiner.  The \r\nexaminer diagnosed PTSD which existed prior to service and \r\nthat was aggravated by MST during her active duty.  The Board \r\nnotes that the examiner gave no rationale for the opinion.  \r\n\r\nIn this regard, the Board notes that a veteran will be \r\npresumed to have been in sound condition when examined, \r\naccepted, and enrolled in service, except as to defects, \r\ninfirmities, or disorders noted at entrance into service.  \r\nOnly such conditions as are recorded in examination reports \r\nare to be considered as noted.  When no preexisting condition \r\nis noted upon entry into service, the veteran is presumed to \r\nhave been sound upon entry and then the burden falls on the \r\ngovernment to rebut the presumption of soundness.  Wagner v. \r\nPrincipi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Rebutting the \r\npresumption of soundness requires that VA show by clear and \r\nunmistakable evidence that (1) the veteran's disability \r\nexisted prior to service and (2) that the preexisting \r\ndisability was not aggravated during service.  \r\n\r\nA pre-existing injury or disease will be considered to have \r\nbeen aggravated by active service where there is an increase \r\nin disability during such service, unless clear and \r\nunmistakable evidence shows that the increase in disability \r\nis due to the natural progress of the disease.  See 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1153 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.306.\r\n\r\nAfter a review of the file, the Board finds that another VA \r\nexamination is warranted to ascertain the nature of any \r\npsychiatric disorder that may have existed prior to service, \r\nand if shown, whether the Veteran's preexisting psychiatric \r\ndisability was aggravated by service.  The examiner should \r\nalso opine as to whether the claimed in-service stressor is \r\nsufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD, and determine the \r\netiology of any current psychiatric disorder.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5103A; 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(4).\r\n\r\nMoreover, during the September 2005 VA examination, the \r\nVeteran reported that she was treated for two years prior to \r\nservice for childhood sexual trauma, by her mother's \r\ncounselor.  She also reported mental health treatment by \r\nJ.G., MSW from 1989 to 1990.  These private medical records \r\nare not on file and should be obtained prior to Board review.  \r\nPertinent ongoing medical records should also be obtained.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(c); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c); see also Bell \r\nv. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992).\r\n\r\nIn cases in which personal assault is alleged, VA's duties to \r\nassist a claimant in substantiating a claim include informing \r\nthe claimant that evidence from sources other than service \r\nrecords may constitute credible supporting evidence.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103a, 5106, 5107, 5126; 38 \r\nC.F.R. �� 3.159, 3.304(f)(3); Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. \r\n272 (1999).  On remand, the Veteran should be provided with \r\nadequate notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Furnish the Veteran and her \r\nrepresentative a letter advising her that \r\nan in-service personal assault may be \r\ncorroborated by evidence from sources \r\nother than the service records, as \r\ndefined in 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3).  If a \r\nresponse is received from the Veteran or \r\nher representative, review the record in \r\nconjunction with that response, and \r\ndetermine if further development is \r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n2.  Contact the Veteran and ask her to \r\nidentify any VA or private facilities \r\nwhere she was treated for a psychiatric \r\ndisorder throughout her life.  Obtain any \r\nof the Veteran's psychiatric treatment \r\nrecords not currently associated with the \r\nclaims file and associate them therewith.  \r\nIn particular, the RO/AMC should attempt \r\nto obtain pre-service private mental \r\nhealth treatment records from her \r\nmother's counselor, and private medical \r\nrecords dated from 1989 to 1990 by J.G., \r\nMSW.  If any records are unavailable, a \r\nnotation to that effect should be made in \r\nthe claims file.\r\n\r\n3.  Schedule the Veteran for a VA \r\npsychiatric examination to determine \r\nwhether she has a psychiatric disorder, \r\nto include PTSD, in accordance with DSM-\r\nIV criteria based on an in-service \r\nstressor event, and to obtain an opinion \r\nas to the current nature and likely \r\netiology of any diagnosed psychiatric \r\ndisorder, to include the claimed PTSD, \r\nand whether it is due to inservice \r\naggravation of any pre-service \r\npsychiatric disorder.  Ensure that an \r\nexamination notice letter is sent to the \r\nVeteran, and this should be documented in \r\nthe claims folder.  The claims folder \r\nshould be made available to the examiner \r\nprior to completion of the examination \r\nreport.  Any indicated studies should be \r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nThe claims file must be reviewed by the \r\nexaminer in conjunction with the \r\nexamination.  Based on review of the \r\nrecord and evaluation of the Veteran, the \r\npsychiatrist should provide opinions \r\nresponding to the following:\r\n\r\n(a) Does the Veteran have a current \r\npsychiatric disorder, and, if so,\r\n\r\n(i) does the evidence of record clearly \r\nand unmistakably show that the Veteran \r\nhad a psychiatric disorder that existed \r\nprior to her military service?\r\n\r\n(ii) If the answer is yes, does the \r\nevidence clearly and unmistakably show \r\nthat the preexisting condition was not \r\naggravated by service?\r\n\r\n(iii) if the answer is no, is it at least \r\nas likely as not that the psychiatric \r\ndisorder had its onset in service? \r\n\r\n(b) What is the correct diagnosis for the \r\nVeteran's current psychiatric disability?  \r\nSpecifically, do the symptoms noted \r\nsupport or exclude a diagnosis of PTSD?\r\n\r\n(c) If PTSD is diagnosed, are the \r\nVeteran's alleged stressor events in \r\nservice, as described in her accounts \r\nevents of sufficient gravity to support a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD?  Does the Veteran have \r\nPTSD due to the reported stressor event \r\nin service?  Further, in line with the \r\nM21-1 provisions, the examiner is \r\nrequested to provide detailed medical \r\nanalysis and interpretation of the \r\ndiagnoses found present on examination in \r\nlight of all the evidence of record for \r\nthe purpose of addressing whether any \r\nbehavioral changes that occurred at or \r\nclose in time to the alleged stressor \r\nincidents could possibly indicate the \r\noccurrence of one or more of the alleged \r\nin-service stressors.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner must explain the rationale \r\nfor all opinions given.\r\n\r\n4.  Thereafter, readjudicate the \r\nVeteran's claim.  If it remains denied, \r\nthe RO should issue an appropriate \r\nsupplemental statement of the case and \r\nafford the Veteran and her representative \r\nthe opportunity to respond.  The case \r\nshould then be returned to the Board, if \r\nin order, for further appellate review.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky \r\nv. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.

Doan, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active military service from December 1973 to \r\nDecember 1974 and from March 1981 to April 1983.\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal of a July 2003 rating action of the Department of \r\nVeterans' Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in New Orleans, \r\nLouisiana, that declined to reopen the claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran provided testimony to the undersigned Acting \r\nVeterans Law Judge via videoconference hearing in August \r\n2006.  A copy of the transcript has been associated with the \r\nfile.\r\n\r\nIn January 2007, the Board reopened the claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD and remanded the reopened claim for \r\nadditional development.  \r\n\r\nIn March 2009, the Veteran indicated that she had more \r\ninformation and evidence to submit and requested that VA wait \r\n30 days prior to adjudication of the appeal.  This period of \r\ntime has passed without the submission of addition evidence.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nJurisdiction\r\n\r\nOne of the matters the Board must address is which issue or \r\nissues are properly before it at this time.  Under \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 7105(a), an appeal to the Board must be \r\ninitiated by a notice of disagreement (NOD) and completed by \r\na substantive appeal after a statement of the case (SOC) is \r\nfurnished to the claimant.  In essence, the following \r\nsequence is required: There must be a decision by the RO, the \r\nclaimant must express timely disagreement with the decision \r\n(NOD), VA must respond by explaining the basis for the \r\ndecision to the claimant (SOC), and finally the claimant, \r\nafter receiving adequate notice of the basis of the decision, \r\nmust complete the process by stating his argument in a \r\ntimely-filed substantive appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. �� 20.200, \r\n20.201, 20.202, and 20.203.\r\n\r\nThe issue of service connection for PTSD is clearly before \r\nthe Board.  In the May 2009 post-remand brief, the \r\nrepresentative considered the issue on appeal to a broader \r\nissue of entitlement to service connection for an acquired \r\npsychiatric disorder.  The Board disagrees.\r\n\r\nIn this context, the Board is cognizant of the recent \r\ndecision by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans \r\nClaims (Court) in Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) \r\nthat found that the scope of a mental health disability claim \r\nincludes any mental disability that may reasonably be \r\nencompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, \r\nreported symptoms, and the other information of record.  \r\n\r\nNotably, the Clemons Court involved a situation where \r\nmultiple diagnoses for a psychiatric disorder existed, where \r\none of the underlying symptoms of these diagnoses was noted \r\nin service, and where no prior final VA decision had been \r\nmade on any diagnosis.  In this context, the Court \r\nessentially held that the appellant (given his lay \r\nperspective) was reasonably requesting benefits for symptoms \r\nof a mental condition which should be broadly construed and \r\nadjudicated, however the condition was diagnosed.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Clemons Court specifically noted limitations in \r\nits scope of claim rule when multiple diagnoses exist, and \r\none of those diagnoses had been subject to a prior final \r\ndenial.  For example, the Court cited the decision in Ephraim \r\nv. Brown, 82 F.3d 399 (Fed. Cir. 1996) which held that a \r\nclaim for service connection for PTSD was separate from a \r\nclaim for an increased rating for a different mental \r\ncondition that was already service-connected.  The \r\ndistinction being made that a prior final decision on a \r\nparticular diagnosis had been reached, and the rules of \r\nfinality under 38 U.S.C.A. � 7104 could not be simply \r\nabrogated.  In this situation, the separate diagnoses were \r\nproperly considered separate claims.\r\n\r\nIn this instant case, the issue of entitlement to service \r\nconnection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, as a \r\nseparate issue than service connection for PTSD, was \r\npreviously denied, to include in an April 1996 Board \r\ndecision.  Review of the claims file indicates that this \r\nissue has previously been developed at length, to include the \r\nobtainment of an Independent Medical Expert (IME) opinion.  \r\n\r\nThe January 2003 claim from which the instant appeal stems \r\ncomes from a request for service connection for PTSD only.  \r\nAs the Veteran has previously separately pursued a claim for \r\nan acquired psychiatric disorder [other than PTSD], and that \r\ndecision is final, the Board finds that her limitation of the \r\nclaim to PTSD was an informed choice to only pursue service \r\nconnection for this psychiatric disability at this time.  \r\nTherefore, the only issue before the Board is a claim of \r\nservice connection for PTSD.  Clemons, 23 Vet. App. at 8-9; \r\nEphraim, 82 F.3d 399 (Fed. Cit. 1996)\r\n\r\nThe Veteran, of course, is free to file an application to \r\nreopen the previously denied claim.\r\n\r\nStressor adjudication\r\n\r\nIn January 2007, the Board issued a remand directive ordering \r\nthe RO to make a specific determination, based upon the \r\ncomplete record, with respect to whether the Veteran was a \r\nvictim of a personal (sexual assault) in service.  This was \r\nto be accomplished prior to scheduling the Veteran for VA \r\nPTSD examination.\r\n\r\nThere is no indication of record that the RO adjudicated the \r\nVeteran's claimed personal (sexual assault) stressor.  A \r\nremand by the Board confers upon the Veteran, as a matter of \r\nlaw, the right to compliance with the remand instructions, \r\nand imposes upon VA a concomitant duty to ensure compliance \r\nwith the terms of the remand.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. \r\nApp. 268, 271 (1998).  This issue, therefore, must be \r\naddressed by the RO. \r\n\r\n\r\nPTSD diagnosis\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for disability \r\nresulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted \r\nin the line of duty, or from aggravation of a preexisting \r\ninjury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty.  See \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  Service \r\nconnection generally requires evidence of a current \r\ndisability with a relationship or connection to an injury or \r\ndisease or some other manifestation of the disability during \r\nservice.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. \r\n2000).  \r\n\r\nService connection is not warranted without evidence of a \r\ncurrently diagnosed disability.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 \r\nF.3d 1328, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (holding that the existence \r\nof a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA \r\ndisability compensation).\r\n\r\nEstablishment of service connection for PTSD \r\nrequires:  (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; (2) credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor \r\nactually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between \r\ncurrent symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  See also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. \r\nApp. 128 (1997).  \r\n\r\nA diagnosis of PTSD must be established in accordance with \r\n38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a), which simply mandates that, for VA \r\npurposes, all mental disorder diagnoses must conform to the \r\n4th edition of the American Psychiatric Association's \r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-\r\nIV).  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  The Court has taken judicial \r\nnotice of the mental health profession's adoption of the DSM-\r\nIV as well as its more liberalizing standards to establish a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD.  The Court acknowledged the change from an \r\nobjective \"would evoke . . . in almost anyone\" standard in \r\nassessing whether a stressor is sufficient to trigger PTSD to \r\na subjective standard (e.g., whether a person's exposure to a \r\ntraumatic event and response involved intense fear, \r\nhelplessness, or horror).  Thus, as noted by the Court, a \r\nmore susceptible person could have PTSD under the DSM-IV \r\ncriteria given his or her exposure to a traumatic event that \r\nwould not necessarily have the same effect on \"almost \r\neveryone.\"  Cohen, 10 Vet. App. 128, 140-141 (1997).\r\n\r\nThe Board observes that this is an exceptionally complex \r\ncase.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the Veteran's psychiatric impairment since 1975 \r\nhas eluded a consistent diagnosis.  For example, she has been \r\nvariously diagnosed with postpartum depression; depressive \r\nneurosis; dysthymic disorder; anxiety disorder not otherwise \r\nspecified (NOS); major depression, probably unipolar; \r\nborderline personality disorder; bipolar disorder; emotional \r\ntension; alcohol dependence; depression; and recurrent \r\ndepression interspersed recurrent mania precipitated \r\npostpartum.  \r\n\r\nIn light of the diagnostic difficulties, a psychiatric IME \r\nopinion was obtained in August 1995 wherein the examiner \r\nconcluded that the Veteran manifested a bipolar disorder and \r\npossibly a personality disorder with histrionic and possibly \r\nborderline features.\r\n\r\nWith respect to a PTSD diagnosis, a VA Compensation and \r\nPension (C&P) examination in August 1992 resulted in the \r\nexaminer's conclusion that it was difficult to support a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD based upon conflicting information.  The \r\nexaminer specifically stated that the Veteran met some of the \r\ncriteria for PTSD, but that some of these criteria could also \r\nbe used to support a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder or \r\nmajor depression.\r\n\r\nA February 1995 VA psychology note diagnosed the Veteran with \r\nPTSD.  The Veteran reported stressors of witnessing a \r\nconstruction worker killed by heavy machinery and being \r\nassaulted by her Commanding Officer at the age of 21.  This \r\ndiagnosis was based upon interview, mental status examination \r\nand psychological testing.  She was noted to experience a \r\n\"full-range of PTSD secondary to previously described \r\nstressors.\"  Notably, this assessment was not made based \r\nupon review of the Veteran's complex psychiatric history.\r\n\r\nA June 1997 VA C&P examination, based upon review of the \r\nclaims folder and psychological testing, concluded that the \r\nVeteran did not meet the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis as the \r\n\"symptoms she does have seem to affect her only in a minor \r\nway.\"\r\n\r\nA June 1998 VA C&P examination diagnosed the Veteran with \r\nbipolar disorder, anxiety disorder not otherwise specified, \r\nand alcohol dependence (in remission).  The examiner opined \r\nthat, even though the Veteran had some symptoms of PTSD, the \r\nVeteran did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD.  The \r\nexaminer continued by noting that perhaps the Veteran did at \r\none point in time have PTSD but the examiner could not \r\njustify making a PTSD diagnosis at that time.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the record reflects that the Veteran has been \r\ntreated, at times, in the VA clinical setting for PTSD.  The \r\nbasis for the diagnosis is not fully explained.\r\n\r\nStatements from a VA clinical psychologist in July 2004 and \r\nMay 2005 noted that the Veteran had been receiving VA \r\ntreatment for bipolar mood disorder and PTSD.  The Veteran's \r\nPTSD was said to be attributable to a rape in the military \r\nand witnessing a man being killed by a piece of machinery.  \r\nThe Veteran's various symptoms were reported, but an \r\nexplanation as to how the Veteran met the DSM-IV criteria for \r\na PTSD diagnosis was not explained.\r\n\r\nA January 2009 VA C&P examination, based upon review of the \r\nclaims folder and psychological testing, concluded that the \r\nVeteran did not meet the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis for \r\nthe reported stressors of being raped and witnessing the \r\ndeath of a civilian while she was in the military.  However, \r\nexaminer was less than clear as to which DSM-IV criterion had \r\nnot been met.\r\n\r\nThe Board first observes that it is aware of the Court's \r\nholding in McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007), \r\nwhich held that the requirement of a current disability is \r\nsatisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a \r\nclaim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the \r\npendency of that claim even if resolved prior to VA's final \r\nadjudication.  In McClain, the Board denied a claim of \r\nservice connection for a psychiatric disability on the basis \r\nof no current disability.  Notably, the Board had implicitly \r\nfound that a psychiatric disability had existed during the \r\nappeal period but completely resolved.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the Veteran does hold a diagnosis of PTSD by VA \r\nclinicians.  In reopening this case in January 2007, the \r\nBoard presumed a current diagnosis of PTSD for purposes of \r\nreopening the claim, as required by applicable caselaw.  See \r\nJustus v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 510, 513 (1993).  However, \r\nthe Board specifically noted that the conflict of evidence \r\nconcerning whether the Veteran manifested PTSD and that there \r\nremained \"some question as to the true nature of the \r\n[V]eteran's current psychiatric disability.\"  Unlike \r\nMcClain, there has been no finding that the Veteran ever \r\nmanifested PTSD according to the governing criteria of \r\n38 C.F.R. � 4.125.\r\n\r\nThe Board next observes the Court's cautions in Mariano v. \r\nPrincipi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003), wherein the Court \r\nindicated that it is not permissible for VA to undertake \r\nadditional development for the purpose of developing negative \r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nThe favorable opinions in this case diagnosing PTSD are \r\nbased, in part, upon the Veteran's alleged stressor of having \r\nbeing raped during service and are rendered without any \r\nbenefit of review of the claims folder.  As noted by the \r\nBoard in the January 2007, the Veteran has blamed at least \r\nseven different individuals for this attack over the years \r\nand has a history of various examiner's arriving at a \r\nconsistent diagnosis.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, as indicated above, the RO has failed to \r\nadjudicate the alleged personal assault stressor, as \r\ninstructed by the Board in the January 2007 remand \r\ndirectives.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the record contains conflicting opinions by various \r\nexaminers as to whether the DSM-IV criteria for a PTSD \r\ndiagnosis have been met, and the Board cannot discern from \r\neither the favorable or unfavorable opinions the exact basis \r\nas to how all DSM-IV criteria have been met.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Veteran's representative argued in the May 2009 \r\nPost-Remand Brief that additional development of this claim \r\nmay be required.\r\n\r\nAs noted in Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 \r\n(2008), guiding factors to be considered in resolving \r\ndifferences of expert medical opinion include whether (1) the \r\ntestimony is based upon sufficient facts or data; (2) the \r\ntestimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; \r\nand (3) the expert witness has applied the principles and \r\nmethods reliably to the facts of the case.\r\n\r\nAs held in Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007), \r\na medical opinion must support its conclusion with an \r\nanalysis the Board can consider and weigh against other \r\nevidence in the record.\r\n\r\nOverall, the favorable opinions in this case are not based \r\nupon sufficient facts, some of which remained to be \r\nadjudicated, and the Board can find no adequate basis in the \r\nfavorable or unfavorable opinions to weigh against the \r\nothers.  None of these opinions explicitly recognize the \r\nbasis for the contrary opinions and explain why those \r\nconclusions are wrong.  As such, the Board finds ample and \r\nnecessary basis to remand this case for additional medical \r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nAs with the prior need for an IME in 1998, the evidence now \r\nbefore the Board is convincing that an extensive VA \r\npsychiatric examination by a panel of three Board-Certified \r\nPsychiatrists in necessary to resolve this appeal.  The Board \r\nhas considered an additional IME opinion.  However, the Board \r\nis of the opinion that the point of dispute in this case \r\nappears to be the examiner impressions upon interviewing the \r\nVeteran's description of symptoms which can only be resolved \r\nwith an actual in person psychiatric examination.\r\n\r\nOther development\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the Veteran's representative raised for the \r\nfirst time argument that there has been incomplete \r\ndevelopment of the claim as it pertains to obtaining medical \r\nrecords.  In particular, the representative argued that \r\nadditional searches should be made for treatment records at \r\n\"a Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia\" and treatment at \r\n\"Ft. Devens mental health clinic in 1974.\"\r\n\r\nThe RO has been unable to obtain service treatment records \r\n(STRs) pertaining to the Veteran's first period of active \r\nservice.  On remand, however, the Board will request that \r\ndirect searches be conducted in the facilities and dates \r\nidentified.  See Sheed v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 256, 259 \r\n(1992).\r\n\r\nFinally, the Veteran's claims folder reflects that the \r\nVeteran had her disability benefits with the Social Security \r\nAdministration (SSA) restored in approximately 2004.  It is \r\nunclear whether she underwent additional examination.  On \r\nremand, the RO should request any additional available \r\ndocumentation from SSA since 2004.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Obtain the Veteran's complete medical \r\nfile from the New Orleans VAMC since \r\nFebruary 2007 and associate it with the \r\nclaims folders.\r\n\r\n2.  Request from SSA any medical records \r\nand legal documents pertaining to the \r\nVeteran's reinstatement of benefits in \r\napproximately 2004.\r\n\r\n3.  Conduct direct searches for any \r\navailable STRs at the following locations:\r\n\r\na) Fort Devens Mental Health Clinic \r\nfrom 1974 to 1975; and\r\n    \r\nb) Norfolk Naval Base Emergency room in \r\nOctober 1974.\r\n    \r\n4.  Following the above, make a specific \r\ndetermination, based upon the complete \r\nrecord, with respect to whether the \r\nVeteran was the victim of a personal \r\n(sexual) assault in service.  In reaching \r\nthis determination, address any \r\ncredibility questions raised by the \r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n5.  Next, arrange for the Veteran to be \r\nafforded a VA psychiatric examination by a \r\npanel of three Board-certified \r\npsychiatrists.  The claims folders, to \r\ninclude a copy of this Remand and any \r\nadditional evidence secured, must be made \r\navailable to and reviewed by the examiner \r\nprior to completion of the examination \r\nreport, and the examination report must \r\nreflect that the claims folders were \r\nreviewed.  Any indicated studies should be \r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nIt must be specified for the examiners the \r\nstressor or stressors that are established \r\nby the record and the examiners must be \r\ninstructed that only those events may be \r\nconsidered for the purpose of determining \r\nwhether the Veteran was exposed to a \r\nstressor in service.  At this time, only \r\nthe Veteran's stressor of witnessing the \r\ndeath of a construction worker for the \r\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers when he got \r\ncaught in a drilling rig has been \r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nBased on a through review of the claims \r\nfolder, and the examination findings, the \r\npanel should provide a consensus opinion \r\naddressing the following (if a consensus \r\nopinion cannot be achieved, the reasons for \r\nthat must be explained by the panel in \r\nwriting):\r\n\r\nDetermine whether the Veteran manifests \r\nPTSD according to the DSM-IV criteria, \r\nfully explaining how each criterion have \r\nbeen met or not met.  If PTSD is \r\ndiagnosed, specify each stressor deemed of \r\nsufficient gravity to produce PTSD.  In \r\narriving at this opinion, the examiner \r\nshould provide a rationale for the \r\nopinions expressed.  If an opinion cannot \r\nbe medically determined without resort to \r\nmere speculation or conjecture, this \r\nshould be commented upon in the report.\r\n\r\nThe examiner's are requested to reconcile \r\ntheir ultimate diagnosis with the varying \r\nexaminer impressions of record, including \r\nVA C&P examinations in 1992, 1997, 1998 \r\nand 2009 as well as VA clinician \r\nimpressions.\r\n\r\n6.  Following completion of the foregoing, \r\nreadjudicate the claim.  If any benefit \r\nsought on appeal remains denied, the \r\nVeteran and her representative should be \r\nprovided a supplemental statement of the \r\ncase (SSOC) and allowed an appropriate \r\nperiod of time for response.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.

Berry, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from October 1973 to \r\nOctober 1993.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from a rating decision dated in January 2004 by the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nColumbia, South Carolina.\r\n\r\nIn September 2008, the Board remanded this matter to the RO \r\nfor a VA examination and opinion.  The RO continued the \r\ndenial of the claim (as reflected in the August 2009 \r\nsupplemental statement of the case (SSOC)) and returned this \r\nmatter to the Board for further appellate consideration.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Board observes that the September 2008 Board remand \r\nrequested that the Veteran be provided with a VA examination \r\nand opinion addressing the question of whether it is more \r\nlikely than not, at least as likely as no or less likely than \r\nnot (i.e., probability less than 50 percent) that the \r\nVeteran's service-connected residuals of head trauma or PTSD \r\ncaused or aggravated his hypertension.  The VA examiner \r\nprovided the opinion that the Veteran's hypertension is not \r\nlikely to be aggravated by his PTSD.  The VA examiner did not \r\naddress the question of whether the Veteran's PTSD caused the \r\nVeteran's hypertension and he did not address at all the \r\nissue of whether the Veteran's residuals of a head trauma \r\ncaused or aggravated the Veteran's hypertension.  Thus, the \r\nBoard finds that a remand is necessary in order to develop \r\nthe Veteran's claim in accordance with the Board's previous \r\nremand directives.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 \r\n(1998) (as a matter of law, a remand by the Board confers on \r\nthe Veteran the right to compliance with the remand orders).  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Board notes that the VA examiner did not \r\nprovide a rationale for his opinion.  The probative value of \r\na medical opinion comes from when it is the factually \r\naccurate, fully articulated, and sound reasoning for the \r\nconclusion, not the mere fact that the claims file was \r\nreviewed.  Nieves- Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 \r\n(2008).  Thus, a remand is also necessary in order for the \r\nexaminer to provide a rationale for his opinions.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.\tThe RO should provide the claims \r\nfolder to the VA examiner who \r\nconducted the VA examination in \r\nDecember 2008 for an opinion.  The \r\nexaminer is requested to review all \r\npertinent records associated with the \r\nclaims file and offer an opinion as to \r\nwhether it is more likely than not \r\n(i.e., probably greater than 50 \r\npercent), at least as likely as not \r\n(i.e., probability of 50 percent), or \r\nless likely than not (i.e., \r\nprobability less than 50 percent), \r\nthat the Veteran's service-connected \r\nresiduals of head trauma and/or PTSD \r\ncaused or aggravated his hypertension.  \r\nThe examiner should also provide an \r\nopinion on whether the Veteran's \r\nhypertension is as likely as not \r\n(i.e., probability of 50 percent) \r\nrelated to active military service or \r\nany symptomatology shown in service.  \r\nThe examiner is requested to include a \r\nrationale for all conclusions and \r\nconfirm that the claims file was \r\navailable for review.  L\r\n\r\n2.\tIf the examiner who conducted the \r\nDecember 2008 VA examination is \r\nunavailable, then the RO should \r\nprovide the Veteran with a VA \r\nexamination from a cardiologist or \r\nhypertensionologist to determine the \r\netiology of the Veteran's \r\nhypertension.  All indicated \r\nevaluations, studies, and tests deemed \r\nnecessary should be accomplished and \r\nall findings reported in detail.  The \r\nclaims file should be made available \r\nfor review in connection with the \r\nexamination.  The examiner is \r\nrequested to review all pertinent \r\nrecords associated with the claims \r\nfile and offer an opinion as to \r\nwhether it is more likely than not \r\n(i.e., probably greater than 50 \r\npercent), at least as likely as not \r\n(i.e., probability of 50 percent), or \r\nless likely than not (i.e., \r\nprobability less than 50 percent), \r\nthat the Veteran's service-connected \r\nresiduals of head trauma and/or PTSD \r\ncaused or aggravated his hypertension.  \r\nThe examiner should also provide an \r\nopinion on whether the Veteran's \r\nhypertension is as likely as not \r\n(i.e., probability of 50 percent) \r\nrelated to active military service or \r\nany symptomatology shown in service.  \r\nThe examiner should include a \r\nrationale for his or her conclusions \r\nand confirm that the claims file was \r\navailable for review.  \r\n\r\n3.\tUpon completion of the foregoing, the \r\nRO should readjudicate the Veteran's \r\nclaim of entitlement to service \r\nconnection for hypertension, based on \r\na review of the entire evidentiary \r\nrecord.  If the benefit sought on \r\nappeal remains denied, the RO should \r\nprovide the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative with a supplemental \r\nstatement of the case and the \r\nopportunity to respond thereto.  \r\nThereafter, the case should be \r\nreturned to the Board for further \r\nappellate consideration, if in order.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v.

Connolly, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active military service from November 1965 to \r\nNovember 1967.\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal of a September 2006 rating action of the Department \r\nof Veterans' Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Waco, \r\nTexas.  In July 2007, the Board remanded this issue.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's PTSD diagnoses have not been attributed to a \r\nverified in-service stressor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by the veteran's \r\nactive service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 2002 & Supp. 2009); \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)) (2008).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the claimant's claim, VA has met all \r\nstatutory and regulatory notice and duty to assist \r\nprovisions.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, \r\n5106, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326. \r\n\r\nPrior to the initial adjudication of the claimant's claim, a \r\nVCAA letter was sent to the claimant which fully satisfied \r\nthe duty to notify provisions.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a); \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. \r\n183, 187 (2002).  Thereafter, additional notification letters \r\npertaining to this claim and to the verification of the \r\nclaimed stressors were also sent to the claimant.  The \r\nclaimant was aware that it was ultimately the claimant's \r\nresponsibility to give VA any evidence pertaining to the \r\nclaim.  The VCAA letter told the claimant to provide any \r\nrelevant evidence in the claimant's possession.  See \r\nPelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 120-21 (2004) \r\n(Pelegrini II).  ).  In particular, the VCAA notification: \r\n(1) informed the claimant about the information and evidence \r\nnot of record that is necessary to substantiate the claim; \r\n(2) informed the claimant about the information and evidence \r\nthat VA will seek to provide; and (3) informed the claimant \r\nabout the information and evidence that the claimant is \r\nexpected to provide.  \r\n\r\nIn any event, the Board finds that any deficiency in the \r\nnotice to the claimant or the timing of these notices is \r\nharmless error.  See Overton v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 427, \r\n435 (2006) (finding that the Board erred by relying on \r\nvarious post-decisional documents to conclude that adequate \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) notice had been provided to the \r\nclaimant, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans \r\nClaims (Court) found that the evidence established that the \r\nclaimant was afforded a meaningful opportunity to participate \r\nin the adjudication of the claim, and found that the error \r\nwas harmless, as the Board has done in this case.)  \r\n\r\nIf any notice deficiency is present in this case, the Board \r\nfinds that any prejudice due to such error has been overcome \r\nin this case by the following: (1) based on the \r\ncommunications sent to the claimant over the course of this \r\nappeal, the claimant clearly has actual knowledge of the \r\nevidence the claimant is required to submit in this case; and \r\n(2) based on the claimant's contentions as well as the \r\ncommunications provided to the claimant by VA, it is \r\nreasonable to expect that the claimant understands what was \r\nneeded to prevail.  See Shinseki v. Sanders/Simmons, 129 \r\nS.Ct. 1696 (2009); Fenstermacher v. Phila. Nat'l Bank, 493 \r\nF.2d 333, 337 (3d Cir. 1974) (\"[N]o error can be predicated \r\non insufficiency of notice since its purpose had been \r\nserved.\").  In order for the Court to be persuaded that no \r\nprejudice resulted from a notice error, \"the record must \r\ndemonstrate that, despite the error, the adjudication was \r\nnevertheless essentially fair.\"  Dunlap v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. \r\nApp. 112, 118 (2007).\r\n\r\nVA also fulfilled its duty to obtain all relevant evidence \r\nwith respect to the issue on appeal.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A; \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.159.  The claimant's service treatment records, \r\nVA medical treatment records, and identified private medical \r\nrecords have been obtained, to the extent available, and \r\nsatisfy 38 C.F.R. � 3.326.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A; 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.159.  The claimant's personnel records were also \r\nobtained.  The U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research \r\nCenter (JSRRC) (formerly U.S. Armed Services Center for Unit \r\nRecords Research (CURR)) was also contacted in an effort to \r\nverify the claimed stressors.  The claimant has indicated \r\nthat he has no additional information regarding the \r\nstressors.  There is no indication in the record that any \r\nadditional evidence, relevant to the issue decided herein, is \r\navailable and not part of the claims file.  The claimant was \r\nnot afforded a VA examination, but VA outpatient medical \r\nrecords reflect a diagnosis of PTSD based on claimed \r\nstressors.  At issue in this case, rather, it whether there \r\nis a verified inservice stressor upon which the diagnosis may \r\nbe based.  This information cannot be gleaned from a VA \r\nexamination. \r\n \r\nThe Board recognizes that VA has recently taken steps to \r\nassist Veterans seeking compensation for Post-Traumatic \r\nStress Disorder (PTSD).  VA has published a proposed \r\nregulation in the Federal Register to make it easier for a \r\nVeteran to claim service connection for PTSD by reducing the \r\nevidence needed if the stressor claimed by a Veteran is \r\nrelated to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.  A \r\nfinal regulation will be published after consideration of all \r\ncomments received on this proposed regulation.  Under the new \r\nrule, VA would not require corroboration of a stressor \r\nrelated to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity if \r\na VA psychiatrist or psychologist confirms that the stressful \r\nexperience recalled by a Veteran adequately supports a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD and the Veteran's symptoms are related to \r\nthe claimed stressor.  Currently, as noted below, a PTSD \r\nclaim requires corroboration that a non-combat Veteran \r\nactually experienced a stressor related to hostile military \r\nactivity.  This new rule would simplify the development that \r\nis required for these cases.  In this case, the two claimed \r\nstressors do not relate to fear of hostile military or \r\nterrorist activity so the proposed regulation, if \r\nimplemented, would not apply.  \r\n\r\nThus, the Board also finds that a VA examination is not \r\nnecessary to determine whether his PTSD is related to his \r\nperiod of honorable service, as the standards of the recent \r\ndecision of the Court in McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. \r\n79 (2006), have not been met.  Under McLendon, VA must \r\nprovide a medical examination in a service connection claim \r\nwhen there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability \r\nor persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) \r\nevidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease \r\noccurred in service or establishing certain diseases \r\nmanifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which \r\nthe claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the \r\ndisability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a \r\ndisability may be associated with the veteran's service or \r\nwith another service-connected disability, but (4) \r\ninsufficient competent medical evidence on file for the VA to \r\nmake a decision on the claim.  Id at 81. \r\n\r\nIn this case, PTSD was not treated or diagnosed during \r\nservice.  Service connection is sought on the basis of PTSD \r\nhaving a delayed onset; however, as noted, the missing \r\nelement to establish service connection is a stressor related \r\nto service.  In light of these findings, McLendon criteria \r\nhave not been met.  Accordingly, the Board finds that no \r\nfurther action is necessary to meet the requirements of the \r\nVCAA or the Court.\r\n\r\nSince the Board has concluded that the preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against the claim of service connection, any \r\nquestions as to the appropriate disability rating or \r\neffective date to be assigned are rendered moot, and no \r\nfurther notice is needed.  See Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, \r\n19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).\r\n\r\nIn summary, the Board finds that \"it is difficult to discern \r\nwhat additional guidance VA could have provided to the \r\nveteran regarding what further evidence he should submit to \r\nsubstantiate his claim.\"  Conway v. Principi, 353 F.3d 1369 \r\n(Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Livesay v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. \r\n165, 178 (2001) (en banc) (observing that \"the VCAA is a \r\nreason to remand many, many claims, but it is not an excuse \r\nto remand all claims.\"); Reyes v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 113, \r\n116 (1994); Soyini v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 (1991) \r\n(both observing circumstances as to when a remand would not \r\nresult in any significant benefit to the claimant).\r\n\r\n\r\nService Connection for PTSD\r\n\r\nThe Veteran seeks service connection for PTSD.  Service \r\nconnection may be granted for a disability resulting from \r\ndisease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. �� 1110.  The regulation governing PTSD claims, 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.304(f), requires medical evidence diagnosing the \r\ncondition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a); a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence, between current symptoms and \r\nan in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that \r\nthe claimed in-service stressor occurred.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he developed PTSD as a result of \r\ntwo stressors experienced during active service.  \r\nSpecifically, the Veteran maintained that while on a training \r\nexercise, he witnessed two soldiers jumping from a smoking \r\nhelicopter in mid air.  It was reported that the helicopter \r\ncrashed and seven soldiers were killed.  In addition, he \r\ncontends that a soldier was killed on the firing range.  \r\n\r\nVA medical evidence dated after the Veteran was discharged \r\nfrom service satisfies the first and second elements of a \r\nPTSD claim under the criteria of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), \r\nbecause it shows that the Veteran has been diagnosed on \r\nmultiple occasions from December 2004 onward as having PTSD \r\nas a result of a stressful incident he reportedly experienced \r\nduring service (the helicopter incident).  Having submitted a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD and medical evidence linking PTSD to \r\nclaimed in-service stressors, the Board must now determine \r\nwhether the record contains credible supporting evidence that \r\nany of the claimed in-service stressors occurred.\r\n\r\nThe evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a \r\nrecognizable stressor during service to support a diagnosis \r\nof PTSD will vary depending upon whether the veteran engaged \r\nin \"combat with the enemy.\"  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b); 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.304(f); Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 \r\n(1993).  Participation in combat, a determination that is to \r\nbe made on a case by case basis, requires that the veteran \r\nhave personally participated in events constituting an actual \r\nfight or encounter with a military foe or hostile unit or \r\ninstrumentality.  See VAOPGCPREC 12-99 (October 18, 1999).  \r\nIn determining whether the veteran participated in combat, \r\nthe veteran's oral and written testimony will be weighed \r\ntogether with the other evidence of record.  Cohen v. Brown, \r\n10 Vet. App. 128, 146 (1997).\r\n\r\nIf VA determines a veteran engaged in combat with the enemy \r\nand his alleged stressor is combat-related, then his lay \r\ntestimony or statement is accepted as conclusive evidence of \r\nthe stressor's occurrence and no further development or \r\ncorroborative evidence is required - provided that such \r\ntestimony is found to be \"satisfactory,\" i.e., credible and \r\n\"consistent with circumstances, conditions or hardships of \r\nservice.\"  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f); \r\nZarycki, 6 Vet. App. at 98.  If, however, VA determines \r\neither that a veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy \r\nor that he did engage in combat, but that the alleged \r\nstressor is not combat related, then his lay testimony, in \r\nand of itself, is not sufficient to establish the occurrence \r\nof the alleged stressor.  Instead, the record must contain \r\nevidence that corroborate his testimony or statements.  See \r\nZarycki, 6 Vet. App. at 98.\r\n\r\nWhere a determination is made that a veteran did not \"engage \r\nin combat with the enemy,\" or that the claimed stressor is \r\nnot related to combat, the veteran's lay testimony alone will \r\nnot be enough to establish the occurrence of the alleged \r\nstressor.  In such cases, the record must contain service \r\nrecords or other corroborative evidence which substantiates \r\nor verifies a veteran's testimony or statements as to the \r\noccurrence of the claimed stressor.  See West (Carlton) v. \r\nBrown, 7 Vet. App. 70, 76 (1994); Zarycki, 6 Vet. App. at 98 \r\n(1993).  In Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, 290-91 (1994), \r\nthe Court stated that \"the absence of corroboration in the \r\nservice records, when there is nothing in the available \r\nrecords that is inconsistent with other evidence, does not \r\nrelieve the Board of its obligations to assess the \r\ncredibility and probative value of the other evidence.\"\r\n\r\nAs noted, in a precedent opinion, VA's General Counsel held \r\nthat the ordinary meaning of the phrase \"engaged in combat \r\nwith the enemy,\" as used in 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b), requires \r\nthat a veteran \"have participated in events constituting an \r\nactual fight or encounter with a military foe or hostile unit \r\nor instrumentality.\"  VAOPGCPREC 12-99.  The General Counsel \r\nalso indicated that the determination of whether a veteran \r\nengaged in combat with the enemy necessarily must be made on \r\na case-by-case basis, and that absence from a veteran's \r\nservice records of any ordinary indicators of combat service \r\nmay, in appropriate cases, support a reasonable inference \r\nthat the veteran did not engage in combat; such absence may \r\nproperly be considered \"negative evidence\" even though it \r\ndoes not affirmatively show that the veteran did not engage \r\nin combat.  Id.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the Veteran's DD 214 and personnel records do \r\nnot establish combat service.  They do not show that he \r\nreceived any commendations or awards typically awarded \r\nprimarily or exclusively for circumstances related to combat, \r\nsuch as the Combat Infantryman Badge, Purple Heart, or any \r\nother similar citation.  See id.  Moreover, the Veteran does \r\nnot contend that either stressor occurred during combat \r\noperations with the enemy.  Thus, combat service is not \r\nestablished nor asserted with regard to the claimed \r\nstressors.  \r\n\r\nSince the Veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy, \r\nhis stressors cannot be related to combat.  Rather, the \r\nrecord must contain service records or other corroborative \r\nevidence that substantiates or verifies the Veteran's \r\nstatements as to the occurrence of the claimed stressors.\r\n\r\nAs noted, in Doran, the Court stated that \"the absence of \r\ncorroboration in the service records, when there is nothing \r\nin the available records that is inconsistent with other \r\nevidence, does not relieve the Board of its obligations to \r\nassess the credibility and probative value of the other \r\nevidence.\"  In the three previously noted cases, the Court \r\ncited a provision of the VA ADJUDICATION PROCEDURE MANUAL \r\nM21-1 (MANUAL 21-1), which has now been revised as to \r\n\"Evidence of Stressors in Service\" to read, in part, ... \r\n\"[C]orroborating evidence of a stressor is not restricted to \r\nservice records, but may be obtained from other sources.\"  \r\nSince the MANUAL 21-1 October 1995 revision, the Court has \r\nheld that the requirement in 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) for \r\n\"credible supporting evidence \" means that the \"appellant's \r\ntestimony, by itself, cannot establish the occurrence of a \r\nnoncombat stressor.\"  See Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, \r\n395 (1996); Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 166 (1996).\r\n\r\nIn August 2006, the RO made a formal findings that there was \r\na lack of information to verify the Veteran's stressors.  The \r\nBoard remanded this case to obtain additional more specific \r\ninformation from the Veteran.  This information has been \r\nrepeatedly requested.  The Veteran furnished information \r\nregarding the time frame of the claimed stressors; however, \r\nhe did not provide the names of any inservice casualties, as \r\nrequested, and he has stated that he does not know any of the \r\nnames.  The stressor information was sent to JSRRC which \r\nfurnished a response.  With regard to the helicopter \r\nincident, JSRRC searched the United States Army and Air Force \r\naircraft accident/incident reports for February 1966 (claimed \r\ndate of occurrence), but the search was negative.  In \r\naddition, JSRRC searched the United States Military Casualty \r\nReports, but there was no documentation of the claimed \r\nincident.  With regard to the firing range incident, JSRRC \r\nsearched the United States Military Casualty Reports, but \r\nthere was no documentation of any incident where a soldier \r\nwas shot on the firing range at For Hood, Texas, in December \r\n1965, as claimed by the Veteran.  \r\n\r\nIn this case, there is no verified stressor to serve as a \r\nbasis for granting the Veteran's PTSD claim.  The Veteran was \r\nnotified that using the information he has provided, JSRRC \r\nsearched pertinent data to verify the claimed stressors, but \r\nthe results were negative and he could submit additional \r\nspecific information, such as the names of the claimed \r\ncasualties.  However, he stated that he has no further \r\ninformation.  Without additional details, another search \r\nwould be futile.  See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 \r\n(1991) (holding that it is not an impossible or onerous task \r\nfor appellants who claim entitlement to service connection \r\nfor PTSD to supply the names, dates and places of events \r\nclaimed to support a PTSD stressor).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has not submitted evidence showing that he \r\nengaged in combat and he claims that the stressors were not \r\nrelated to enemy activity.  JSRRC determined that the events \r\nas presented by him were not corroborated.  Thus, his PTSD \r\ndiagnoses have not been attributed to a verified in-service \r\nstressor.  As such, the Board finds that the preponderance of \r\nthe evidence is against the Veteran's claim for entitlement \r\nto service connection for PTSD.  The Veteran's statements \r\nregarding the two claimed stressful events and a statement \r\nfrom his wife that he has PTSD are insufficient to establish \r\nthe occurrence of the claimed stressors in this case.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, service connection for PTSD must be denied.  In \r\nreaching this decision, the Board considered the doctrine of \r\nreasonable doubt; however, as the preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against the Veteran's claim, the doctrine is not \r\nfor application.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nP.M.

C. Dale, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active duty service from August 1973 to July \r\n1975.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a March 2005 rating decision by a \r\nRegional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs \r\n(VA).  The Veteran was afforded a July 2009 Travel Board \r\nhearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge.  The \r\nhearing transcript is associated with the record.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThis appeal is remanded to obtain outstanding records and to \r\nafford the Veteran a VA psychiatric examination.  The record \r\nindicates that the Veteran began receiving  \r\nSocial Security Administration (SSA) benefits during the \r\npendency of the appeal.  The RO/AMC must contact SSA to \r\nobtain their records.  The record also shows that there are \r\noutstanding treatment records.  At the Travel Board hearing, \r\nthe Veteran testified that he continued psychiatric treatment \r\nat a \"Veteran's home\" in Yountville, California.  The \r\nRO/AMC must attempt to locate these treatment records.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(2).  \r\n\r\nLastly, the Veteran will be afforded a VA psychiatric \r\nexamination by an appropriately qualified healthcare \r\nprovider.  The claims file and a copy of this remand must be \r\nmade available for review by the examiner.  The examiner is \r\nasked to review the claims file, interview the Veteran, and \r\ndetermine all psychiatric diagnosis or diagnoses present in \r\naccordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of \r\nMental Disorders, Fourth Edition, of the American Psychiatric \r\nAssociation (DSM- IV).  For each diagnosis rendered, the \r\nexaminer must opine as to whether it is related to any \r\nincident of active service.  The examiner must also furnish a \r\nmedical opinion as to whether he or she believes the reported \r\nin-service personal assaults occurred.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f)(4).   \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1. The RO/AMC must obtain the Veteran's \r\nSSA records and treatment records located \r\nat a \"Veteran's home\" at 100 California \r\nDrive Yountville, California 94599, as \r\nidentified at the July 2009 Travel Board \r\nhearing.  All necessary authorizations for \r\nreleasing the records must be provided to \r\nthe Veteran.   \r\n\r\n2.  After the records listed above have \r\nbeen obtained, the AMC/RO will schedule \r\nthe Veteran for a psychiatric examination.  \r\nThe claims file will be made available for \r\nreview by the examiner and the examiner \r\nshould state that he or she reviewed the \r\nclaims file and a copy of this remand in \r\nany report generated.  After examining the \r\nVeteran, the examiner must report:\r\n\r\n(a) All present psychiatric diagnosis \r\nor diagnoses meeting DSM-IV criteria.  \r\n\r\n(b) For each DSM-IV diagnosis \r\nrendered, the examiner must state \r\nwhether it is related to any incident \r\nof active military service. \r\n\r\n3. The AMC/RO should review the claims \r\nfile to ensure that all of the requested \r\ndevelopment has been completed to the \r\nextent possible.  In particular, the RO \r\nshould review the requested examination \r\nreport and required medical opinion to \r\nensure that it is responsive to and in \r\ncomplete compliance with the directives of \r\nthis remand and if they are not, the RO \r\nshould implement corrective procedures. \r\nStegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).\r\n\r\n4. After completion of the above, and any \r\nadditional development of the evidence, \r\nthe RO should review the record, to \r\ninclude all additional evidence, and \r\nreadjudicate the claim.  If any benefits \r\nsought remain denied, the Veteran and his \r\nrepresentative should be issued an \r\nappropriate supplemental statement of the \r\ncase, and afforded the opportunity to \r\nrespond.  The case should then be returned \r\nto the Board for further appellate review, \r\nif otherwise in order.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2009).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nN.

Armstrong, Law Clerk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty from \r\nJanuary 1977 to May 1986.  This matter is before the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2006 \r\nrating decision of the Waco, Texas Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In the Veteran's April \r\n2007 VA Form 9, substantive appeal, he requested a Travel \r\nBoard hearing.  Such hearing was scheduled for September \r\n2009.  In August 2009 the Veteran stated that he was \r\nincarcerated and would be unable to attend the hearing unless \r\nVA could arrange for transportation and security.  Under \r\ngoverning regulation, the Board may not provide such \r\nservices.  See 38 C.F.R. � 20.712.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1. The Veteran is not shown to have engaged in combat; there \r\nis no credible supporting evidence that a claimed in-service \r\nstressor occurred; any recorded diagnosis of PTSD is not \r\nbased on a stressor event corroborated by independent and \r\ncredible supporting evidence.\r\n\r\n2. Depressive disorder NOS, adjustment disorder with anxiety \r\nand depression, personality disorder NOS with mixed traits, \r\nor dysthymia were not manifested in, or shown to be related \r\nto, the Veteran's service; a psychosis was not manifested in \r\nthe first postservice year; a personality disorder (of \r\nitself) is not a disease or injury.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nService connection for variously diagnosed psychiatric \r\ndisorder to include PTSD is not warranted.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n�� 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 4.125 (2009).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nA. Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nThe VCAA, in part, describes VA's duties to notify and assist \r\nclaimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126; \r\n38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a).  The VCAA \r\napplies to the instant claim.  \r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete \r\napplication for benefits, VA is required to notify the \r\nclaimant and his or her representative of any information, \r\nand any medical or lay evidence, not of record (1) that is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to \r\nprovide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b); Quartuccio v. \r\nPrincipi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  VCAA notice requirements \r\napply to all five elements of a service connection claim: 1) \r\nveteran status; 2) existence of a disability; 3) a connection \r\nbetween the Veteran's service and the disability; 4) degree \r\nof disability; and 5) effective date of the disability.  \r\nDingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 484-86 \r\n(2006), aff'd, 483 F.3d 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  VCAA notice \r\nshould be provided to a claimant before the initial \r\nunfavorable agency of original jurisdiction decision on a \r\nclaim.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. \r\n2006).  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was advised of VA's duties to notify and assist \r\nin the development of his claim prior to its initial \r\nadjudication.  An August 2004 letter explained the evidence \r\nnecessary to substantiate his claim, the evidence VA was \r\nresponsible for providing, and the evidence he was \r\nresponsible for providing.  A June 2006 letter informed the \r\nVeteran of disability rating and effective date criteria.  He \r\nhas had ample opportunity to respond/supplement the record \r\nand has not alleged that notice in this case was less than \r\nadequate.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) and pertinent \r\npostservice treatment records have been secured.  He has not \r\nidentified any pertinent evidence that remains outstanding.  \r\nThe RO did not arrange for a VA examination or seek a medical \r\nopinion as such is not warranted.  Absent evidence that any \r\ncurrent psychiatric diagnosis is related to service a medical \r\nnexus opinion is not warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c); \r\nMcLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83 (2006).  VA's duty \r\nto assist is met.  Accordingly, the Board will address the \r\nmerits of the claim. \r\n\r\nB. Legal Criteria, Factual Background, and Analysis\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for disability due to \r\ndisease or injury that was incurred in or aggravated by \r\nactive service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  \r\nService connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed \r\nafter discharge, when all the evidence, including that \r\npertinent to service, establishes that the disability was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nIn order to establish service connection for a claimed \r\ndisability, there must be: (1) medical evidence of a current \r\ndisability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay \r\nevidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease \r\nor injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the \r\nclaimed in-service disease or injury and the current \r\ndisability.  Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).  \r\nThe determination as to whether these requirements are met is \r\nbased on an analysis of all the evidence of record and an \r\nevaluation of its credibility and probative value. Baldwin v. \r\nWest, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 4.125(a); (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed \r\nin-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical \r\nevidence of a link, or causal nexus, between current \r\nsymptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nWhere the veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy, or \r\nthe claimed stressors are not related to combat, then the \r\nveteran's testimony alone is not sufficient to establish the \r\noccurrence of the claimed stressors, and his testimony must \r\nbe corroborated by credible supporting evidence.  Cohen v. \r\nBrown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).\r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative \r\nevidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the \r\ndetermination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in \r\nresolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102.  When all of the \r\nevidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining \r\nwhether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative \r\nequipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or \r\nwhether a fair preponderance of the evidence is against the \r\nclaim, in which case the claim is denied.  Gilbert v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990).\r\n\r\nInitially, the Board notes that it has reviewed all of the \r\nevidence in the Veteran's claims file, with an emphasis on \r\nthe evidence relevant to this appeal.  Although the Board has \r\nan obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting its \r\ndecision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, every piece \r\nof evidence of record.  Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, \r\n1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that VA must review the \r\nentire record, but does not have to discuss each piece of \r\nevidence).  Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant \r\nevidence where appropriate and the Board's analysis below \r\nwill focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails \r\nto show, as to the claim. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's STRs are silent for psychiatric complaints, \r\nfindings, treatment, or diagnosis. \r\n\r\n1998 St. Joseph Hospital treatment records reveal that the \r\nVeteran was seen following a suicide attempt after having \r\nproblems with his live-in girlfriend.  It was noted that he \r\nhad a similar reaction a year prior following an argument \r\nwith a girlfriend.  The Veteran was in a predominantly \r\ndysphoric mood.  The AXIS I diagnosis was adjustment disorder \r\nwith depressed mood and the AXIS IV diagnosis was \r\npsychosocial stressors including problems in the Veteran's \r\nprimary relationship.  \r\n\r\nVA outpatient treatment records from July 1999 through \r\nFebruary 2002 show treatment and diagnosis of depression NOS \r\nand personality disorder NOS.  \r\n\r\nA December 2000 VA inpatient record shows treatment after \r\ntransfer from a private hospital subsequent to a panic attack \r\nand suicidal ideation.  The diagnoses were depression NOS, \r\npersonality disorder NOS with mixed traits, and dysthymia. \r\n\r\nOn December 2000 psychosocial assessment the Veteran reported \r\na long history of depression stemming from being sexually \r\nabused as a child. \r\n\r\nOn January 2001 consultation the Veteran was anxious, \r\ndepressed, and had written letters to his family asking for \r\nforgiveness stating that he was thinking of cutting his \r\nwrists.  He was recently separated from his fourth wife and \r\nhad lost his house.  He reported a history of being sexually \r\nabused by an uncle when he was 6 years old.  A. S., M.D. \r\nnoted a history of depression NOS, difficult upbringing, \r\nunstable adult relationships, irritability and intermittent \r\nsuicidality.     \r\n\r\nAn August 2004 letter from J. R. of \"The Right Step\" notes \r\nthe Veteran's participation in a residential treatment \r\nprogram for alcohol dependency from July 1 to July 8, 1997, \r\nand indicates that records of such treatment were destroyed.    \r\n\r\nMarch 2005 treatment records from the Texas Department of \r\nCriminal Justice, show that physician's assistant W. H. noted \r\nthe Veteran had a history of depression, as well as PTSD from \r\nfalling in a helicopter and that he experienced recurrent \r\nnightmares of falling in a helicopter.  The report also notes \r\nthe Veteran stated his sleep was poor, appetite was good, and \r\nhis energy level was good.  The diagnosis was \"311 \r\n[depressive disorder not otherwise specified]  / 309 (PTSD \r\nTraits).\"  W. H. opined that the Veteran needed therapy to \r\naddress his traumatic experience.  \r\n\r\nAn August 2006 statement from the Veteran provides details \r\nregarding an alleged in-service stressor event involving the \r\nhelicopter.   \r\n\r\nIn December 2006 a Formal Finding was made that the Veteran \r\nhad provided insufficient information to pursue stressor \r\nverification in connection with his PTSD claim.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) was Unit \r\nSupply Specialist.  He did not serve during a period of war, \r\nand is not shown to have engaged in combat.  Accordingly, to \r\nsubstantiate his PTSD claim there must be credible supporting \r\nevidence corroborating his alleged stressor event in service.  \r\nSee Cohen, 10 Vet. App. at 128.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran claims he has PTSD as the result of an emergency \r\nhelicopter landing in service in 1979.  He relates that a \r\nhazard light came on, and the landing was \"fast, hard, and \r\nvery scary\", and that his physical reactions at the time \r\nincluded vomiting and loss of bowel control.  He claims that \r\nsince then being in the proximity of a helicopter causes him \r\nto gag and lose his breath, and have daytime nightmares.  \r\n\r\nThe medical evidence of record shows a diagnosis of PTSD.  To \r\nsubstantiate his claim of service connection for such \r\ndisability, the Veteran must further show that the diagnosis \r\nis based on a stressor event in service that is corroborated \r\nby credible supporting evidence.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's alleged in-service stressor is unverified as he \r\nhas only provided non-specific information regarding the \r\nevent.  In August 2006 the RO requested further information \r\nfrom the Veteran to allow for stressor verification.  He \r\nresponded with some of the requested information; however, a \r\nlack of specificity in his provided responses coupled with a \r\nlack of responses to other requested information precluded \r\nverification efforts.  Without more specific information the \r\nRO was unable verify the alleged stressor.  See Formal \r\nFinding on a lack of information required to verify \r\nstressors.  As there is no credible supporting evidence of an \r\nin-service stressor, the record is insufficient to establish \r\nthat the Veteran has PTSD that is related to an in-service \r\nincident.  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that private treatment records from the Texas \r\nDepartment of Criminal Justice show a diagnosis of PTSD.  \r\nHowever, this diagnosis is based on the Veteran's unsupported \r\nhistory of having made an emergency landing in a helicopter.  \r\nA medical opinion premised upon an unsubstantiated account is \r\nof no probative value and does not serve to verify the \r\noccurrence described.  See Swann v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 229, \r\n233 (1993); Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395-96 (1996) \r\n(finding that an opinion by a mental health professional \r\nbased on a postservice examination of the Veteran cannot be \r\nused to establish the occurrence of a stressor).  Without \r\nevidence that the Veteran engaged in combat or credible \r\nsupporting evidence of an in-service stressor, even \r\nunequivocal medical evidence that a claimant has a diagnosis \r\nof PTSD is insufficient to establish that the PTSD is \r\nservice-related, so as to substantiate a claim of service \r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the record does not show that the Veteran engaged \r\nin combat with the enemy and there is no credible supporting \r\nevidence of an in-service stressor.  Thus a threshold \r\nrequirement for establishing service connection for PTSD is \r\nnot met.\r\n\r\nRegarding the various other psychiatric diagnoses diagnosed \r\npostservice (depressive disorder NOS, adjustment disorder \r\nwith anxiety and depression, personality disorder NOS with \r\nmixed traits, and dysthymia), none was manifested in service, \r\nand a psychosis was not manifested in the first postservice \r\nyear (so as to trigger application of the chronic disease \r\nprovisions in 38 U.S.C.A. � 1112; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.307, 3.309 \r\nfor), so as to warrant service connection on the basis that \r\nthe disability became manifest in service and persisted, or \r\non a presumptive basis (for psychosis).  Notably, a \r\npersonality disorder (of itself, without superimposed \r\npathology) is not considered a disease or injury under \r\nregulations governing compensation benefits.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.303(c).  Additionally, there is no competent (medical) \r\nevidence of a possible nexus between any of the Veteran's \r\npsychiatric diagnoses other than PTSD and his service.  \r\nPostservice treatment records note the various other \r\ndiagnoses and describe treatment, but do not relate any of \r\nthe diagnoses to service. \r\n\r\nIn light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the \r\npreponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's  claim \r\nfor service connection for a variously diagnosed psychiatric \r\ndisability (to include PTSD).  Consequently, the benefit of \r\nthe doubt doctrine does not apply; the claim must be denied. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a variously diagnosed psychiatric \r\ndisorder, to include PTSD, is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nGeorge R.

Slomich, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from September 1967 to May \r\n1969.\r\n\r\nThis matter came to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on \r\nappeal from an April 2004 rating decision of the Department \r\nof Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. \r\nPetersburg, Florida.\r\n\r\nA hearing at the RO was held in November 2007 before the \r\nundersigned Veterans Law Judge who was designated by the \r\nChairman to conduct the hearing pursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n7107(c) (West 2002) and who is rendering the determination in \r\nthis case.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn March 2008 the Board remanded the case ordering the \r\nverification of the Veteran's alleged PTSD stressor, and the \r\nconduction of a medical examination, if such stressor was \r\nverified by the Joint Services Records Research Center \r\n(JSRRC).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has contended that he developed PTSD as the \r\nresult of his experiences in Korea.  Specifically, he \r\ncontends that he developed PTSD as a result of a noncombat \r\nincident which occurred during the Fall of 1968, \r\napproximately between September and November 1968, when he \r\nwas stationed with the 226th Signal Company in Korea and \r\nworked as a radio teletype operator.  During the November \r\n2007 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that while he was \r\non a mission with his unit near the Sea of Japan, he was \r\nsitting on the beach with some fellow soldiers when they \r\nobserved lights on the horizon.  (The Veteran explained that \r\nthis period was a time of heightened tensions in Korea, as it \r\nwas several months after the capture of the U.S.S. Pueblo by \r\nthe North Koreans).  In light of this atmosphere, the \r\nVeteran's Lieutenant became alarmed and contacted their base \r\ncamp to report the suspicious lights on the sea.  The base \r\ncamp responded that there were no planned exercises by the \r\nU.S. Navy and that they should \"dig in, get under trucks, dig \r\nholes, and ammunition was passed out.\" See Hearing Transcript \r\nat page 6.  The Veteran indicated that the base camp sent \r\ncombat helicopters to investigate the source of the lights on \r\nthe sea.  The Veteran indicated that it appeared as if there \r\nwere 100 ships in the Sea of Japan and that he was certain he \r\nwas going to die.  The helicopter pilots, however, eventually \r\nradioed back that the lights in the sea were from fishing \r\nboats and that there was no threat.  Nonetheless, the Veteran \r\nindicated that he had been fearful for his life and had had \r\nrepeated nightmares of the incident for the past 30 years. \r\n\r\nFollowing the Board's March 2008 remand, the AMC submitted a \r\nrequest in April 2008 to the JSRRC in an attempt to verify \r\nthe Veteran's stressor.  The AMC submitted the approximate \r\ndates the incident was alleged to have occurred (September 1, \r\n1968 through November 30, 1968) and requested that the JSRRC \r\nverify the \"stressing experience.\"  Specifically, the AMC \r\nrequested the JSRRC verify that the Veteran's unit was placed \r\non a heightened alert over witnessing one hundred ships on \r\nthe beach the Veteran's unit was assigned to.  The AMC also \r\nreferenced the capture of the USS Pueblo by the North \r\nKoreans, and that there were unknown casualties as a result \r\nof the incident.  \r\n\r\nIn May 2008 the JSRRC responded that after having reviewed \r\nthe history of the 226th Signal Company for 1968, no reports \r\nof casualties were mentioned in the unit's history.  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds the AMC's request to JSRRC inadequate.  The \r\nAMC stated that the Veteran's stressors included capture of \r\nthe USS Pueblo; they do not.  The AMC then stated that the \r\nVeteran reported being on heightened alert after witnessing \r\n100 ships; the Veteran stated that it seemed from the lights \r\nas if there were 100 ships, not that there actually were.  \r\n\r\nThen, the Board also finds the May 2008 JSRRC response \r\ninadequate as it only addressed whether the Veteran's unit \r\nsuffered casualties in 1968.  As the Veteran has not \r\ncontended that any casualties occurred during this alleged \r\nstressful experience, this information is not helpful in \r\ndetermining whether the incident occurred.  No references \r\nwere made either to the incident that the Veteran described \r\nor to whether the 226th Signal Company was placed on a period \r\nof heightened alert during the September 1, 1968 through \r\nNovember 30, 1968 time period.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, another remand is required to attempt to \r\nverify the Veteran's stressor.  The AMC's compliance with the \r\nBoard's remand instructions is neither optional nor \r\ndiscretionary.  Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  The AMC should submit another request \r\nto the JSRRC requesting it verify whether \r\nthe Veteran's unit, the 226th Signal \r\nCompany stationed in the Republic of \r\nKorea, at some time between September 1, \r\n1968 through November 30, 1968, was \r\nplaced on heightened alert as a result of \r\na possible sighting of a large number of \r\nenemy ships offshore.\r\n\r\n2.  If and only if the attempt to obtain \r\nevidence corroborating the Veteran's \r\nclaimed stressor proves successful, the \r\nVeteran should be afforded a VA \r\npsychiatric examination for the purposes \r\nof determining whether a current \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD is appropriate, and, if \r\nso, whether that diagnosis may be \r\netiologically related to the corroborated \r\nstressor.  The claims file must be made \r\navailable to the examiner in connection \r\nwith the examination.  The examiner \r\nshould be requested to provide an opinion \r\nas to whether it is at least as likely as \r\nnot that the Veteran has PTSD as a result \r\nof the corroborated in-service stressor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. After the development requested above \r\nhas been completed, the AMC should review \r\nthe claim, considering all the evidence \r\nof record.  If the benefit sought on \r\nappeal is not granted, the Veteran and \r\nhis representative should be issued a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case, and \r\nbe afforded the appropriate period of \r\ntime to respond.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the case should be returned to the Board, if in \r\norder.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2009).\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nMICHELLE L.

Service in the Republic of \r\nVietnam is indicated by the evidence of record.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from an August 2007 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nCleveland, Ohio, which denied the Veteran's claim of \r\nentitlement to service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nProcedural history\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's claim of entitlement to PTSD was denied in an \r\nAugust 2007 RO rating decision.  In September 2007, the \r\nVeteran expressed disagreement with that decision and \r\nrequested review by a decision review officer (DRO).  A DRO \r\nconducted a de novo review of the claim and rendered a \r\ndecision in a February 2008 statement of the case (SOC) which \r\nwas unfavorable to the claim.  The Veteran perfected his \r\nappeal in March 2008 with the timely submission of a VA Form \r\n9.  \r\n\r\nIn December 2009, the Veteran presented sworn testimony \r\nbefore the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) via \r\nvideoconferencing equipment.  A transcript of the hearing has \r\nbeen associated with the Veteran's VA claims folder.\r\n\r\nClarification of issue\r\n\r\nThe Board observes that the Veteran has been diagnosed with \r\nmajor depressive disorder in addition to PTSD.  See a VA \r\ntreatment record dated December 2007.  \r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \r\n(Court) has recently determined that when a claimant makes a \r\nclaim of entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric \r\ndisability, (s)he is seeking service connection any acquired \r\npsychiatric disability regardless of how those symptoms are \r\nlabeled.  \r\nSee Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  The Board is \r\ntherefore redenominating the issue on appeal as entitlement \r\nto service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include \r\nPTSD, as instructed by the Court in Clemons.\r\n\r\nIssues not currently on appeal\r\n\r\nThe August 2007 rating decision also denied the Veteran \r\nentitlement to service connection for hepatitis C and \r\nrheumatoid arthritis.  As evidenced by the claims folder, the \r\nVeteran did not express disagreement with any of these \r\nactions.  Accordingly, those issues are not in appellate \r\nstatus and will be discussed no further herein.  See Archbold \r\nv. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 124, 130 (1996) [pursuant to 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 7105(a), the filing of a notice of disagreement \r\ninitiates appellate review in the VA administrative \r\nadjudication process, and the request for appellate review is \r\ncompleted by the claimant's filing of a substantive appeal \r\nafter a statement of the case is issued by VA].\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the Veteran \r\nif further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he has PTSD due to combat-related \r\nexperiences he endured while serving in the Republic of \r\nVietnam as an infantry indirect fire crewman.  The Board \r\ndetermines that a remand is necessary for further development \r\nwith regard to the Veteran's claimed in-service stressors.\r\n\r\nOfficial records indicate that the Veteran was assigned to \r\nthe Second Battalion with the Ninth Infantry Division in \r\nVietnam from December 1967 to October 1968.  Moreover, the \r\nVeteran's official records indicate service in the Vietnam \r\nCounteroffensive Phase III as well as the Tet \r\nCounteroffensive.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified that shortly upon arrival in Vietnam in \r\nearly to mid-December 1967, while on perimeter guard duty at \r\nhis base camp, he was subjected to enemy fire, and his base \r\ncamp was overrun.  See the December 2009 Board hearing \r\ntranscript, pgs. 6-7, 26-27.  The Veteran additionally \r\ntestified that when he experienced enemy fire, he witnessed a \r\nsoldier standing next to him who was killed, and watched \r\npeople commit suicide.  Id. at pgs. 8-9.  He reported that he \r\nwas \"constantly\" under fire during this period.  Id. at \r\npage 6.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, the Veteran testified that while on perimeter guard \r\nduty at the Tet Thu base camp in Vietnam, he encountered \r\nenemy fire and witnessed a soldier who was wounded.  Id. at \r\npage 22.  However, the Veteran did not provide a time frame \r\nas to when this event occurred.    \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's claimed stressors have not been submitted to \r\nthe United States Army and Joint Services Records Research \r\nCenter (JSRRC) [formerly the United States Armed Service \r\nCenter for Unit Records Research (CURR)] by the RO.  Because \r\nthe Veteran has provided sufficient details about the alleged \r\nstressor with respect to his base camp being overrun upon \r\narrival in Vietnam, in particular his unit assignment and \r\napproximate date of the incident, the Board finds that a \r\nremand is necessary in order to attempt verification of the \r\nreported stressor.  Further, if a stressor claimed by the \r\nVeteran is verified, a VA examination should be scheduled in \r\norder to ascertain whether the Veteran's claimed PTSD is a \r\nresult of a verified in-service stressor.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.\tVBA should contact the Veteran and ask \r\nthat he clarify when and where each of \r\nhis stressors occurred, especially the \r\nstressors identified in the December \r\n2009 Board Hearing.  The Veteran should \r\nalso be asked to provide any additional \r\ncorroborating evidence he may have \r\npertaining to the alleged stressors \r\nexperienced during his military \r\nservice.  The RO should also request \r\nthat the Veteran identify any recent \r\nmedical examination and treatment \r\nrecords pertaining to his claimed \r\npsychiatric disabilities.  VBA should \r\ntake appropriate steps to secure any \r\nrecords so identified and to associate \r\nthem with the Veteran's VA claims \r\nfolder.\r\n\r\n2.\tVBA should then review the file and \r\nprepare a summary of the Veteran's \r\nclaimed stressors, including his \r\nassertion that his unit received enemy \r\nfire within one month of his arrival in \r\nVietnam.  This summary, together with a \r\ncopy of the Veteran's DD Form 214 and \r\nany other documents VBA deems to be \r\nrelevant, should be sent to the U.S. \r\nArmy & Joint Services Records Research \r\nCenter (JSRRC).  That agency should be \r\nasked to provide any information that \r\nmight corroborate the Veteran's alleged \r\nstressors.\r\n\r\n3.\tIf and only if, at least one claimed \r\nin-service stressor is verified, the RO \r\nshould then make arrangements for the \r\nVeteran to be examined by an \r\nappropriate specialist for the purpose \r\nof addressing the existence and \r\netiology of the Veteran's claimed \r\npsychiatric disabilities.  The \r\nVeteran's VA claims folder must be made \r\navailable to the examiner.  The \r\nexaminer should either diagnose PTSD or \r\nrule it out as a diagnosis.  If the \r\nexaminer determines that the Veteran \r\nhas PTSD, he/she should state whether \r\nit is at least as likely as not (e.g., \r\na 50/50 probability) that the Veteran's \r\nPTSD is a result of his claimed in-\r\nservice stressors.  The VA examiner \r\nshould also determine whether the \r\nVeteran suffers from any other \r\npsychiatric disorders and if so whether \r\nthey are related to his military \r\nservice.  The report of the examination \r\nshould be associated with the Veteran's \r\nVA claims folder.\r\n\r\n4.\tAfter undertaking any additional \r\ndevelopment which it deems to be \r\nnecessary, the RO should then \r\nreadjudicate the Veteran's claim.  If \r\nthe benefit sought on appeal remains \r\ndenied, the Veteran and his \r\nrepresentative should be provided a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case \r\n(SSOC) and given an appropriate \r\nopportunity to respond.  Thereafter, \r\nthe case should be returned to the \r\nBoard for further consideration, if \r\notherwise in order.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nSee Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.

Kennerly, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant served on active duty in the United States Air \r\nForce from February 1949 to October 1970.  The appellant had \r\nservice in the Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) from April 1966 \r\nto April 1967.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from an October 2006 rating decision of the \r\nSeattle, Washington, Regional Office (RO) of the Department \r\nof Veterans Affairs (VA), which granted the appellant's \r\nclaims of entitlement to service connection for: (1) diabetes \r\nmellitus, Type II [assigning a 20 percent disability \r\nevaluation]; (2) ischemic heart disease [assigning a 30 \r\npercent disability evaluation]; (3) right lower extremity \r\nneuropathy [assigning a 10 percent disability evaluation]; \r\n(4) left lower extremity neuropathy [assigning a 10 percent \r\ndisability evaluation]; (5) hypertension [assigning a 10 \r\npercent disability evaluation]; and (6) low back strain \r\n[assigning a 10 percent disability evaluation].  The October \r\n2006 rating decision also denied entitlement to service \r\nconnection for: (7) a prostate disorder; (8) sleep apnea; (9) \r\nPTSD; and (10) Special Monthly Compensation for loss of use \r\nof a creative organ.\r\n\r\nIn November 2006, the appellant submitted a Notice of \r\nDisagreement (NOD) with the denial of his claim of \r\nentitlement to service connection for PTSD.

See \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 7107(a)(2) (West 2002).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The appellant has a current diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\n2.  The appellant did not engage in combat with the enemy.\r\n\r\n3.  There is no credible, verifying evidence of the \r\nappellant's stressors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPosttraumatic stress disorder was not incurred in or \r\naggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, \r\n1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2009); 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.303, 3.304 (2009).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Board has thoroughly reviewed all the evidence in the \r\nappellant's claims file.  Although the Board has an \r\nobligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this \r\ndecision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, the \r\nevidence submitted by the appellant or on his behalf.  See \r\nGonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) \r\n(the Board must review the entire record, but does not have \r\nto discuss each piece of evidence).  The analysis below \r\nfocuses on the most salient and relevant evidence and on what \r\nthis evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claim.  The \r\nappellant must not assume that the Board has overlooked \r\npieces of evidence that are not explicitly discussed herein.  \r\nSee Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (the law \r\nrequires only that the Board address its reasons for \r\nrejecting evidence favorable to the appellant).  \r\n\r\nThe Board must assess the credibility and weight of all \r\nevidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its \r\nprobative value, accounting for evidence which it finds to be \r\npersuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for \r\nrejecting any evidence favorable to the appellant.  Equal \r\nweight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in \r\nthe record; every item of evidence does not have the same \r\nprobative value.  When all the evidence is assembled, VA is \r\nresponsible for determining whether the evidence supports the \r\nclaim or is in relative equipoise, with the appellant \r\nprevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against a claim, in which case, the claim is \r\ndenied.  See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\nI.  The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the appellant's claim decided herein, VA has \r\nmet all statutory and regulatory notice and duty to assist \r\nprovisions.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, \r\n5106, 5107, 5126 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), \r\n3.159, 3.326 (2009).\r\n\r\nUnder the VCAA, when VA receives a complete or substantially \r\ncomplete application for benefits, it is required to notify \r\nthe claimant and his representative, if any, of any \r\ninformation and medical or lay evidence that is necessary to \r\nsubstantiate the claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) (West \r\n2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) (2009); Quartuccio v. Principi, \r\n16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  In Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. \r\nApp. 112, 120-21 (2004) (Pelegrini II), the United States \r\nCourt of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court) held that VA \r\nmust inform the claimant of any information and evidence not \r\nof record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; \r\n(2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant \r\nis expected to provide.  \r\n\r\nPrior to initial adjudication of the appellant's claim, a \r\nletter dated in February 2006 fully satisfied the duty to \r\nnotify provisions.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) (West 2002); 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1) (2009); Quartuccio, at 187.  The Board \r\nnotes that 38 C.F.R. � 3.159 was recently revised, effective \r\nas of May 30, 2008, and several portions of the revisions are \r\npertinent to the claim at issue.  See 73 Fed. Reg. 23, 353-\r\n23, 356 (April 30, 2008).  Notably, the final rule removes \r\nthe third sentence of 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1), which had \r\nstated that VA will request the claimant to provide any \r\nevidence in the claimant's possession that pertains to the \r\nclaim.  Despite this change in the regulation, the February \r\n2006 notice letter informed the appellant that it was \r\nultimately his responsibility to give VA any evidence \r\npertaining to the claim and to provide any relevant evidence \r\nin his possession.  See Pelegrini II, at 120-21.\r\n\r\nA notice letter dated in April 2006 informed the appellant of \r\nhow VA determines the appropriate disability rating or \r\neffective date to be assigned when a claim is granted, \r\nconsistent with the holding in Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson.  \r\nSee Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).\r\n\r\nAll the law requires is that the duty to notify is satisfied \r\nand that claimants are given the opportunity to submit \r\ninformation and evidence in support of their claims.  Once \r\nthis has been accomplished, all due process concerns have \r\nbeen satisfied.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384 \r\n(1993); Sutton v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 553 (1996); see also 38 \r\nC.F.R. � 20.1102 (2009) (harmless error).  In view of the \r\nforegoing, the Board finds that the appellant was notified \r\nand aware of the evidence needed to substantiate his claim, \r\nas well as the avenues through which he might obtain such \r\nevidence, and of the allocation of responsibilities between \r\nhimself and VA in obtaining such evidence.  Accordingly, \r\nthere is no further duty to notify.\r\n\r\nThe Board also concludes VA's duty to assist has been \r\nsatisfied.  The appellant's service treatment records and VA \r\nmedical records are in the file.  The appellant has at no \r\ntime referenced outstanding records that he wanted VA to \r\nobtain or that he felt were relevant to the claim.  However, \r\nas the appellant's claim fails for lack of verification of an \r\nin-service stressor, his current medical state is not in \r\nquestion.  As the VA medical records cannot provide \r\nverification of an in-service event, there is no prejudice in \r\nproceeding.  \r\n\r\nRegardless of the RO's February 2006, July 2009 and October \r\n2009 letters to the appellant asking for specificity \r\nregarding his alleged in-service stressors, the appellant has \r\nfailed to respond.  The appellant has not provided any \r\ninformation, particularly events and dates, specific enough \r\nto allow for verification of his alleged stressors.  The duty \r\nto assist is not always a one-way street.  If the appellant \r\nwants help, he cannot passively wait for it in those \r\ncircumstances where he may or should have information that is \r\nessential in obtaining the putative evidence.  See Wood v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).  The Board finds that \r\nthe duty to assist is satisfied on this point. \r\n\r\nThe duty to assist also includes providing a medical \r\nexamination or obtaining a medical opinion when such is \r\nnecessary to make a decision on the claim, as defined by law.  \r\nThe Board concludes an examination is not needed in this case \r\nbecause the only evidence indicating the appellant \"suffered \r\nan event, injury or disease in service\" consists of his own \r\nlay statements.  Such evidence is insufficient to trigger \r\nVA's duty to provide an examination.  The Court has held, in \r\ncircumstances similar to this, where the supporting evidence \r\nof record consists only of a lay statement, that VA is not \r\nobligated, pursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(d), to provide an \r\nappellant with a medical nexus opinion.  See Duenas v. \r\nPrincipi, 18 Vet. App. 512, 519 (2004) (finding no \r\nprejudicial error in Board's statement of reasons or bases \r\nregarding why a medical opinion was not warranted because \r\nthere was no reasonable possibility that such an opinion \r\ncould substantiate the veteran's claim because there was no \r\nevidence, other than his own lay assertion, that \" \r\n'reflect[ed] that he suffered an event, injury[,] or disease \r\nin service' that may be associated with [his] symptoms\").  \r\nSee also Paralyzed Veterans of America v. Secretary of \r\nVeterans Affairs, 345 F.3d 1334, 1355-57 (Fed. Cir. 2003) \r\n(holding that 3.159(c)(4)(i) is not in conflict with \r\n� 5103A(d) and evidence of record \"establishing that the \r\nveteran suffered an event, injury, or disease in service,\" is \r\nrequired to trigger VA's duties pursuant to � 5103A(d)); \r\nWells v. Principi, 326 F.3d 1381, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003) \r\n(holding that the Secretary's obligations under � 5103A to \r\nprovide a veteran with a medical examination or to obtain a \r\nmedical opinion is triggered if the evidence of record \r\ndemonstrates \"some casual connection between his disability \r\nand his military service\").  There is no reasonable \r\npossibility that a medical opinion would aid in \r\nsubstantiating the appellant's claim since it could not \r\nprovide evidence of a past event.\r\n\r\nAs there is no indication that any failure on the part of VA \r\nto provide additional notice or assistance reasonably affects \r\nthe outcome of this case, the Board finds that any such \r\nfailure is harmless.  See Mayfield v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. \r\n103 (2005), rev'd on other grounds, Mayfield v. Nicholson, \r\n444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Accordingly, the Board will \r\nproceed to a decision on this matter.\r\n\r\nII.  The Merits of the Claim\r\n\r\nThe appellant alleges that he currently suffers from PTSD \r\nthat is the result of his time in active military service.  \r\n\r\nRelevant Law and Regulations\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for a disability \r\nresulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by \r\nactive service.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 1110, 1131 (West 2002).  \r\nFor the showing of chronic disease in service there is \r\nrequired a combination of manifestations sufficient to \r\nidentify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to \r\nestablish chronicity at the time.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b) \r\n(2009).  If chronicity in service is not established, a \r\nshowing of continuity of symptoms after discharge is required \r\nto support the claim.  Id.  Service connection may be granted \r\nfor any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the \r\nevidence establishes that the disease was incurred in \r\nservice.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d) (2009).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\nestablishing a diagnosis of the condition, credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor \r\nactually occurred, and a link, established by medical \r\nevidence, between the current symptomatology and the claimed \r\nin-service stressor.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2009).\r\n\r\nIf the claimed stressor is related to combat, service \r\ndepartment evidence that a veteran engaged in combat or that \r\na veteran was awarded the Purple Heart Medal, Combat \r\nInfantryman Badge, or similar combat citation will be \r\naccepted, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as \r\nconclusive evidence of the claimed in-service stressor.  \r\n\"Credible supporting evidence\" of a non-combat stressor may \r\nbe obtained from service records or other sources.  See \r\nMoreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389 (1996).  However, the \r\nregulatory requirement for \"credible supporting evidence\" \r\nmeans that \"the appellant's testimony, by itself, cannot, as \r\na matter of law, establish the occurrence of a non-combat \r\nstressor.\"  See Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163 (1996). \r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nThe appellant has numerous diagnoses of PTSD.  The disorder \r\nhas been by some, attributed to the appellant's service in \r\nVietnam.  However, \"[j]ust because a physician or other \r\nhealth professional accepted appellant's description of his \r\nVietnam experiences as credible and diagnosed appellant as \r\nsuffering from PTSD does not mean the [Board is] required to \r\ngrant service connection for PTSD.\"  See Wilson v. Derwinski, \r\n2 Vet. App. 614, 618 (1992).  A finding that the appellant \r\nengaged in combat with the enemy during active service, or \r\nindependent evidence which confirms his account of in-service \r\nstressors, is necessary to establish service connection for \r\nPTSD.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has alleged that he suffered from the following \r\nsix stressful incidents during his time in Vietnam, which are \r\nthe cause of his currently diagnosed PTSD.  (1) The appellant \r\nstated that shortly after arriving in Vietnam, he found a \r\nsuitcase on a bench at a bus stop.  He reported the \r\nsuspicious case to the Air Police, who later confirmed that \r\nit contained an improvised explosive device.  (2) In 1966, \r\nthe appellant reported entering the main gate at the Tan Son \r\nNhut Air Base, when a Viet Cong (VC) soldier began firing on \r\nthe Air Police stationed at the gate.  The appellant stated \r\nhe took cover and successfully shot the VC soldier in the \r\narm, saving the lives of the Air Police.  (3) Also in 1966, \r\nthe appellant was able to visit his brother, who was also \r\nstationed in Vietnam.  The appellant stated that he was \r\nfearful for his brother's safety the entire time he was in \r\nVietnam.  (4) In 1967, the appellant reported a VC soldier \r\nthrowing a grenade into a crowd of people waiting for a bus, \r\nwhere he was standing.  The appellant reported that everyone \r\nelse at the bus stop took cover, but that he was paralyzed \r\nwith fear.  Another person helped him to safety and the \r\ngrenade did not detonate.  (5)  Also in 1967, the appellant \r\nreported being fearful for his life when rioting took place \r\nin the streets.  He stated that he boarded up his door to \r\nprotect himself from the angry mob.  Finally, (6) the \r\nappellant stated that his office in Vietnam was only several \r\nbuildings away from the mortuary on base.  As a result, he \r\nsaw many body bags containing the remains of fallen soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has also testified that he was responsible for \r\n200 missiles in Wyoming, Colorado and Nebraska.  His duties \r\nincluded supervising approximately 100 people, whom he \r\ndispatched on a daily basis.  The appellant reported that \r\nthis responsibility was very stressful, as he was required to \r\ntake tests with psychologists and polygraph machines to \r\nmaintain his security clearance.  See Travel Board Hearing \r\nTranscript, March 12, 2010, pp. 3-6.\r\n\r\nThe Board is not required to accept a veteran's \r\nuncorroborated, nonspecific account of his active service \r\nexperiences.  See Swann v. Brown, 5 Vet.  App. 229, 233 \r\n(1993); Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 192 (1991).  A \r\ndetermination as to whether the appellant is a veteran of \r\ncombat is particularly significant in a PTSD claim because he \r\nis entitled to have his lay statements as to his alleged \r\nstressors accepted, without corroboration, if he engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy.  See Gaines v. West, 11 Vet. App. 353 \r\n(1998).  The Court has held that:\r\n\r\n\"[w]here it is determined, through \r\nrecognized military  citations or other \r\nsupportive evidence, that the veteran  \r\nwas engaged in combat with the enemy and \r\nthe claimed stressors are related to \r\nsuch combat, the veteran's lay testimony \r\nregarding claimed stressors must be \r\naccepted as conclusive as to their \r\nactual occurrence and no further \r\ndevelopment for corroborative evidence \r\nwill be required, provided that the \r\nveteran's testimony is found to be \r\n'satisfactory,' e.g., credible, and \r\n'consistent with the circumstances, \r\nconditions, or hardships of [combat] \r\nservice.'\"\r\n\r\nSee Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 (1993); see also 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d) (2009).  \r\nBefore this provision applies, the Board must make a specific \r\nfinding that the appellant was engaged in combat with the \r\nenemy.  See Zarycki, supra.\r\n\r\nVA's Office of General Counsel has defined the phrase \r\n\"engaged in combat with the enemy\" to mean that the \r\nappellant must have personally participated in a fight or \r\nencounter with a military foe or hostile unit or \r\ninstrumentality.  See VAOPGCPREC 12-99.  The fact that the \r\nappellant served in a \"combat area\" or \"combat zone\" does not \r\nmean that he himself engaged in combat with the enemy.  Id.  \r\nMore over, a general statement in the appellant's service \r\npersonnel records that he participated in a particular \r\noperation or campaign would not, in itself, establish that he \r\nengaged in combat with the enemy because the terms \r\n\"operation\" and \"campaign\" encompass both combat and non-\r\ncombat activities.  Id.  Whether or not a veteran \"engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy\" must be determined through recognized \r\nmilitary citations or other supportive evidence.  No single \r\nitem of evidence is determinative, and VA must assess the \r\ncredibility, probative value, and relative weight of each \r\nrelevant item of evidence.  Id.  The claimant's assertions \r\nthat he engaged in combat with the enemy are not ignored, but \r\nare evaluated along with the other evidence of record.  Id.  \r\nHowever, the claimant's assertions that he \"engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy\" are not sufficient, by themselves, to \r\nestablish this fact.\r\n\r\nThe record does not support a finding that the appellant was \r\nin combat.  Though the appellant was awarded the Vietnam \r\nService Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Air \r\nForce Commendation Medal, the Air Force Good Conduct Medal \r\nand the Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon, he is not the \r\nrecipient of an award or citation that indicates that he was \r\nin combat in Vietnam.  Review of the appellant's service \r\npersonnel records also does not indicate combat experience.  \r\nIn fact, the appellant's records indicate that he served as a \r\nmaintenance superintendent, specializing in records and \r\nreports support analysis during his time in service.  See \r\nService Personnel Records, generally; see also Department of \r\nDefense Form 214.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force Commendation Medal was awarded based on the \r\nappellant's meritorious service as non-commissioned officer \r\nin charge of the Analysis Branch of the 1964th Communication \r\nGroup in Tan Son Nhut Air Base, Vietnam.\r\n\r\nThe RO has, on several occasions, requested more detailed \r\ninformation about the appellant's aforementioned stressors.  \r\nSpecifically, the appellant was requested to provide the \r\ndates and locations of his alleged stressors within a three \r\nmonth time period, such that the RO could send his \r\ninformation to the United States Army and Joint Services \r\nRecords Research Center for verification.  See VA letters to \r\nappellant, July 30, 2009 & October 2, 2009.  The appellant \r\nhas not responded.  The Board is aware of the appellant's \r\nrepresentative's argument that \"something\" must have caused \r\nthe appellant to suffer from PTSD, but due to his condition, \r\nthe appellant was unable to provide the detailed specifics \r\nthat the RO requires to substantiate his claim.  See VA Form \r\n646, December 30, 2009.  Review of the appellant's claims \r\nfile reveals that the appellant has been diagnosed with \r\nmultiple domain cognitive impairment.  See VA Medical Center \r\nNeuropsychiatric Note, April 15, 2008.  Though the Board \r\ncertainly empathizes with the appellant's condition, \r\nadditional information is necessary to attempt to verify his \r\nstressors.  As a result, the Board is left with only the \r\nappellant's service personnel records, which record only that \r\nhe was a maintenance superintendent with no combat \r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe Board is cognizant of the case of Pentecost v. Principi, \r\n16 Vet. App. 124 (2002), wherein the Court reversed the \r\nBoard's denial of a claim for service connection for PTSD on \r\nthe basis of an unconfirmed in-service stressor.  However, in \r\nPentecost, the claimant submitted evidence that his unit was \r\nsubjected to rocket attacks.  The Court pointed out that \r\ncorroboration of every detail of a stressor under such \r\ncircumstances, such as the claimant's own personal \r\ninvolvement, is not necessary.  See also Suozzi v. Brown, 10 \r\nVet. App. 307 (1997).  The facts in this case are \r\ndistinguishable because there is no independent evidence that \r\nthe appellant engaged in combat.  VA has been unable to \r\nobtain additional information regarding the appellant's \r\nalleged stressors, as the appellant has never identified a \r\nparticular time period or situation as a stressor that could \r\nbe verified.\r\n\r\nThe only evidence of record that the appellant engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy is his own testimony.  The Board finds \r\nthat the appellant did not engage in combat with the enemy.  \r\nSee VAOPGCPREC 12-99.  Concordantly, the Board also finds \r\nthat the preponderance of the evidence is against \r\nverification of combat as the appellant's claimed stressor.\r\n\r\nSince the Board finds that the appellant did not engage in \r\ncombat with the enemy, there must be credible supporting \r\nevidence of record that an alleged stressor occurred in order \r\nto warrant service connection.  His lay testimony is \r\ninsufficient, standing alone, to establish service \r\nconnection.  See Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App 128, 147 (1997) \r\n(citing Moreau, 9 Vet. App. at 395).  As noted above however, \r\nthe appellant has failed to provide any specific information \r\nthat could qualify as a stressor.  As indicated above, the \r\nduty to assist is not always a one-way street.  If the \r\nappellant wants help, he cannot passively wait for it in \r\nthose circumstances where he may or should have information \r\nthat is essential in obtaining the putative evidence.  See \r\nWood, supra.\r\n\r\nIn short, the Board finds that the preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against verification of the appellant's \r\nstressors.  The law requires verification; therefore the \r\nclaim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD is \r\ndenied.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2009).  As the claim fails \r\nfor lack of a credible, verified stressor, further inquiry \r\ninto a nexus between the PTSD and the alleged stressors is \r\nmoot.\r\n\r\nAlthough the appellant is entitled to the benefit of the \r\ndoubt where the evidence is in approximate balance, the \r\nbenefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable where, as here, \r\nthe preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for \r\nservice connection for PTSD.  See Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53. \r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nJOAQUIN AGUAYO-PERELES\r\nVeterans Law Judge, Board of Veterans' Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Department of Veterans Affairs\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"5bec3ad98102470b4a1117ba","name":"1022006.txt","plainText":"Citation Nr: 1022006\t\r\nDecision Date: 06/14/10    Archive Date: 06/24/10\r\n\r\nDOCKET NO.  05-38 788\t)\tDATE\r\n\t)\r\n\t)\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Los \r\nAngeles, California\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for hypertension, to \r\ninclude as secondary to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nAppellant represented by:\tDisabled American Veterans\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nTimothy S. Hoseth, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from February 1969 to April \r\n1973.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a rating decision by a Regional Office \r\n(RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  This matter \r\nwas remanded by the Board in October 2008.  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that service connection for hypertension was \r\nfirst denied in a June 2003 rating decision.  The Board \r\nconstrues a November 2003 statement by the representative \r\nseeking service connection for hypertension to constitute a \r\nnotice of disagreement with the June 2003 rating action.  The \r\nrecord shows the Veteran timely filed a substantive appeal.  \r\nAccordingly, a new and material evidence analysis is not \r\nnecessary in this case.\r\n\r\nIn the May 2010 argument to the Board, the Veteran's \r\nrepresentative referenced medical literature; however, no \r\ndocuments accompanied the Appellant's Post-Remand Brief.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's claimed hypertension was not manifested during \r\nthe Veteran's active service or for many years thereafter, \r\nnor is hypertension otherwise related to such service; the \r\nVeteran's hypertension is not causally related to nor has it \r\nbeen aggravated by his service-connected PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's claimed hypertension was not incurred in or \r\naggravated by his active duty service, nor may it be presumed \r\nto be incurred in or aggravated by such service, nor is \r\nhypertension proximately due to or aggravated by the \r\nVeteran's service-connected PTSD.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107 \r\n(West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310 (2009).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000\r\n\r\nUnder the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), \r\ncodified at 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, \r\n5107, and 5126; see also 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), and \r\n3.326(a), VA has a duty to notify and assist claimants.\r\n\r\nI. Notice\r\n\r\nThe VCAA provides that VA has a duty to notify claimants of \r\nany information and evidence needed to substantiate and \r\ncomplete a claim, and of what part of that evidence is to be \r\nprovided by the claimant and what part VA will attempt to \r\nobtain for the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.159(b)(1); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183, 187 \r\n(2002).\r\n\r\nThe notice requirements apply to all five elements of a \r\nservice connection claim: (1) veteran status; (2) existence \r\nof a disability; (3) a connection between the veteran's \r\nservice and the disability; (4) degree of disability; and (5) \r\neffective date of the disability.  Dingess/Hartman v. \r\nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 484 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims' \r\ndecision in Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 119-20 \r\n(2004), held, in part, that a VCAA notice, as required by \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a), must be provided to a claimant before \r\nthe initial unfavorable agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) \r\ndecision on a claim for VA benefits.\r\n\r\nThe notice requirements may be satisfied if any errors in the \r\ntiming or content of such notice are not prejudicial to the \r\nclaimant.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 103 (2005), \r\nrev'd on other grounds, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006).\r\n\r\nThe RO provided the appellant pre-adjudication notice by \r\nletters dated in January 2003 and January 2004.  This \r\nnotification substantially complied with the requirements of \r\nQuartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002), identifying \r\nthe evidence necessary to substantiate a claim and the \r\nrelative duties of VA and the claimant to obtain evidence.  \r\nThe RO provided the appellant post-adjudication notice in \r\nNovember 2008.  The case was readjudicated in February 2010 \r\nvia supplemental statements of the case, which contained \r\ninformation regarding disability ratings and effective dates.  \r\nSee Prickett v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 370, 376 (2006).  \r\nSince the Board concludes below that the preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against entitlement to service connection, any \r\nquestions as to the timing of the notice regarding \r\nappropriate disability ratings and effective dates to be \r\nassigned are rendered moot.  See Dingess/Hartman v. \r\nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has received all essential notice, has had a \r\nmeaningful opportunity to participate in the development of \r\nhis claim, and is not prejudiced by any technical notice \r\ndeficiency along the way.  See Conway v. Principi, 353 F.3d \r\n1369 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  In any event, the Veteran has not \r\ndemonstrated any prejudice with regard to the content of the \r\nnotice.  See Shinseki v. Sanders, 129 S.Ct. 1696 (2009) \r\n(reversing prior case law imposing a presumption of prejudice \r\non any notice deficiency, and clarifying that the burden of \r\nshowing that an error is harmful, or prejudicial, normally \r\nfalls upon the party attacking the agency's determination).  \r\nSee also Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328, 1333-34 (Fed. \r\nCir. 2006).  \r\n\r\nII. Duty to Assist\r\n\r\nThe VCAA also provides that VA has a duty to assist claimants \r\nin obtaining evidence needed to substantiate a claim.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 5103A; 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c).  In this case, the \r\nVeteran's service treatment records, service personnel \r\nrecords, VA treatment records, and private treatment records \r\nare on file.  There is no indication of relevant, available \r\nrecords which would support the Veteran's claim.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5103A(c); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(1)-(3).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA examination in December 2008.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(4).  The \r\nexamination report is thorough and contains sufficient \r\ninformation to decide the issue on appeal.  Thus, the Board \r\nfinds that further examination is not necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds there was substantial compliance with its \r\nOctober 2008 remand instructions.  See D'Aries v. Peake, 22 \r\nVet. App. 97, 105 (2008) (holding that only substantial \r\ncompliance with the terms of the Board's engagement letter \r\nwould be required, not strict compliance); see also Dyment v. \r\nWest, 13 Vet. App. 141, 146-47 (1999) (holding that there was \r\nno Stegall violation when the examiner made the ultimate \r\ndetermination required by the Board's remand, because such \r\ndetermination 'more than substantially complied with the \r\nBoard's remand order').  In this regard, a VA medical \r\nexamination was administered in December 2008 and additional \r\nVCAA notice was provided in November 2008 (As already noted, \r\nthe notice did not comply with Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, \r\n19 Vet. App. 473 (2006); however, such omission was not \r\nprejudicial.).  Therefore, the Board will proceed to review \r\nand decide the claims based on the evidence that is of \r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Board concludes that VA's \r\nduties to the Veteran to notify and assist him have been \r\nfulfilled with respect to the issue on appeal and the \r\nappellant is not prejudiced by a decision on the claim at \r\nthis time. \r\n\r\nLaws and Regulations\r\n\r\nApplicable law provides that service connection will be \r\ngranted if it is shown that the Veteran suffers from \r\ndisability resulting from an injury suffered or disease \r\ncontracted in line of duty, or for aggravation of a \r\npreexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of \r\nduty, in the active military, naval, or air service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 1110; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  That an injury \r\noccurred in service alone is not enough; there must be \r\nchronic disability resulting from that injury.  If there is \r\nno showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, \r\nthen a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service \r\nis required to support a finding of chronicity.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.303(b).  Additionally, for Veteran's who have served 90 \r\ndays or more of active service during a war period or after \r\nDecember 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities, such as \r\nhypertension, are presumed to have been incurred in service \r\nif manifest to a compensable degree within one year of \r\ndischarge from service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.307, 3.309.\r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted for any disease \r\ndiagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including \r\nthat pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran asserts that he is entitled to service connection \r\nfor hypertension as a result of exposure to Agent Orange \r\nwhile serving in Vietnam.  VA law and regulations provide \r\nthat if a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during \r\nactive military, naval, or air service, certain diseases \r\nshall be service connected if the requirements of 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.307(a)(6) are met, even though there is no record of such \r\ndisease during service, provided further that the rebuttable \r\npresumption provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 3.307(d) are also \r\nsatisfied.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1116; 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(e).  A \r\nveteran who served in the Republic of Vietnam during the \r\nVietnam era shall be presumed to have been exposed during \r\nsuch service to an herbicide agent, unless there is \r\naffirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not \r\nexposed to any such agent during that service.  38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n1116(f); 38 C.F.R. � 3.307(a)(6)(iii).  \r\n\r\nIn the present case, the Veteran's service personnel records \r\nreflect that he served in the Republic of Vietnam from May \r\n1970 to July 1971.  Exposure to Agent Orange is therefore \r\npresumed.  However, presumptive service connection is not \r\nwarranted for hypertension as this type of disability is not \r\nincluded in the list of diseases found in 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.309(e) which qualifies for presumptive service \r\nconnection.  See also 38 U.S.C.A. � 1116(a); 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.307(a)(6).  The Board's inquiry, however, does not end \r\nhere.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal \r\nCircuit has held that when a veteran is found not to be \r\nentitled to a regulatory presumption of service connection \r\nfor a given disability the claim must nevertheless be \r\nreviewed to determine whether service connection can be \r\nestablished on a direct basis.  Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d \r\n1039, 1043-44 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  In other words, the Board \r\nmust not only determine whether the Veteran has a disability \r\nwhich is recognized by VA as being etiologically related to \r\nprior exposure to herbicide agents that were used in Vietnam, \r\nsee 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(e), but must also determine whether his \r\ncurrent disability is the result of active service under 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1110 and 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nFurther, service connection is warranted for a disability, \r\nwhich is proximately due to, or the result of a service-\r\nconnected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310.  The Court \r\nhas also held that service connection can be granted for a \r\ndisability that is aggravated by a service-connected \r\ndisability and that compensation can be paid for any \r\nadditional impairment resulting from the service-connected \r\ndisorder.  Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).  Although \r\n� 3.310 was amended effective in October 2006, those changes \r\nwere more restrictive, so the Board will only consider the \r\nformer version of the regulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFactual Background and Analysis\r\n\r\nThe issue before the Board involves a claim of entitlement to \r\nservice connection for hypertension, to include as secondary \r\nto service-connected PTSD.  Historically, service connection \r\nwas granted for PTSD in June 2003.\r\n\r\nDuring the Veteran's service entrance examination in February \r\n1969, he expressly denied pain or pressure in his chest, \r\npalpitation or pounding heart, and high blood pressure.  The \r\nexaminer evaluated the Veteran's heart (thrust, size, rhythm, \r\nand sounds) as clinically normal and his blood pressure \r\nreading while sitting was 136/80.  The examiner ultimately \r\nfound the Veteran qualified for enlistment.\r\n\r\nService treatment records show that the Veteran was seen on \r\nmultiple times for various other complaints, but there was no \r\nreference to hypertension or heart problems.  In September \r\n1970, the Veteran complained of chest pain; x-rays of the \r\nVeteran's chest were within normal limits.\r\n\r\nDuring the Veteran's military separation examination in April \r\n1973, the Veteran stated that he did not know whether he had \r\npain or pressure in his chest, palpitation or pounding heart, \r\nor high blood pressure.  The Veteran's blood pressure reading \r\nwhile sitting was 132/86.  The Veteran's heart (thrust, size, \r\nrhythm, and sounds) was clinically evaluated as normal.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's private treatment records document that the \r\nVeteran has been treated for and diagnosed with hypertension.  \r\nPrivate treatment records document that in November 1979 the \r\nVeteran's blood pressure reading was 150/100.  In February \r\n1987, the Veteran was assessed with hypertension, and a viral \r\netiology was noted; at this time, his blood pressure reading \r\nwas 130/100.  In April 1987, the Veteran was assessed with \r\nhypertension, and recommended to continue his medication, \r\ndecrease his weight, increase his exercise, and avoid \r\nalcohol.  The Veteran's private treatment records document \r\nthat he has received ongoing treatment for his hypertension \r\nsince 1987.\r\n\r\nDuring the Veteran's October 2001 VA Agent Orange History and \r\nPhysical, he reported having hypertension since 1990, and \r\nthat he also began treatment for hypertension in 1990.  The \r\nVeteran reported that his blood pressure usually ran about \r\n140/90; however, at this time, his blood pressure reading was \r\n171/111.  The Veteran reported that he was currently \r\nexperiencing a headache.  He also reported getting short of \r\nbreath when doing minimal strenuous activity, getting pedal \r\nedema any time of the day a couple times per month, and \r\ndenied knowledge of any heart problems.  In July 2004, the \r\nVeteran reported that his blood pressure was up, and that it \r\nusually goes up when he is nervous or upset with PTSD \r\nexacerbation.  The Veteran reported that he did not take his \r\nblood pressure medication that morning.  The Veteran's VA \r\ntreating physician offered a medical opinion in support of \r\nthe Veteran's claim in July 2004.  The opinion states that \r\nthe physician had treated the Veteran for quite some time, \r\nand that the Veteran suffered from hypertension and PTSD.  \r\nThe physician stated that the Veteran's high blood pressure \r\nis usually controlled with medication, however, his PTSD and \r\nthe panic and anxiety associated with it makes the high blood \r\npressure hard to control sometimes.\r\n\r\nIn December 2008, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in \r\nconnection with his claim.  The examiner noted that the \r\nclaims file was reviewed, and listed 1980 as the date of \r\nonset for the Veteran's hypertension.  The Veteran's private \r\ntreatment records documented that the Veteran takes \r\nmedication for his hypertension.  The Veteran's blood \r\npressure readings were 173/99, 172/100, and 168/96.  An \r\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) was normal and showed normal sinus \r\nrhythm.  The examiner determined that hypertensive heart \r\ndisease was not present.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran \r\nwith hypertension.  The examiner concluded that (1) it was \r\nnot likely that the Veteran's hypertension was causally \r\nrelated to his active duty service; (2) it was not likely \r\nthat the Veteran's hypertensin was caused by his service-\r\nconnected PTSD, to include associated panic and anxiety \r\ndisorders; and (3) it is at least as likely as not that the \r\nVeteran's hypertension can be aggravated at times by his \r\nservice-connected PTSD, to include associated panic and \r\nanxiety disorders; however, his hypertension has not been \r\npermanently aggravated by his PTSD and associated panic and \r\nanxiety disorders.  The examiner stated that there were \r\nseveral etiologies for the development of the Veteran's \r\nprimary hypertension, including: family history, age, and \r\nobesity.  The examiner further stated that PTSD was not \r\nconsidered as a primary or secondary cause of hypertension.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has submitted multiple statements which contend \r\nthat his hypertension is related to his service and his \r\nservice-connected PTSD.  In May 2010, the Appellant's Post-\r\nRemand Brief cited medical literature in support of the \r\nVeteran's claim, which was submitted by the Veteran's \r\nrepresentative.  The medical literature suggests a \r\nrelationship between psychosocial factors, such anger, \r\nanxiety, depression, hostility, type A behavior, and various \r\nmeasures of social support, and the occurrence or recurrence \r\nof cardiovascular disease (CVD).  The medical literature also \r\nsuggests a relationship between stress and coronary artery \r\ndisease (CAD).\r\n\r\nAlthough the Veteran attempts to link his current \r\nhypertension to his service and service-connected PTSD, \r\nhypertension is not, in the Board's opinion, the type of \r\nobservable disorder subject to lay opinion as to causation.  \r\nSee Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  \r\nMoreover, the record does not show, nor does the Veteran \r\ncontend, that he has specialized education, training, or \r\nexperience that would qualify him to provide an opinion on \r\nthis matter.  Accordingly, the Veteran's lay statements as to \r\netiology are entitled to no probative value.  See Bostain v. \r\nWest, 11 Vet. App. 124, 127 (1998), citing Espiritu v. \r\nDerwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 494 (1992).  See also Routen v. \r\nBrown, 10 Vet. App. 183, 186 (1997).\r\n\r\nTo the extent the Veteran intends to suggest that he has had \r\nhypertension since service, the Board finds his account to be \r\ninconsistent with the other evidence of record, including the \r\nnegative separation examination and the Veteran's December \r\n2002 claim in which he contends that he has had hypertension \r\nsince 1988.  In addition, private treatment records do not \r\ndocument continuous treatment for hypertension until 1987.  \r\nThe lack of post-service medical records documenting the \r\nVeteran's claimed hypertension until many years after leaving \r\nactive duty is probative to the issue of chronicity of the \r\ndisability.  See generally Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330 \r\n(Fed. Cir. 2000).\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that service connection on a direct basis is \r\nnot warranted for hypertension.  Service medical records are \r\nsilent for any complaints of, treatments for, or diagnosis of \r\nhypertension.  The Veteran's blood pressure was recorded as \r\n136/80 at his entrance examination in February 1969, and \r\n132/86 at his separation examination in April 1973.  No \r\nhypertension was diagnosed on these occasions, or at any \r\nother time during service, or for many years following \r\nservice.  The absence of pertinent complaint or diagnosis in \r\nthe service medical records, and the pertinently normal \r\nclinical findings during service and on the April 1973 \r\nseparation examination, strongly suggest that neither the \r\nVeteran nor trained medical professionals believed that he \r\nsuffered from chronic hypertension during service or at the \r\ntime of this separation from service.  In sum, there is no \r\ncompetent or credible evidence suggesting that the Veteran \r\nwas diagnosed with hypertension during service or within the \r\none year presumptive period following service, nor is there \r\nsupporting evidence to suggest any continuity of hypertension \r\nfrom service to show a nexus to service.  Therefore, service \r\nconnection for hypertension is not warranted on a direct \r\nbasis.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that service connection for hypertension as \r\nsecondary to PTSD is also not warranted.  Considering the \r\ntotality of the evidence, the Board is presented with an \r\nevidentiary record which persuasively weighs against service \r\nconnection for the Veteran's hypertension as secondary to \r\nPTSD.  The evidence against such a link includes the VA \r\nmedical opinion from the December 2008 examination.  The \r\nexaminer concluded that it was not likely that the Veteran's \r\nhypertension was causally related to his active duty service \r\nor PTSD (including associated panic and anxiety disorders), \r\nor that it had been permanently aggravated by his PTSD \r\n(including associated panic and anxiety disorders).\r\n\r\nThe evidence in favor of a link includes the Veteran's \r\nstatements and VA medical opinion from July 2004.  The July \r\n2004 medical opinion concluded that the Veteran's PTSD and \r\nthe panic and anxiety associated with it makes his high blood \r\npressure occasionally hard to control, although his high \r\nblood pressure is usually controlled with medication.  The \r\nBoard also finds that the July 2004 opinion does not \r\nsufficiently address whether the Veteran's hypertension is \r\naggravated by his PTSD.  In this regard, the Board notes that \r\nthe opinion stated that the Veteran's high blood pressure was \r\nusually controlled with medication, and that it is only hard \r\nto control occasionally due to his PTSD and associated \r\nsymptoms.  Therefore, the Board finds that this opinion \r\nreferences a possible transient but not a permanent increase \r\nof blood pressure.  The Board notes that a flare-up of \r\nsymptoms, in the absence of an increase in the underlying \r\nseverity, does not constitute aggravation of the disability.  \r\nHunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 296-97 (1991).\r\n\r\nThe Board acknowledges the Veteran's submittal of medical \r\nliterature in support of his claim.  In this regard, the \r\nBoard notes that the May 2010 Appellant's Post-Remand Brief \r\ncites medical literature which suggests a relationship \r\nbetween psychosocial factors and CVD and CAD; however, the \r\nmedical literature does not reference hypertension.  The \r\nBoard notes that generally, an attempt to establish a medical \r\nnexus between service and a disease or injury solely by \r\ngeneric information in a medical journal or treatise \"is too \r\ngeneral and inconclusive.\"  Sacks v. West, 11 Vet. App. 314, \r\n317 (1998).  In addition, the Board may not adopt the \r\nconclusions suggested by the Veteran through his citation of \r\ngeneral medical information, as the Board is not competent to \r\nengage in medical analysis applying such generalized \r\ninformation to the particulars of the Veteran's specific case \r\nand medical history.  See Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. \r\n171 (1991).  The Board finds that this information has \r\nminimal probative value because it does not specifically \r\naddress the Veteran's hypertension and its cause, nor does it \r\nprovide a link between his hypertension and PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe Board must resolve the decisive medical questions in this \r\ncase by relying upon the most probative competent medical \r\nfindings addressing the Veteran's specific case.  The Board \r\nhas the authority to discount the weight and probity of \r\nevidence in light of its inherent characteristics and its \r\nrelationship to other items of evidence.  Madden v. Gober, \r\n125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  In this case, the \r\nBoard finds that the most persuasive probative analysis of \r\nthe decisive medical questions at issue is the December 2008 \r\nVA medical opinion, which does not present a basis for \r\nfinding that the Veteran's hypertension is etiologically \r\nrelated to his active duty service or service-connected PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe Board sympathizes with the Veteran, recognizes his \r\nservice and understands fully his contentions.  Nevertheless, \r\nafter thorough review of the evidence currently of record, \r\nthe Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is \r\nagainst the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service \r\nconnection for hypertension, to include as secondary to PTSD.  \r\nConsequently, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, \r\nand service connection for hypertension, including as \r\nsecondary to PTSD, is not warranted.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); \r\nGilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nThe appeal is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nThomas H.

Marenna, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant had active service from July 1964 to July 1967.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from a February 2004 rating decision of the Department \r\nof Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Indianapolis, \r\nIndiana.\r\n\r\nThis case was previously before the Board in June 2008, when the \r\ncase was remanded for further development of the appellant's \r\nclaimed PTSD stressors.  As the development was completed, the \r\nBoard finds that the RO substantially complied with the mandates \r\nof the June 2008 remand and will proceed to adjudicate the \r\nappeal.  See Dyment v. West, 13 Vet. App. 141 (1999) (noting that \r\na remand is not required under Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 \r\n(1998) where the Board's remand instructions were substantially \r\ncomplied with), aff'd, Dyment v. Principi, 287 F.3d 1377 (2002). \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe evidence includes a diagnosis by a VA psychiatrist of PTSD \r\nbased upon a stressor related to the appellant's fear of hostile \r\nmilitary activity, and consistent with the places, types and \r\ncircumstances of his service.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was incurred in active service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5103A, \r\n5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304 (2009).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD has been \r\ngranted, as discussed below.  As such, the Board finds that any \r\nerror related to the VCAA on that claim is moot.  See 38 U.S.C. \r\n�� 5103, 5103A (West 2002 & Supp. 2008); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159 \r\n(2008); Mlechick v. Mansfield, 503 F.3d 1340 (2007).\r\n\r\nI. Applicable Criteria\r\n\r\nService connection is warranted if it is shown that a Veteran has \r\na disability resulting from an injury incurred or a disease \r\ncontracted in active service or for aggravation of a pre-existing \r\ninjury or disease in active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� \r\n1110, 1131 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (2009).  Service \r\nconnection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after \r\ndischarge when all of the evidence establishes that the disease \r\nwas incurred in service.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nEstablishing service connection generally requires medical or, in \r\ncertain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; \r\n(2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or \r\ninjury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in- service disease \r\nor injury and the present disability.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 \r\nF.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing \r\nthe condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a), credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually \r\noccurred, and a link, established by medical evidence, between \r\ncurrent symptomatology and an in-service stressor.  In general, \r\nthe Veteran's lay testimony, by itself, will not be enough to \r\nestablish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.  Instead, the \r\nrecord must contain evidence that corroborates the Veteran's \r\naccount as to the occurrence of the claimed stressor.  See 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d), (f); Cohen v. Brown, 10 \r\nVet. App. 128 (1997).\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, if the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that \r\ncombat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the \r\ncontrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent \r\nwith the circumstances, conditions or hardships of the Veteran's \r\nservice, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the \r\noccurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, during the course of this appeal, 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f) was amended to provide that if a stressor claimed by a \r\nVeteran is related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or \r\nterrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist or \r\ncontract equivalent confirms that the claimed stressor is \r\nadequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran's \r\nsymptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of \r\nclear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the \r\nclaimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and \r\ncircumstances of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay \r\ntestimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-\r\nservice stressor.  See 75 Fed. Reg. 39843 (2010).  As the \r\nappellant's claim was not decided by the Board prior to July 12, \r\n2010, the amended version of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) is applicable.  \r\nId.  \r\n\r\nII. Analysis\r\n\r\nThe appellant contends that he is entitled to service connection \r\nfor PTSD.  For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes that \r\nservice connection is warranted.\r\n\r\nThe appellant was seen for a PTSD Screening Evaluation in \r\nDecember 2004.  The evaluation was conducted by a VA \r\npsychiatrist, who tentatively diagnosed the appellant with PTSD.  \r\nVA treatment records from July through October 2006 indicate the \r\nappellant had treatment for PTSD.  A May 2007 VA treatment record \r\nnoted the appellant had a history of PTSD.  Although a September \r\n2007 VA treatment record reflected that a screen for PTSD was \r\nnegative, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \r\n(Court) has held that the presence of a chronic disability at any \r\ntime during the claim process can justify a grant of service \r\nconnection, even where the most recent diagnosis may be negative.  \r\nMcClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007).  Thus, as the \r\nappellant was diagnosed with PTSD during the rating period on \r\nappeal, he has a current PTSD disability for purposes of his \r\nclaim for entitlement to service connection.       \r\n\r\nThe appellant claims that he has PTSD as a result of his \r\nexperiences serving in Vietnam from May 1965 to May 1966.  In a \r\nPTSD questionnaire dated in September 2004, the appellant \r\nreported that he went on a patrol in a suspected Viet Cong \r\nvillage and nearly killed an old Vietnamese couple.  He also \r\nreported that while working at an airfield, he had to remove dead \r\nbodies from helicopters into trucks to be transported back to the \r\nbase.  In an April 2006 RO hearing, the appellant stated that he \r\nwas a security guard and his primary job in Vietnam was guarding \r\nthe compound.  In a January 2008 statement, the appellant stated \r\nthat the first few months he was in Vietnam, he had to go on \r\nreconnaissance patrols outside of the compound in order to \r\nachieve combat pay.  He stated that he experienced the fear that \r\nanyone would have, while fighting in a war zone.  He reported \r\nthat his fear was that at any moment, he could lose his life.  \r\n\r\nIn the December 2004 PTSD Evaluation report, the VA psychiatrist, \r\nfound that the appellant met criterion A for exposure to a PTSD \r\nstressor under the DSM-IV criteria because he was exposed to \r\ntrauma that involved times of fear, helplessness, and horror as \r\nhe described the uncertainty of being mortared and other \r\nexperiences.  He knew that at any time he could be killed or \r\ninjured or the compound overrun.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant's DD Form 214 indicates that his military \r\noccupational specialty (MOS) was light weapons infantryman.  The \r\nappellant's service personnel records reflect that the \r\nappellant's principal duty while he was assigned to Vietnam from \r\nMay 1965 to May 1966 was security guard.  The appellant's MOS and \r\nassigned principal duty in Vietnam indicate that his claimed \r\nstressor of fear of being killed or injured while on patrol or \r\ndue to mortar attacks was consistent with the places, types, and \r\ncircumstances of the appellant's service, his lay testimony alone \r\nmay establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nThe appellant reported a stressor of fear of being killed or \r\ninjured, indicating a fear of hostile military activity.  In \r\nDecember 2004, a VA psychiatrist found that the claimed stressor \r\nwas adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD.  As the appellant's \r\nstressor is consistent with his service as a light weapons \r\ninfantryman in Vietnam, the Board finds that the occurrence of an \r\nin-service PTSD stressor has been established.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nIn sum, the appellant has been diagnosed as having PTSD, which \r\nwas linked by a VA psychiatrist in December 2004 to a stressor of \r\nfear of death and injury during his service in Vietnam.  As the \r\nstressor is related to fear of hostile military activity and \r\nconsistent with the conditions of the appellant's service, the \r\noccurrence of the stressor has been established.  When all the \r\nevidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether \r\nthe evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with \r\nthe appellant prevailing in either event, or whether a \r\npreponderance of the evidence is against a claim, in which case, \r\nthe claim is denied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 \r\n(1990).  Resolving all doubt in the appellant's favor, the Board \r\nfinds that the evidence of record is sufficient to support a \r\nfinding of service connection for PTSD.  Accordingly, the \r\nappellant's claim for service connection for PTSD is granted.  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nU.R.

Macko, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nPlease note this appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket \r\npursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c) (2009).  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 7107(a)(2) (West 2002).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active service from July 1956 to October 1957.\r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on \r\nappeal from rating decisions of the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Atlanta, Georgia, and \r\nCleveland, Ohio.  \r\n\r\nIn consideration of a recent Court decision, the Board has \r\nrecharacterized the Veteran's psychiatric claims, as is now \r\nstated on the title page.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. \r\nApp. 1 (2009) (the scope of a mental health disability claim \r\nincludes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed \r\nby the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, \r\nand the other information of record).\r\n\r\nRegarding the issue for appellate review, by history, the Veteran \r\nsubmitted several claims in 2005, seeking service connection for \r\naggravated alcoholism, nervous conditions, arthritis, depression, \r\nand chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.  Ultimately, these \r\nclaims were denied in a June 2006 rating decision by the Atlanta, \r\nGeorgia, RO.  Within one year of the date that that rating \r\ndecision was mailed to the Veteran, the Veteran, who had \r\nrelocated to the jurisdiction of the Cleveland, Ohio, RO, \r\nsubmitted a June 2007 statement requesting to \"reopen\" his \r\nclaims for depression and PTSD.  The Cleveland RO denied this \r\nclaim in a November 2007 rating decision.  The Board considers \r\nthe June 2007 submission to been a timely appeal of the June 2006 \r\nrating decision with regard to the issues of depression and PTSD; \r\ntherefore there is no need to now consider the jurisdictional \r\nmatter of the submission of new and material evidence.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 20.302(a) (2009).\r\n\r\nThe the issue of entitlement to service connection for \r\nsinusitis has been raised by the record (April 2005 \r\nstatement), but has not been adjudicated by the Agency of \r\nOriginal Jurisdiction (AOJ).  Therefore, the Board does \r\nnot have jurisdiction over it, and it is referred to \r\nthe AOJ for appropriate action.  \r\n\r\nIn July 2009, the Veteran submitted a Statement in Support of his \r\nClaim to the RO, in which he requested that his case be advanced \r\non the Board's docket, due to failing health issues.  The Board \r\nallows the request to advance the case on the Board's docket at \r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nIn September 2009, the appellant presented testimony before the \r\nundersigned Acting Veterans Law Judge (AVLJ) at the RO.  A \r\ntranscript of that hearing was placed in the claims file and was \r\nconsidered in determining to remand this case.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if \r\nfurther action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nWhile the Board regrets the additional delay in resolving the \r\nVeteran's claims, more evidentiary development is required before \r\nthese claims may be adjudicated.  Among other stressors, the \r\nVeteran avers that PTSD is caused by the following stressor:  \r\n\"Evacuation of soldier from a burning air plane in a river.\"  \r\nVeteran's hand-written statement received in September 2005.  In \r\nanother hand-written statement addressed to his Doctor and the \r\nAtlanta RO, apparently received in April 2005, the Veteran stated \r\nthat while he was serving with the 618, 1st Medical Battalion as \r\na medical corpsman, a \"RR\" airplane was taking off going to \r\nJapan from Korea, when the airplane exploded.  It went down in \r\nthe \"Hum\" River or \"some other\" river.  A unit from the 618, \r\n1st Medical Battalion was sent to the crash site to help with the \r\nevacuation of the wounded soldiers.  The Veteran avers that he \r\nwas included in the evacuation of the wounded soldiers and the \r\nincident still deleteriously affects him today.  The airplane was \r\non fire, the water around the burning airplane was on fire, and \r\nsome of the soldiers were burning.  The Veteran testified about \r\nthe stressful nature of this incident and that the propeller of \r\nthe airplane had come off and flown back into the plane.  \r\nTranscript of Travel Board hearing at pp. 12, 14, 19.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has attempted to provide credible supporting evidence \r\nof this stressor with a buddy statement, which statement reports \r\na crash of a plane carrying U.S. troops headed for Japan in the \r\nspring of 1957, where in a propeller had come loose, tearing into \r\nthe plane, and the plane crashed into the Han River.  See buddy \r\nstatement by J.W.V., April 2005.  The Board has included in the \r\nclaims file the result of a computer-Internet search which found \r\ninformation describing a February 22, 1957, crash of a C-124 \r\nGlobemaster airplane which departed from a Seoul, Korea, air base \r\nbound for Japan and which crashed shortly after take-off onto the \r\nfrozen Han River.  The propeller reportedly came loose and sliced \r\nthrough the side of the fuselage.  U.S. service personnel were on \r\nboard.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records and personnel records \r\nwere destroyed in a fire at the National Personnel Records Center \r\nin 1973.  Under such circumstances, the Board recognizes that \r\nthere is a heightened obligation to assist the Veteran in the \r\ndevelopment of the case, a heightened obligation to explain \r\nfindings and conclusions, and a heightened duty to consider \r\ncarefully the benefit of the doubt rule.  See Washington v. \r\nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 369-70 (2005); Cromer v. Nicholson, \r\n19 Vet. App. 215, 217 (2005) (citing O'Hare v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. \r\nApp. 365, 367 (1991)); Cuevas v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 542, 548 \r\n(1992).\r\n\r\nWhile the Veteran's personal service records were destroyed by \r\nfire, it is expected that his unit's records might be able to \r\nprovide credible supporting evidence that a unit from the 618, \r\n1st Medical Battalion was sent to the rescue aid of the subject \r\nairplane crash.  Accordingly, the RO should undertake to obtain \r\ncredible supporting evidence of the alleged stressor via unit \r\nrecords as specified below.\r\n\r\nUpon a finding of credible supporting evidence of one or more of \r\nthe Veteran's alleged stressors, the Veteran should be afforded a \r\nVA PTSD examination to determine the nature of his acquired \r\npsychiatric disorder(s) and whether any PTSD diagnosed is based \r\nat least in part upon said stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) \r\n(2009).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the November 2007 rating decision and subsequent \r\nstatements of the case indicate that the Veteran's treatment \r\nrecords from the Cleveland, Ohio, VAMC, from 1994 to 2007 were \r\nviewed electronically.  These records to date have not been \r\nprinted and included in the record for the Board's review; \r\ntherefore, any such treatment records that pertain to the \r\nVeteran's acquired psychiatric disorder claim must be printed and \r\nincluded in the claims file for Board review.  \r\n\r\nAs well, a review of the Veteran's Atlanta VAMC records, which \r\nspan in the claims file from January to March 2006, indicate he \r\nwas scheduled for an April 2006 PTSD consultation/evaluation; yet \r\nthis consultation, if it occurred, has not been included in the \r\nrecord.  In his testimony, the Veteran indicated he has continued \r\nto receive PTSD treatment at the Brecksville, Ohio, VA outpatient \r\nclinic.  These records should also be obtained and included in \r\nthe record.\r\n\r\nFurther, in a January 2006 private Clinical and Psychosocial \r\nAssessment, the Veteran indicated he is in receipt of Social \r\nSecurity disability benefits.  If the Veteran is indeed receiving \r\nSocial Security disability benefits for an acquired psychiatric \r\ndisorder, then the determination and underlying medical evidence \r\nshould be obtained and included in the record.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.\tAppropriate action must be taken, such as \r\nthrough the Joint Services Records \r\nResearch Center (JSRRC) to attempt to \r\nobtain credible supporting evidence that a \r\nunit from the 618, 1st Medical Battalion \r\nwas sent to the aid of an airplane crash \r\ninto a river in 1957.  The period from \r\nFebruary 21, 1957, going forward through \r\nthe spring of 1957, should be searched if \r\npossible.  All efforts to obtain credible \r\nsupporting evidence of this stressor, and \r\nthe result of each effort, must be noted \r\nin the claims file.  \r\n\r\n2.\tObtain and include in the claims file to \r\nthe extent not already on file:\r\n\r\na.\t  the Veteran's VA treatment records from \r\nVAMC Cleveland from 1994 to present that \r\npertain to PTSD and depression, \r\n\r\nb.\tVA treatment records from VAMC Atlanta \r\nfrom 2002 to present that pertain to PTSD \r\nand depression, to include the record of \r\nany VA examination/consultation conducted \r\nfor mental disorders.\r\n\r\nc.\tany treatment records from the outpatient \r\nclinic in Brecksville, Ohio, from June \r\n2007 to present that also pertain to PTSD.  \r\n(Document any inability to locate any \r\nrecords or any inability to include these \r\nrecords in the claims file.)\r\n\r\n3.  Determine whether the Veteran is in \r\nreceipt of Social Security disability \r\nbenefits, and if so, contact the appropriate \r\noffice to obtain a copy of the determination \r\nnotice and the underlying medical evidence.  \r\nDocument for the claims file any negative \r\nreplies.\r\n\r\n4.  After the above listed items have been \r\naccomplished and upon a finding of credible \r\nsupporting evidence of at least one claimed \r\nstressor, schedule the Veteran for a VA \r\nmental health examination by an appropriate \r\nVA examiner.  All indicated tests and studies \r\n(to include psychological testing, as \r\nappropriate) should be accomplished, and all \r\nclinical findings should be reported in \r\ndetail.\r\n\r\na.  The claims folder must be provided to the \r\nexaminer for review and the examiner should \r\nindicate whether the claims file has been \r\nreviewed.  As part of the examination, the \r\nexaminer should discuss any links between \r\ncurrent symptomatology and the in-service \r\nstressor(s) for which credible supporting \r\nevidence has been adduced.\r\n\r\nb.  The examiner must express an opinion as \r\nto whether it is \"more likely than not\" \r\n(likelihood greater than 50%), \"at least as \r\nlikely as not\" (50%), or \"less likely than \r\nnot\" (less than 50% likelihood) that the \r\nVeteran has PTSD that is, at least in part, \r\nbased upon the specified in-service \r\nstressor(s).  A complete rationale should be \r\nprovided for any opinion or conclusion.\r\n\r\nc.  The term \"at least as likely as not\" does \r\nnot mean \"within the realm of medical \r\npossibility.\"  Rather, it means that the \r\nweight of medical evidence both for and \r\nagainst a conclusion is so evenly divided \r\nthat it is as medically sound to find in \r\nfavor of the conclusion (e.g., diagnosis, \r\netiology) as it is to find against the \r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nd.  The Veteran is hereby notified that it is \r\nhis responsibility to report for the \r\nexamination scheduled in connection with this \r\nREMAND and to cooperate in the development of \r\nhis case.  The consequences of failure to \r\nreport for a VA examination without good \r\ncause may include denial of his claim.  38 \r\nC.F.R. �� 3.158, 3.655 (2009).\r\n\r\n5.  After all of the above actions have been \r\ncompleted, readjudicate the Veteran's claim.  \r\nIf the claim remains denied, issue to the \r\nVeteran and his representative a supplemental \r\nstatement of the case, and afford the \r\nappropriate period of time within which to \r\nrespond thereto.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for \r\nVeterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate \r\naction must be handled in an expeditious manner.

The \r\nVeteran had a hearing before the Board in June 2010 and the \r\ntranscript is of record.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran provided additional VA outpatient treatment records \r\nthrough June 2010 at his June 2010 hearing before the Board.  A \r\nsupplemental statement of the case (SSOC) was not issued, but \r\nthis is not necessary since the evidence submitted was \r\naccompanied by a waiver of local jurisdictional review.\r\n \r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals \r\nManagement Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will \r\nnotify the Veteran if further action is required on his \r\npart.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran claims he suffers from PTSD as a result of a personal \r\nattack on him while stationed on the USS Cleveland.  \r\nSpecifically, he indicates an event where he was taken from his \r\nsleep, tied upside down, and beaten for several hours by fellow \r\nNavy men.  Since that time, the Veteran claims he suffers from \r\nnightmares and intrusive memories of the incident. \r\n\r\nIf a PTSD claim is based on personal assault in service, evidence \r\nfrom sources other than the Veteran's records may corroborate the \r\nVeteran's account of the stressor incident.  Examples of such \r\nevidence include, but are not limited to: records from law \r\nenforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental health \r\ncounseling centers, hospitals or physicians; pregnancy tests or \r\ntests for sexually transmitted diseases; and statements from \r\nfamily members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy.  38 \r\nC.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) (2009).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, evidence of behavior changes following the claimed \r\nassault is relevant evidence that may be found in the mentioned \r\nsources.  Examples of behavior changes that may constitute \r\ncredible evidence of a stressor include, but are not limited to: \r\na request for a transfer to another military duty assignment; \r\ndeterioration in work performance; substance abuse; episodes of \r\ndepression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable \r\ncause; or unexplained economic or social behavior changes.  Id.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, pertinent provisions of Manual M21-1 specifically \r\naddress the types of documentation that may be used to \r\ncorroborate the occurrence of a stressor where the alleged \r\nstressor event is physical or sexual assault.  See Cohen v. \r\nBrown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 139-143 (1997); M21-1MR Part III.iv.4.H; \r\nsee also YR v. West, 11 Vet. App. 393, 399 (1998).\r\n\r\nThe law is clear that VA will not deny a PTSD claim that is based \r\non in-service personal assault without first advising the \r\nclaimant that evidence from sources other than service records or \r\nevidence of behavior changes may constitute credible supporting \r\nevidence of the stressor, and allowing him/her the opportunity to \r\nfurnish this type of evidence or advise VA of potential sources \r\nof such evidence.  VA must make all reasonable efforts to obtain \r\nthe relevant evidence.  38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c) (2009).  As well, VA \r\nmay submit any evidence that it receives to an appropriate \r\nmedical or mental health professional for an opinion as to \r\nwhether it indicates that a personal assault occurred.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f)(3) (2009).  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was sent a duty-to-assist letter in December 2006, \r\nwhich included a stressor identification worksheet, but the \r\nletter did not detail the majority of the information cited \r\nabove.  Additionally, in July 2004, VA approved for publication a \r\nnew form, VA Form 21-0781a, Statement in Support of Claim for \r\nService Connection for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Secondary \r\nto Personal Trauma.  The new form identifies additional types of \r\ndocumentation that may be used to corroborate the occurrence of a \r\nstressor involving assault, and it lists additional behavior \r\nchanges or experiences that might occur following an assault.  \r\nThe Veteran was never sent this new form and, therefore, he \r\nshould be sent and asked to complete a new VA Form 21-0781a.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran indicates that during the attack his head was \r\ncovered, but he recognized one of the voices of the attackers.  \r\nHe states that he immediately reported the incident to his \r\ncaptain, who demoted the attacker, and the Veteran received \r\nmedical treatment for his lacerations and bruises.  Indeed, his \r\nservice treatment records confirm in September 1977 the Veteran \r\nsought treatment for chest pain, bruises on his lower half of \r\nback (both right and left sides), left thumb and index finger \r\nswelling, and other bruises.  At that time, the Veteran indicates \r\nhe was kicked in the chest while asleep in the rack.  The \r\nVeteran's personnel records also show that he received \r\ndisciplinary action for substance abuse and was ultimately \r\nadministratively discharged.  \r\n\r\nThere is no actual documentation in the claims folder of the \r\nclaimed incident, but the Board noted the RO should make a search \r\nof deck logs from September 1977 to ascertain whether the \r\nincident was documented. \r\n\r\nVA outpatient treatment records reflect a diagnosis of PTSD \r\nrelated to this personal assault incident, but the Veteran was \r\nafforded a VA examination in November 2007 where the examiner \r\nopined the Veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.  \r\nRather, the examiner noted the Veteran had a significant \r\nsubstance abuse problem that began prior to his military service.  \r\nThe examiner further noted that the Veteran had serious traumatic \r\nmuggings in 2003, well after service, where he was assaulted and \r\nheld at gun point.  The examiner opined that these events were \r\nmost likely responsible for the Veteran's reported symptoms.  The \r\nexaminer confirmed the opinion once again in March 2008 after \r\nreviewing the claims folder.\r\n\r\nIn light of the possible missing records and the VCAA notice \r\ndeficiencies, the Board finds further development is warranted.  \r\nIf the new evidence indeed provides new information with regard \r\nto the claimed personal assault, a new VA examination should be \r\nafforded to the Veteran to reconcile the conflicting medical \r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  In accordance with the provisions of M21-1MR \r\nPart III.iv.4.H., the RO should once again send \r\nthe Veteran an appropriate stressor development \r\nletter.  The Veteran should also be notified that \r\nin-service personal assault may be corroborated \r\nby evidence from sources other than the service \r\nrecords, as defined in 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) \r\n(2009).  All specific examples of alternative \r\nsources of evidence listed in section 3.304(f)(3) \r\nmust be included in the notification to the \r\nVeteran. \r\n\r\nThe RO should also send the Veteran a new VA Form \r\n21-0781a, Statement in Support of Claim for \r\nService Connection for Post Traumatic Stress \r\nDisorder Secondary to Personal Trauma, and \r\nrequest he complete it with as much specificity \r\nas possible.  The RO should inform the Veteran \r\nthat if he fails to return any form that would \r\nprovide details regarding the in-service stressor \r\nevent or fails to provide information useful to \r\nverifying this event, VA will have no choice but \r\nto proceed to decide the case based on the \r\nevidence of record.  An appropriate period of \r\ntime should be allowed for the Veteran to respond \r\nand/or submit additional evidence.  \r\n\r\n2.  Obtain the Veteran's medical records from the \r\nVA Medical Center in Dallas, Texas for treatment \r\nfrom June 2010 to the present.  All efforts to \r\nobtain VA records should be fully documented, and \r\nthe VA facility must provide a negative response \r\nif records are not available.\r\n\r\nIf the RO is unable to secure these records, \r\nit must notify the Veteran and (a) identify \r\nthe specific records it is unable to obtain; \r\n(b) briefly explain the efforts that it made \r\nto obtain those records; (c) describe any \r\nfurther action to be taken with respect to the \r\nclaim; and (d) notify the Veteran that he is \r\nultimately responsible for providing the \r\nevidence.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(b)(2) (West \r\n2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.159(e)(1) (2009).\r\n\r\n3.  Obtain deck logs for the USS Cleveland from \r\nany appropriate source (such as the National \r\nArchives and Records Administration (NARA) or the \r\nU.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research \r\nCenter (JSRRC)), for September 1977.  All efforts \r\nto obtain these records, including follow-up \r\nrequests, if appropriate, should be fully \r\ndocumented.  Any negative responses should be \r\ndocumented in the file.\r\n\r\nIf the RO is unable to secure these records, \r\nit must notify the Veteran and (a) identify \r\nthe specific records it is unable to obtain; \r\n(b) briefly explain the efforts that it made \r\nto obtain those records; (c) describe any \r\nfurther action to be taken with respect to the \r\nclaim; and (d) notify the Veteran that he is \r\nultimately responsible for providing the \r\nevidence.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(b)(2) (West \r\n2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.159(e)(1) (2009).\r\n\r\n4.  Review the claims file to ensure that all of \r\nthe foregoing requested development is completed, \r\nand arrange for any additional development \r\nindicated, to include a new VA examination if \r\nwarranted by the new evidence. \r\n\r\n5.  Then re-adjudicate the claim, specifically \r\nincluding consideration of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f); \r\nManual M21-1MR Part III.iv.4.H; and Patton v. \r\nWest, 12 Vet. App 272 (1999).  If the benefit \r\nsought remains denied, issue an appropriate SSOC \r\nand provide the Veteran and his representative \r\nthe requisite period of time to respond.  The \r\ncase should then be returned to the Board for \r\nfurther appellate review, if otherwise in order. \r\nNo action is required of the appellant unless he \r\nis notified.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. \r\nWest, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for \r\nVeterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate \r\naction must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n�� 5109B, 7112 (West 2002).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nLANA K.

Griffin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from November 1977 to November \r\n1997.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from April 2005 and January 2006 decisions of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) North Little Rock, Arkansas \r\nRegional Office (RO).\r\n\r\nThe Board has recharacterized the Veteran's single service \r\nconnection claim for MDD, as stated on the title page, to comply \r\nwith Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).\r\n\r\nThe Board previously remanded the present matter for further \r\ndevelopment in March 2009.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if \r\nfurther action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran presently seeks to establish service connection for \r\nacquired psychiatric disorder, to include MDD and PTSD, to \r\ninclude as secondary to service connected disorders.  In March \r\n2009, the Board instructed the AMC/RO to contact the Veteran and \r\nrequest that he furnish additional information concerning the \r\ndeath of a fellow service member, as noted on his March 2006 \r\nAppeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (VA Form 9), and then to \r\ncontact the U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center \r\n(JSRRC) to attempt to verify the claimed incident.  An October \r\n2009 correspondence to the Veteran documented the AMC/RO's \r\nrequest for the aforementioned information, but the Veteran's \r\napparently failed to respond.  As the Veteran did not reply, the \r\nAMC/RO undertook no additional development efforts and issued a \r\nMarch 2010 supplemental statement of the case (SSOC).  \r\nNonetheless, the Board's March 2009 remand instructions did not \r\ndirect the AMC/RO to contract the JSRRC only if the Veteran \r\nreplied.  The Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (Court) has \r\ncontinually held that a remand by the Board confers upon the \r\nVeteran \"as a matter of law, the right to compliance with the \r\nremand orders.\"  Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998).  \r\nAs such, although the Veteran failed to supply any additional \r\ninformation, the AMC/RO still was obligated make an attempt to \r\nconfirm the aforementioned incident with the JSRRC, based on the \r\ninformation of record.  Id.  Accordingly, the Board is without \r\ndiscretion and the Veteran's claim must again be remanded, to \r\nensure the remand instructions outlined in the March 2009 Board \r\nremand are attempted.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of clarity, the Board finds it necessary to again \r\nexamine the facts surrounding the Veteran's claimed in-service \r\nincident, which he maintains caused his current acquired \r\npsychiatric disorder.  In March 2006, the Veteran submitted an \r\naccount of being in very close proximity at the time a fellow \r\nservice member was killed and of having to view autopsy photos \r\nrelated to this incident.  The Veteran further indicated that \r\nthis event occurred while he was stationed in Mannheim, Germany.  \r\nSee Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connection for \r\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (VA Form 21-0781), April \r\n23, 2006.  A review of the Veteran's service personnel records \r\nindicates that he was stationed in Germany (i) with Company B, \r\n2nd Battalion, 81st Armor from June 1978 to November 1980; and \r\n(ii) with the 512th Maintenance Company from February 1982 to May \r\n1983.  By no means does this information provide the most precise \r\nor specific information; however, the evidence is sufficiently \r\nspecific as to request JSSRC attempt to verify the Veteran's \r\naccount.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the Veteran was provided a VA examination in December \r\n2005, the Board finds this examination inadequate.  Initially, \r\nthe Board notes that the Veteran is competent to provide his \r\naccount of witnessing a fellow service member killed, having \r\nviewed autopsy photos, and self-medicating his depression \r\nsymptoms with alcohol.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, \r\n1337 (2006); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. \r\nCir. 2007); see also VA Form 21-0781, April 23, 2006.  A review \r\nof the December 2005 VA examination report also documents the \r\nVeteran's competent account of self-medicating depression \r\nsymptoms in-service and his diagnosis with MDD.  Nonetheless, the \r\nexaminer failed to address whether any acquired psychiatric \r\ndisorder, to include MDD and/or PTSD, (i) had its onset in-\r\nservice, (ii) was related to the Veteran's military service, \r\nand/or (iii) whether any such disorder was caused and/or \r\naggravated by any service-connected disorder.  These etiological \r\nquestions are central to evaluating the Veteran's service \r\nconnection claim, and the Board finds the December 2005 VA \r\nexamination, in this respect, inadequate.  Accordingly, the Board \r\nhas no choice but to remand the claim once again to obtain a \r\nsufficient medical examination.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. \r\nApp. 303, 311 (2007); see also Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. \r\n1, 12 (2001) (holding that the Board has a duty, under 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 19.9(a), to remand a case \"[i]f further evidence or \r\nclarification of the evidence or correction of a procedural \r\ndefect is essential for a proper appellate decision\").\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  The AMC/RO should again contact the \r\nVeteran and request additional information \r\nthat would assist in the verification of the \r\nincident in which the Veteran witnessed the \r\ndeath of a fellow soldier as noted in his \r\nMarch 2006 substantive appeal, including, but \r\nnot necessarily limited to, the date, time, \r\nand location of the incident, the \r\ncircumstances surrounding the incident, and \r\nthe identity of any other witnesses to the \r\nincident.\r\n\r\n2.  After giving the Veteran an appropriate \r\namount of time to reply, and even if the \r\nVeteran provides no additional information, \r\nthe AMC/RO should contact U.S. Army and Joint \r\nServices Records Research Center (JSRRC), and \r\nrequest that JSRRC research the claimed in-\r\nservice incident, and specifically ascertain \r\nwhether anyone (i) with Company B, 2nd \r\nBattalion, 81st Armor, from June 1978 to \r\nNovember 1980; and/or (ii) with the 512th \r\nMaintenance Company, from February 1982 to \r\nMay 1983, was killed, as described by the \r\nVeteran.  All development efforts, and/or \r\nnegative response(s), should be in \r\nwriting and associated with the claims \r\nfolder.  \r\n\r\n3.  After the aforementioned development \r\nhas been completed and all records, \r\nand/or the negative response, associated \r\nwith the claims folder, the Veteran should \r\nbe afforded another VA examination to \r\ndetermine the current nature and etiology of \r\nany acquired psychiatric disorder, to include \r\na major depressive disorder and PTSD.  The \r\nclaims folder should be reviewed by the \r\nexaminer and that review should be indicated \r\nin the examination report.  The examiner \r\nshould record the full history of the \r\nVeteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, to \r\ninclude a major depressive disorder and PTSD, \r\nincluding the Veteran's own account of the \r\netiology of his disability.  \r\n\r\nThe VA examiner's opinion should specifically \r\naddress the following:\r\n\r\na)  Diagnose any current acquired \r\npsychiatric disorder.\r\n\r\nb)  Provide a full multi-axial diagnosis \r\nand specifically state whether or not \r\neach criterion for a diagnosis of PTSD is \r\nmet pursuant to the Diagnostic and \r\nStatistic Manual of Mental Disorders, \r\nFourth Edition (DSM- IV).\r\n\r\nc)  If a diagnosis of PTSD is warranted, \r\nspecify the specific in-service stressor \r\nor stressors upon which that diagnosis is \r\nbased, to include any of the Veteran's \r\nservice-connected disabilities.\r\n\r\nd)  Discuss whether it is at least as \r\nlikely as not that any other currently \r\ndiagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder \r\nis related to the Veteran's period of \r\nservice and/or any of his service-\r\nconnected disorders.\r\n\r\nA complete rationale must also be \r\nprovided for all opinions given. \r\n\r\n4.  The AMC/RO should thereafter review the \r\nadditional evidence that has been obtained \r\nand determine whether the benefit sought on \r\nappeal may now be granted.  If the benefit \r\nsought on appeal remains denied, the Veteran \r\nand his representative should be furnished a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case and given \r\nthe opportunity to respond thereto.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. \r\nWest, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for \r\nVeterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate \r\naction must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Elwood, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from November 1972 to August \r\n1976.\r\n\r\nThis matter initially came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) from a November 2002 rating decision of the Department of \r\nVeterans' Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Pittsburgh, \r\nPennsylvania.  In that decision, the RO denied entitlement to \r\nservice connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn May 2004, the Board remanded this matter for further \r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIn April 2009, the Board denied the Veteran's claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD.  The Veteran appealed the Board's denial to \r\nthe United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).\r\n\r\nIn July 2010, the Court vacated the Board's decision and remanded \r\nthe case for readjudication in compliance with directives \r\nspecified in a July 2010 Joint Motion filed by counsel for the \r\nVeteran and the VA Secretary.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nIn October 2010, the Board was notified by the RO that the \r\nVeteran died in September 2010.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nDue to the death of the Veteran, the Board has no jurisdiction to \r\nadjudicate the merits of this claim at this time.  38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n7104(a) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 20.1302 (2009); but see \r\nVeterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-389, \r\n� 212, 122 Stat. 4145, 4151 (2008). \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the \r\nappeal.  As a matter of law, appellants' claims do not survive \r\ntheir deaths.  Zevalkink v. Brown, 102 F.3d 1236, 1243-44 (Fed. \r\nCir. 1996); Smith v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 330, 333-34 (1997); \r\nLandicho v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 42, 47 (1994).  This appeal on the \r\nmerits has become moot by virtue of the death of the Veteran and \r\nmust be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n7104(a) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 20.1302 (2009).\r\n\r\nIn reaching this determination, the Board intimates no opinion as \r\nto the merits of this appeal or to any derivative claim brought \r\nby a survivor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. � 20.1106 (2009).  \r\n\r\nThe Board's dismissal of this appeal does not affect the right of \r\nan eligible person to file a request to be substituted as the \r\nappellant for purposes of processing the claim to completion.  \r\nSuch request must be filed not later than one year after the date \r\nof the appellant's death.

As these benefits sought have been \r\ngranted in full, the issues are no longer before the Board on \r\nappeal.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThere is credible medical evidence that service-connected \r\nsubstance and alcohol abuse in part caused or aggravated the \r\nVeteran's peptic ulcer disease.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for peptic ulcer disease have \r\nbeen met.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1110, 1112 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310 (2009).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nVA has a duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a \r\nclaim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, \r\n5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2010); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, \r\n3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326(a) (2009).  In this case, the Board is \r\ngranting in full the benefit sought on appeal.  Accordingly, \r\nassuming, without deciding, that any error was committed with \r\nrespect to either the duty to notify or the duty to assist, such \r\nerror was harmless and will not be further discussed.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served as a U.S. Navy seaman and ship's serviceman \r\naboard a frigate including several deployments to the Western \r\nPacific Theater of Operations.  The Veteran was awarded the \r\nVietnam Service Medal and Combat Action Ribbon.  He contends that \r\nhis peptic ulcer disease first manifested shortly after service \r\nand is related to service or secondary to other service-connected \r\ndisorders. \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting from a \r\ndisease or injury incurred in or aggravated by military service.  \r\nFor the showing of chronic disease in service, there must be a \r\ncombination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease \r\nentity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the \r\ntime.  If chronicity in service is not established, evidence of \r\ncontinuity of symptoms after discharge is required to support the \r\nclaim.  Service connection may also be granted for a disease \r\ndiagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that \r\npertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred \r\nin service.   38 U.S.C.A. � 1110, 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.\r\n \r\nIn order to establish service connection for a claimed disorder, \r\nthere must be\r\n(1) medical evidence of current disability; (2) medical, or in \r\ncertain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or \r\naggravation of a disease or injury; and \r\n(3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service \r\ndisease or injury and the current disability.  See Hickson v. \r\nWest, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); see also Degmetich v. Brown, \r\n104 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Brammer v. Derwinski, \r\n3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).  \r\n \r\nSome chronic diseases may be presumed to have been incurred in \r\nservice, although not otherwise established as such, if \r\nmanifested to a degree of ten percent or more within one year of \r\nthe date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1112(a)(1); \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.307(a)(3); see 38 U.S.C.A. � 1101(3) and 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.309(a) (listing applicable chronic diseases, including peptic \r\nulcers).\r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted for a disability that is \r\nproximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease \r\nor injury.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310(a).  When service connection is \r\nestablished for a secondary condition, the secondary condition \r\nshall be considered a part of the original condition.  Id.  \r\nEstablishing service connection on a secondary basis requires \r\nevidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists \r\nand (2) that the current disability was either (a) proximately \r\ncaused by or (b) proximately aggravated by a service-connected \r\ndisability.  Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en \r\nbanc).  \r\n\r\nService treatment records are silent for any symptoms, diagnoses, \r\nor treatment for gastrointestinal disorders.  The file contains \r\nan undated and incomplete record of a discharge physical \r\nexamination with no observations or conclusions relevant to any \r\nspecific physical system and no concurrent medical history \r\nquestionnaire.  The claims file contains no records of medical \r\ncare or statements or claims for disability compensation from the \r\nVeteran prior to 1996.  \r\n\r\nIn December 1996, the Veteran received inpatient VA treatment for \r\n28 days for alcohol and cocaine dependence.  The attending \r\nphysician noted that the Veteran had a 32 year history of alcohol \r\nand substance abuse and a history of peptic ulcer disease.  \r\nLimited outpatient treatment records in 1999 and 2000 and a March \r\n2000 VA general medical examination were silent for any symptoms \r\nor treatment of upper gastric disease.  However, the Veteran \r\ncontinued to receive counseling and treatment for substance \r\nabuse, and mental health clinicians frequently noted the history \r\nof peptic ulcer disease as a relevant general medical factor.  \r\nAdditional VA outpatient treatment records through February 2008 \r\nshow occasional notations of the presence of an ongoing upper \r\ngastrointestinal disorder but with few clinically observed \r\nsymptoms and no treatment other than prescriptions for gastric \r\nacid inhibitor medications. \r\n\r\nIn September 2009, a VA physician noted a review of the claims \r\nfile and the Veteran's report of receiving a diagnosis of peptic \r\nulcer disease with gastroesophageal reflux disease in 1977, \r\nregular use of over-the-counter  and prescription medication for \r\nstomach acidity, and current symptoms of acid reflux, heartburn, \r\nand indigestion on a daily basis.  The Veteran also reported that \r\nhe ceased drug abuse in 2003 and greatly reduced alcohol \r\nconsumption starting in 2006.  The physician noted that a \r\nconcurrent upper gastrointestinal test series showed a hiatal \r\nhernia with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), significant \r\nmucosal hypertrophy of the stomach, and a small distal duodenal \r\nbulb.  The physician diagnosed hiatal hernia with GERD and a \r\nduodenal ulcer.   The physician noted that there was no evidence \r\nof the onset of peptic ulcer disease in service.   He noted that \r\nthe cause of the disease was multifactorial and was likely the \r\nresult of prolonged use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, \r\nthe hiatal hernia, and a history of drug and alcohol abuse and \r\ncigarette smoking.  The physician was unable to further determine \r\nwhich of the causes, if any, were dominant.  \r\n\r\nService connection for peptic ulcer disease is not warranted on a \r\ndirect basis because there is no credible lay or medical evidence \r\nthat the disease first manifested in service or within the \r\npresumptive period after service.  The Veteran reported that he \r\nwas first diagnosed with an upper gastric disorder in 1977, two \r\nyears after service.  There is no credible lay or medical \r\nevidence that the disease is directly related to any aspect of \r\nservice.  \r\n\r\nThe Board concludes that service connection for peptic ulcer \r\ndisease is warranted on a secondary basis as a result of service-\r\nconnected substance and alcohol abuse.  The VA physician in \r\nSeptember 2009 reviewed the entire record and was the only \r\nmedical care provider who addressed the etiology of the disease.  \r\nHe concluded that there were multiple causes for the disease \r\nincluding drug and alcohol abuse.  As substance and alcohol abuse \r\nhas been determined to be service-connected and as the physician \r\nconcluded that the abuse was a contributing and proximately \r\naggravating factor, secondary service connection for peptic ulcer \r\ndisease is warranted.   \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for peptic ulcer disease is granted, subject \r\nto the legal criteria governing the payment of monetary benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nDENNIS F.

D. Jackson, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from August 1969 to August \r\n1971, including a tour in Vietnam from January to December 1970.\r\n\r\nThis appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) is from \r\ndecisions in July 2003, January 2004, and June 2004 by the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Los \r\nAngeles, California.\r\n\r\nThis case was previously before the Board in August 2006 and \r\nagain in May 2009, at which time it was remanded for further \r\ndevelopment and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The Veteran's PTSD is a service-connected disability.\r\n\r\n2.  There is competent and credible, so probative, medical \r\nevidence indicating his PTSD as likely as not aggravates his CAD.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nResolving all reasonable doubt in his favor, the CAD is secondary \r\nto the PTSD.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.102, 3.303, 3.310 (2010).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  The Duties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nAs provided for by the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 \r\n(VCAA), VA has duties to notify and assist claimants in \r\nsubstantiating claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, \r\n5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), \r\n3.159 and 3.326(a).  \r\n\r\nHere, though, since the claim is being granted, the Board need \r\nnot discuss whether there has been compliance with these notice \r\nand duty to assist provisions of the VCAA because the Veteran is \r\nreceiving the requested benefits, regardless.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 20.1102.  See also Shinseki v. Sanders, 129 S. Ct. 1696 (2009).\r\n\r\nII.  General Statutes, Regulations and Cases Pertaining to \r\nService Connection\r\n\r\nIn general, service connection is granted for disability \r\nresulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by \r\nactive military service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110; 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.303(a).\r\n\r\nTo establish entitlement to direct service connection for a \r\nclaimed disability, there must be:  (1) medical evidence of \r\ncurrent disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay \r\nevidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or \r\ninjury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus or link between the \r\nclaimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  \r\nShedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004); \r\nHansen v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 110 (2002).  The determination \r\nas to whether these requirements are met is based on an analysis \r\nof all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its \r\ncredibility and probative value.  Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 \r\n(1999).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nService connection will be presumed for certain chronic diseases, \r\nsuch as cardiovascular disease, if manifested to a compensable \r\ndegree (generally at least \r\n10-percent disabling) within the year after service.  This \r\npresumption, however, is rebuttable by probative evidence to the \r\ncontrary.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.307, \r\n3.309(a).\r\n\r\nService connection also may be granted for any disability shown \r\nafter service, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent \r\nto service, shows the disability was incurred in service.  38 \r\nC.F.R. 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nSecondary service connection may be granted for disability that \r\nis proximately due to or the result of a service-connected \r\ndisease or injury.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310(a).  This includes \r\nsituations where a service-connected disability has aggravated a \r\nnon-service-connected condition; when aggravation of a non-\r\nservice-connected condition is proximately due to or the result \r\nof a service-connected disability, the Veteran will be \r\ncompensated for the degree of disability (but only that degree) \r\nover and above the degree of disability existing prior to the \r\naggravation.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310(b); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. \r\n439 (1995).\r\n\r\nSo service connection may be established either by showing direct \r\nservice incurrence or aggravation or by using applicable \r\npresumptions, if available.  Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. \r\nCir. 1994).\r\n\r\nIII.  Service Connection for CAD\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has diagnoses of CAD dating back to 1998.  He \r\nunderwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) \r\nwith stenting in December 1998 and June 2000.  \r\n\r\nAt the time of his military separation examination in May 1971, \r\nthe Veteran had complained of left anterior chest pains that had \r\nbeen present for approximately three years, and which occurred \r\nabout every two weeks, lasting from one to two days.  But \r\nphysical examination of his heart and vascular system during his \r\nseparation exam was entirely within normal limits, and no \r\npertinent diagnosis was noted.  There also is no clinical \r\ndiagnosis of heart disease until many years later, \r\nuntil as mentioned in 1998, so some 27 years after service.  \r\nMoreover, there is no competent medical evidence indicating the \r\nVeteran's heart disease is directly related to his service (so as \r\nto warrant concluding the condition was directly or even \r\npresumptively incurred in service, since not manifested to the \r\nrequired degree of at least 10-percent disabling within the \r\ninitial, post-service year).  See 38 C.F.R. � 4.104, Diagnostic \r\nCode 7005.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this is not the basis of the Veteran's claim.  He \r\nis alleging, instead, that his service-connected PTSD causes \r\nstress, which affects his heart disability.  The record contains \r\nseveral opinions regarding this claimed cause-and-effect \r\ncorrelation between these two conditions, his PTSD and CAD.  \r\n\r\nFollowing a VA psychiatric examination in June 2003, the examiner \r\nvoiced his opinion that the majority of the Veteran's \"medical \r\nproblems\" were likely the result of his efforts to cope with his \r\nPTSD symptomatology, and that these conditions \"tended to \r\naggravate each other.\"  Further, during VA psychiatric \r\nexamination in September 2006, it was noted the Veteran's \r\n\"anxiety symptoms\" appeared to be aggravating his \"medical \r\nconditions\" and vice versa.\r\n\r\nDuring a VA cardiovascular examination in September 2006, the \r\nexaminer noted the Veteran had several active \"risk factors\" for \r\nCAD, including his age, male sex, hyperlipidemia, and \r\nhypertension.  Moreover, he had a \"long history\" of substantial \r\nstress and was service connected for PTSD.  In the opinion of the \r\nexaminer, stress could certainly contribute to the development of \r\nCAD and may have in fact done this in the Veteran, though \"it was \r\nimpossible to determine which of [his] several risk factors \r\ncontributed what proportion of the risk of coronary disease.\"\r\n\r\nIn a February 2008 statement, a VA nurse practitioner reported \r\nthat she had been providing cardiac care to the Veteran since \r\n2005.  She concluded that it was as likely as not that his PTSD \r\nwith ongoing stress, depression, and anger management issues \r\ncontributed to the development and progression of his CAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn light of the Veteran's medical history, the Board remanded \r\nthis case for an additional medical nexus opinion concerning any \r\npotential clinical relationship or correlation between the \r\nVeteran's CAD and PTSD.  The Veteran resultantly had another VA \r\nexamination in December 2008.  The examiner, however, did not \r\nhave access to the Veteran's claims file for consideration of \r\nthis history and therefore deferred a final decision regarding \r\nthe claim until after having the opportunity to review the file.  \r\nIn an October 2009 addendum, this physician essentially noted \r\nthat other factors - including the Veteran's family history, \r\nhypertension, and dyslipidemia, increased his chances of \r\ndeveloping CAD, and that these conditions outweigh any effect due \r\nto PTSD.  Significantly, however, this commenting physician also \r\nconceded there was some evidence in the medical literature \r\nlinking PTSD and the early development of CAD.  So this examiner \r\nbelieved that it is as likely as not the Veteran's PTSD has at \r\nleast aggravated his CAD.\r\n\r\nIn light of these several medical opinions acknowledging this \r\npurported relationship between the Veteran's PTSD and aggravation \r\nof his CAD, service connection is warranted on this permissible \r\nsecondary basis.  See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 \r\n(1998); Velez v. West, 11 Vet. App. 148, 158 (1998) and \r\nMcQueen v. West, 13 Vet. App. 237 (1999) (all indicating that \r\ncompetent medical nexus evidence is usually required to associate \r\na secondary condition with a service-connected disability).  \r\nThere is no probative evidence in the record to rebut these \r\nfavorable opinions, and the Veteran's medical history and current \r\nfindings seem to substantiate their suppositions.  Certainly \r\nthen, with resolution of all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's \r\nfavor, the claim must be granted.  38 C.F.R. � 3.102; Alemany v. \r\nBrown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for CAD as secondary to the PTSD is granted. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nKeith W.

Andrew Ahlberg, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from April 1965 to January \r\n1967.  \r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(hereinafter Board) on appeal from a February 2008 rating \r\ndecision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (hereinafter VA) \r\nRegional Office in St. Petersburg, Florida, (hereinafter RO).  \r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has been diagnosed to have coronary artery disease \r\nand served in the Republic of Vietnam during the time period when \r\nexposure to herbicides is presumed.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for coronary artery disease \r\nhave been met.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2010).  \r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn November 2000, the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 \r\n(VCAA) was signed into law.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, \r\n5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2005).  VA has issued \r\nregulations implementing the VCAA.  38 C.F.R. � 3.102, 3.156(a), \r\n3.159, 3.326 (2010).  Without deciding whether the notice and \r\ndevelopment requirements of VCAA have been satisfied in the \r\npresent case, it is the Board's conclusion that this law does not \r\npreclude the Board from adjudicating the issue involving the \r\nVeteran's claim for service connection for coronary artery \r\ndisease.  This is so because the Board is taking favorable action \r\nwith respect to this claim in the decision below.  As such, this \r\ndecision poses no risk of prejudice to the Veteran.  See, e.g., \r\nBernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384 (1993); see also Pelegrini v. \r\nPrincipi, 17 Vet. App. 412 (2004); VAOPGCPREC 16-92, 57 Fed. Reg. \r\n49,747 (1992).\r\n\r\nA presumption of service connection now exists if a Veteran is \r\ndiagnosed to have certain enumerated diseases associated with \r\nexposure to certain herbicide agents, to include ischemic heart \r\ndisease (including, but not limited to, atherosclerotic \r\ncardiovascular disease including coronary artery disease \r\n(including coronary spasm) and coronary bypass surgery).  See 38 \r\nC.F.R. �� 3.307, 3.309 (2010); 38 U.S.C.A. � 1116 (West 2002).  A \r\nVeteran who served in the Republic of Vietnam during the period \r\nbeginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, shall be \r\npresumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide \r\nagent, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that he \r\nor she was not exposed to any such agent during that service.  \r\nSee 38 C.F.R. � 3.307(a)(6)(iii) (2010).  \r\n\r\nThe medical evidence of record clearly establishes that the \r\nVeteran has been diagnosed to have coronary artery disease.  In \r\naddition, it is presumed that the Veteran was exposed to \r\nherbicide agents while he was stationed in the Republic of \r\nVietnam because such service occurred during the time frame set \r\nout by regulation as shown by way of the Veteran's DD Form 214.  \r\n\r\nAs it is presumed the Veteran was exposed to herbicides as a \r\nresult of his service in the Republic of Vietnam, and he has been \r\ndiagnosed to have coronary artery disease, the Veteran is \r\nentitled to service connection for this disability on a \r\npresumptive basis under 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(e).  Therefore, and \r\nnotwithstanding the contention that service connection for \r\ncoronary artery disease should be granted as secondary to PTSD, \r\nthe Board grants the claim of entitlement to service connection \r\nfor coronary artery disease.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1116 (West 2002); 38 \r\nC.F.R. �� 3.307, 3.309 (2010).\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for coronary artery disease is \r\ngranted. \r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nMICHAEL E.

L. Prichard, Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active service from March 1980 to March 1985.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal of a September 2006 rating decision of the Winston-\r\nSalem, North Carolina, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of \r\nVeterans Affairs (VA).  \r\n\r\nIn November 2010, the Veteran offered testimony at a hearing \r\nbefore the undersigned Veterans Law Judge at the RO.  A \r\ntranscript of the hearing is contained in the claims folder.  The \r\nVeteran submitted additional evidence at the hearing, but he has \r\nwaived initial review by the RO.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the Veteran if \r\nfurther action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he has developed PTSD as a result of \r\ntwo separate incidents during active service.  He states that two \r\nshipmates were killed in accidents aboard the USS Sumter, with \r\nthe first accident in 1981 and the second in 1983.  He also \r\nasserts that he was in a combat zone off the coast of Beirut when \r\nover 280 Marines were killed by a terrorist.  He asserts this has \r\ncontributed to his stress.  He argues that he does not have \r\nschizophrenia, but rather has PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe records show that the September 2006 rating decision which \r\ndenied the Veteran's claim did so on the basis that there was no \r\nthere was no diagnosis of PTSD, and the current diagnosis of \r\nschizophrenia was not shown in service or until many years after \r\ndischarge from service. \r\n\r\nThe record further shows that no attempt was made to verify the \r\nVeteran's stressors, presumably because there was no diagnosis of \r\nPTSD.  He was also not provided a VA examination, again \r\npresumably because of the lack of current PTSD diagnosis and the \r\nlack of evidence of schizophrenia during service.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the evidence received at the November 2010 hearing \r\nconsists of VA treatment records dating from January 2009 to \r\nApril 2009.  These records show that the Veteran was diagnosed as \r\nhaving PTSD in January 2009 by a VA psychiatrist, and that he \r\ncontinued to be treated for PTSD as well as other psychiatric \r\ndisabilities by this psychiatrist.  Although the examiner did not \r\nexpressly link the Veteran's claimed stressors to his PTSD, they \r\nwere cited in the report as among the stressors reported by the \r\nVeteran.  \r\n\r\nUnder the VCAA, VA is obliged to provide an examination when the \r\nrecord contains competent evidence that the claimant has a \r\ncurrent disability or signs and symptoms of a current disability, \r\nthe record indicates that the disability or signs and symptoms of \r\ndisability may be associated with active service; and the record \r\ndoes not contain sufficient information to make a decision on the \r\nclaim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(d) (West 2002); McLendon v. \r\nNicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  The evidence of a link \r\nbetween current disability and service must be competent.  Wells \r\nv. Principi, 326 F.3d 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  The threshold for \r\nfinding a link between current disability and service is low.  \r\nLocklear v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 410 (2006); McLendon v. \r\nNicholson, at 83. \r\n\r\nIn this case, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD.  He \r\nhas reported plausible stressors that are consistent with the \r\nfacts and circumstances of his service.  Therefore, as they are \r\nnot combat related, the Board finds that development must be \r\ntaken to determine whether or not his claimed stressors can be \r\nverified.  Then, if they are verified, the Veteran must be \r\nscheduled for a VA examination to determine whether or not his \r\nPTSD is related to one or more of his in-service stressors.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  Verify the location of the USS Sumter \r\nduring the time the Veteran was assigned \r\nto the ship.  If additional records are \r\nneeded to ascertain when he was aboard the \r\nship, that development should be \r\nundertaken.  Thereafter, send a list of \r\nthe Veteran's reported stressors to the \r\nU.S. Army and Joint Services Records \r\nResearch Center (JSRRC) or other \r\nappropriate authority.  This should \r\ninclude the 1981 death of Roger Cunningham \r\nand the 1983 death of Robert Madden, both \r\naboard the USS Sumter.  Request that all \r\nappropriate records be searched that might \r\nverify the occurrence of the claimed \r\nstressors, to include but not limited to \r\nunit histories and ship's logs.  If JSRRC \r\nsuggest that other entities be contacted \r\nfor records, contact those entities and \r\nrequest those records.\r\n\r\n2.  Obtain all VA record pertaining to the \r\ntreatment of the Veteran's psychiatric \r\ndisabilities dating from April 2009 to the \r\npresent and associate them with the claims \r\nfolder.\r\n\r\n3.  Schedule the Veteran for a VA \r\npsychiatric examination.  All indicated \r\ntests and studies should be conducted.  \r\nThe claims folder must be provided to the \r\nexaminer for use in the study of this \r\ncase.  After review of the record and \r\ncompletion of the examination, the \r\nexaminer should attempt to provide the \r\nfollowing opinions:\r\n\r\na) Do the Veteran's current psychiatric \r\ndiagnoses include PTSD?  If so, is it as \r\nlikely as not (50 percent probability or \r\nhigher) that the Veteran's PTSD is the \r\nresult of one or more of the verified in-\r\nservice stressors? \r\n\r\nb) If the Veteran does not have PTSD, or \r\nif his PTSD is not related to in-service \r\nstressors, does the Veteran have any other \r\ncurrent psychiatric diagnoses?  If so, is \r\nit as likely as not (50 percent \r\nprobability or more) that any current \r\npsychiatric disability was incurred due to \r\nactive service or event or occurrence \r\ntherein?\r\n\r\n4.  After the development requested above \r\nhas been completed to the extent possible, \r\nreview the record.  If any benefit sought \r\non appeal, for which a notice of \r\ndisagreement has been filed, remains \r\ndenied, the Veteran and representative \r\nshould be furnished a supplemental \r\nstatement of the case and given the \r\nopportunity to respond thereto.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the case should be returned to the Board, if in \r\norder.  The Board intimates no opinion as to the ultimate outcome \r\nof this case.  The Veteran need take no action until otherwise \r\nnotified.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for \r\nVeterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate \r\naction must be handled in an expeditious manner.

I. Velez, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant had active service from March 1982 to February 1986 \r\nand from November 1986 to November 1988.\r\n\r\nThis matter came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on \r\nappeal from a decision of July 2002 by the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Petersburg, Florida.\r\n\r\nThe appellant was scheduled for a hearing before the Board in \r\nDecember 2007 but he failed to appear.  \r\n\r\nIn September 2008, the Board remanded the claim for further \r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if \r\nfurther action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn the case of Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998), the \r\nUnited States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\"the Court\") \r\nheld that a remand by the Board imposes upon the Secretary of the \r\nVA a concomitant duty to ensure compliance with the terms of the \r\nremand.  It was further held that where the remand orders of the \r\nBoard are not complied with, the Board errs in failing to insure \r\ncompliance.  The Court also noted that its holdings in that case \r\nare precedent to be followed in all cases presently in remand \r\nstatus.  Id.\r\n\r\nIn a Board remand of September 2008, the RO was requested to \r\nschedule the appellant for a VA examination to determine whether \r\nhe has PTSD that is due to any corroborated in-service stressor.  \r\nThe Board identified two claimed stressors: coming under fire \r\nwhile serving in Honduras in 1983, which needed verification, and \r\nan injury to the right ankle when a goal post fell on him which \r\nwas corroborated by his service treatment records.\r\n\r\nThe RO did not schedule a VA examination noting that the claimed \r\nstressor of having come under fire in Honduras in 1983 had not \r\nbeen verified.  However, there was already a verified event in \r\nthe file.  Moreover, the Board did not make the request for a VA \r\nexamination conditional on the verification of any one particular \r\nstressor.  Therefore, the Board finds that the RO did not comply \r\nwith the Board's order and unfortunately, this case must be \r\nremanded once again.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Board notes that the Court has held that claims \r\nfor service connection for PTSD may encompass claims for service \r\nconnection for other psychiatric diagnoses.  Clemons v. Shinseki, \r\n23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  In the instant case, the record shows \r\nthat the appellant has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder and \r\nanxiety disorder.  Indeed, VA outpatient treatment records of \r\nMarch 2005 show a diagnosis of bi-polar disorder and VA treatment \r\nrecords of September 2005 show a diagnosis of anxiety disorder.  \r\nThe RO has not adjudicated this claim.  Pursuant to the holding \r\nin Clemons, the Board finds that there is a pending claim for \r\nservice connection for bi-polar disorder and anxiety disorder \r\nwhich must be adjudicated.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Schedule the appellant for a VA \r\npsychiatric examination to determine \r\nwhether he has PTSD that is due to any \r\ncorroborated, in-service event to include \r\na right ankle injury when a goal post fell \r\non him.  The examiner should confirm the \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD and should specifically \r\nidentify the stressor or stressors that \r\nsupport the diagnosis, if any.  The \r\nexaminer should also confirm the diagnosis \r\nof any other psychiatric disability, to \r\ninclude bi-polar disorder and anxiety \r\ndisorder.  An opinion must be provided as \r\nto whether it is as likely as not (i.e., \r\nto at least a 50-50 degree of probability) \r\nthat any currently diagnosed psychiatric \r\ndisorder to include PTSD, bi-polar \r\ndisorder and/or anxiety disorder, was \r\ncaused or aggravated by service, or \r\nwhether such an etiology or relationship \r\nis unlikely (i.e., less than a 50-50 \r\nprobability).  The claims folder should be \r\nmade available to the examiner.  A \r\ncomplete rationale for any opinion \r\nrendered must be provided.\r\n\r\n2.  The RO should issue a Statement of the \r\nCase or Supplemental Statement of the case \r\nin regard to any other psychiatric \r\ndisorder.  \r\n\r\nIf upon completion of the above action the claim remains denied, \r\nthe case should be returned to the Board after compliance with \r\nrequisite appellate procedures.  The appellant has the right to \r\nsubmit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters \r\nthe Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet.

Olson, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active military service from August 1967 to August 1969.\r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following Board Remands in May 2006 and November 2009.  This matter was originally on appeal from a March 2003 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO) in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran originally filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD. Although not claimed by the Veteran, the Board expanded his original claim to include all psychiatric disorders.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (a claimant without medical expertise cannot be expected to precisely delineate the diagnosis of his mental illness; he filed a claim for the affliction his mental condition, whatever it is, causes him).  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nTwo of the Veteran's alleged in-service stressors have been verified; the Veteran's treating psychiatric professionals endorse a finding of PTSD associated with the verified combat stressors.    \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nResolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304 (2010).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nPreliminary Matters\r\n\r\nThe Board has thoroughly reviewed all the evidence in the Veteran's claims folders.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, the extensive evidence submitted by the Veteran or on his behalf.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (the Board must review the entire record, but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence).  The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claim.  The Veteran must not assume that the Board has overlooked pieces of evidence that are not explicitly discussed herein.  See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (the law requires only that the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the Veteran).  \r\n\t\r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000\r\n\r\nAs provided for by the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326(a) (2010).  \r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application for benefits, VA is required to notify the claimant and his or her representative, if any, of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  Proper notice from VA must inform the claimant of any information and evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to service connection claims, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that, upon receipt of an application for a service-connection claim, 38 U.S.C. � 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) require VA to review the information and the evidence presented with the claim and to provide the claimant with notice of what information and evidence not previously provided, if any, will assist in substantiating, or is necessary to substantiate, each of the five elements of the claim, including notice of what is required to establish service connection and that a disability rating and an effective date for the award of benefits will be assigned if service connection is awarded.  Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).  \r\n\r\nThe Board observes that in light of the favorable outcome of this appeal, any perceived lack of notice or development under the VCAA should not be considered prejudicial.  \r\n\r\nService Connection\r\n\r\nService connection means that the facts establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated during service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a) (2010).  Service connection may also be established for a current disability on the basis of a presumption under the law that certain chronic diseases manifesting themselves to a certain degree within a certain time after service must have had their onset in service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1112 and 1137 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304, 3.307 and 3.309(a) (2010).  When a chronic disease is not present during service, service connection may be established under 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b) by evidence of continuity of symptomatology.  When a disease is first diagnosed after service, service connection can still be granted for that condition if the evidence shows it was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).  To prevail on the issue of service connection there must be medical evidence of a current disability; medical evidence, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service occurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and medical evidence of a nexus between an in-service injury or disease and the current disability.  See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); see also Pond v. West, 12 Vet App. 341, 346 (1999).    \r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) (2010); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2010).  38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) requires that diagnoses of mental disorders conform to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).\r\n\r\nOn the question of the occurrence of an in-service stressor to support the diagnosis of PTSD, the evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of an in-service stressor varies depending on whether or not the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy.  Gaines v. West, 11 Vet. App. 353, 358 (1998).\r\n\r\nIf it is determined through military citation or other supportive evidence that a Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, and the claimed stressor is related to combat, the Veteran's lay testimony regarding the reported stressor must be accepted as conclusive evidence as to the actual occurrence and no further development or corroborative evidence will be necessary, provided that the testimony is found to be satisfactory and consistent with the circumstances, conditions or hardships of such service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d), (f).\r\n\r\nThe phrase \"engaged in combat with the enemy\" means that the Veteran must have personally participated in a fight or encounter with a military foe or hostile unit or instrumentality.  The fact that the Veteran served in a \"combat zone\" does not necessarily mean that he engaged in combat against the enemy.  Whether or not a Veteran \"engaged in combat with the enemy\" must be determined through recognized citations or other official records.  No single item of evidence is determinative, and VA must assess the credibility, probative value, and relative weight of each item.  Any assertions of combat service are not ignored, but are evaluated along with other evidence.  A mere assertion of combat service, alone, is insufficient to establish this fact.  VAOPGCPREC 12-99; Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91 (1993) (mere presence in a combat zone is not sufficient to establish combat service).\r\n\r\nIn this case, in statements, the Veteran asserted that his PTSD has its origin in combat service.  A Veteran's assertions that he engaged in combat, even if they are unsupported by other record evidence, may (but not must) be accepted as credible evidence that the Veteran did, in fact, engage in combat activities.  See Stone v. Nicholson, 480 F.3d 1111, 1113 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (observing that the law does not require VA to accept the Veteran's own assertions that he had engaged in combat); Gaines v. West, 11 Vet. App. 353, 359 (1998)(observing that although VA was not required to accept the Veteran's assertions that he engaged in combat, it was required to explain why his testimony was not persuasive).  \r\n\r\nIn this case, the Veteran's assertions that he engaged in combat is unsupported by any evidence of record.  The Veteran's service records are absent objective evidence of combat-related awards or other information that would denote combat experience.  None of the medals that the Veteran received, to include the National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, and Vietnam Service Medal, denote combat service.  There is no indication of receipt of such combat-related citations as the Purple Heart Medal or the Combat Infantryman Badge.  See 71 Fed. Reg. 17276-17334 (Apr. 6, 2006) (describing criteria for award of decorations, medals, ribbons and similar devices).  The Board observes that the Veteran's military occupational specialty was as a combat engineer, however, this is not dispositive of the issue.  In short, there is no objective evidence of record to corroborate the Veteran's assertion of participation in combat with the enemy during service. \r\n\r\nDuring the course of his appeal, the Veteran has identified numerous stressors as well as location and timing of stressors including digging a ditch to bury dead Vietcong, coming under attack by friendly fire and taking cover in a small foxhole with 13 other people, mine sweeping, and receiving enemy fire on his arrival in Vietnam on January 14, 1968 and in later in February 1968 at Black Horse area.  The Veteran also reported going on patrols in February 1968 and coming under enemy fire, riding in a truck that hit a mine and turned over, and coming under fire while working on a helicopter airfield in March 1968 somewhere near the Cambodian border.  The Veteran also reported witnessing a bull dozer dumping dead bodies (dressed in black pajamas and with green uniforms) into a large and wide ditch near Bien Hoa and witnessing the execution of two Vietcong teenagers.  \r\n\r\nIn July 2009, the Veteran submitted copies of photographs which he had submitted previously in March 2009.  One picture is of a bridge reportedly damaged by enemy fire.  The Veteran stated that he was working at the bridge (in August 1968 between Phu Bai and Hue City) when the attack occurred.\r\n\r\nAn Operational Report - Lessons Learned (OR-LL) submitted by the 11th Armored Cavalry regiment for the time periods ending January 30, 1968 and April 30, 1968, state that during these reporting time periods, the main base camp location for the Regiment was located at Blackhorse Base Camp.  The OR-LL documents that during these reporting time periods elements of the regiment were subjected to several enemy engagements, and that on March 9, 1968, Blackhorse Base Camp received an enemy mortar attack resulting in nine U.S. wounded in action.  \r\n\r\nAn OR-LL for the 27th Engineer Battalion for February, March, and April 1968, 2 soldiers were killed in action and 36 soldiers and 2 officers were wounded in action. \r\n\r\nAn OR-LL submitted by the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment for the time periods ending January 30, 1968 and April 30, 1968 noted that elements of the regiment were subjected to several enemy engagements and that on March 9, 1968, Blackhorse Base Camp received an enemy mortar attack resulting in nine U.S. wounded in action.  Also enclosed was list of men from the Veteran's battalion who died during the war.  During the Veteran's tour in Vietnam, J.R. died on January [redacted], 1968 and J.W. died on June [redacted], 1968.  \r\n\r\nOf record is Annex G (Artillery) to TET Offensive After Action Report and a Memorandum to Files indicating that the following was used to verify the Veteran's stressor:  The TET Offensive After-Action Report found in the Military History share drive indicates that the 11th Calvary was in the Long Bing/Bien Hoa area in 1968.  The Veteran has submitted multiple stressor statements.  The Veteran states he was assigned with the 11th Calvary and alleges the following stressors:  On March 2, 1968, he alleges being part of an involuntary mission, which arrived in Bien Hoa, where he boarded a helicopter for an unknown destination.  During this mission, he alleges being fired upon and sharing one foxhole barely large enough for 2 people with 15 people.  He alleges arriving in Long Binh on March 15, 1968.  He alleges passing through Bien Hoa on March 20, 1968.  While there, he saw soldiers operating a front loader and throwing dead bodies into a ditch.  The stressors described above are verified based upon the TET Offensive After-Action Report.  This report shows the 11th Calvary in the Long Binh/Bien Hoa area.  The Veteran states he was assigned to the 11th Calvary.  There is no evidence in his file to the contrary.\r\n  \r\nThe Board finds that these stressors have been verified by the service department, and that there is credible supporting evidence that these claimed in-service stressors occurred.  Thus, the remaining questions are whether there is medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) and a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and a verified in-service stressor.\r\n\r\nPost-service medical records indicate that in March 1977, March 1981, August 1985, November 1987, and January 1992, the Veteran's psychiatric health was evaluated as normal.  On Reports of Medication History completed in conjunction with March 1997 and March 1971 physical examinations, the Veteran denied ever having depression or excessive worry, nervous trouble of any sort.  On Reports of Medical History completed in conjunction with August 1985, November 1987, and January 1992 physical examinations, the Veteran indicates that he had had nervous trouble.  The examiner elaborated that the Veteran denied any significant problem with nerves and that he simply states that he get nervous when upset for some reason.  \r\n\r\nInitially, the Board notes that the record is replete with diagnoses of PTSD.  The question remains whether these diagnoses were in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) and whether the diagnoses were based on the verified in-service stressors.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran underwent a VA PTSD examination in November 2001.  The examiner, Dr. M.M., reviewed the Veteran's claims file and after interview of the Veteran and mental status examination, diagnosed the Veteran with phase of life problem.  Dr. M.M. noted that the Veteran reported that in March 1968, he and other members of the engineering team were called to dig a ditch because there had been a heavy attack the day before and they put all the dead Vietcong in that ditch.  The Veteran also reported that the terrorist attack in New York brought back memories of a situation where they were attacked by American planes by mistake.  He said that he was part of a 13-man team and they were sent to the DMZ to repair a landing site for helicopters.  The Veteran reported that all of a sudden they were under attack by American planes and the only place where they could protect themselves was a small foxhole.  The Veteran also reported to have been part of a demolition team that had to localize mines and that there were situations in which fellow soldiers were blown up by mines that they were unable to detect.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner noted that the Veteran did not fulfill diagnostic criteria for PTSD.  The examiner noted that the Veteran did not report any difficulties in terms of his job performance, his performance in the National Guard, and in the Reserve.  There were no problems in his interpersonal relations, and no significant problems except for disturbed sleep.  The examiner noted that the Veteran said that all throughout the years that he worked, his mind was always distracted and he was occupied and involved with his work but that after he retired, he basically had nothing to do and thought about all his previous experiences, including those in Vietnam.  The examiner stated that none of the situations that the Veteran experienced were shown to have interfered in any significant way with his overall performance at work, family, and interpersonal relations.  \r\n\r\nIn February 2006, the Veteran underwent mental health screening.  The Veteran reported ambulatory psychiatric treatment with a private psychiatrist from 1980 to 2003.  The Veteran reported that while he sleeps, he hears the enemy coming and while he is awake, he sees in his mind past war incident and disconnects from reality at times.  The Social worker noted that the Veteran met the minimum diagnostic criteria for a mental health condition warranting a psychiatric evaluation.\r\n\r\nIn September 2006, the Veteran underwent VA psychiatric evaluation.  The Veteran was hyper alert, cooperative, restless, and fearful.  He was tearful during interview and his mood was of anxious depression.  Productions were coherent, relevant, and logical, there were no ideas of aggression to self or others, there were visual hallucinations and flash-back episodes related to the Vietnam conflict.  The Veteran complained of insomnia, anhedonia, lack of energy, and loss of libido.  There were no gross cognitive deficits, and judgment and insight were lacking.  Assessment was signs and symptoms compatible with a major depressive episode.  Diagnosis was major depression with psychotic features.\r\n\r\nTranslated records from Dr. J.A.S. indicate that the Veteran was examined by a clinical psychologist in the U.S. in 1970, in the 1980s by Dr. Correa in 1980s.  The Veteran reported that he took medications until 1993 for anxiety.  These records also include a diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn November 2006, the Veteran underwent private psychiatric evaluation with Dr. J.S.  It was noted that the Veteran had been treated by Dr. Correa, that the Veteran complained of reliving the traumatic experience of Vietnam War and that he was treated with medications for anxiety until 1993.  Dr. J.S. rendered an opinion that the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD, that the Veteran complies with medication prescribed, that his condition interferes with his social activities, and that he needs to continue on treatment with medication and professional counseling.  \r\n\r\nA September 2007 VA psychiatric consult report included a diagnosis of dysthymia with PTSD features and rule out PTSD on axis I.    \r\n\r\nIn November 2007, the Veteran was scheduled for another VA PTSD examination.  The examination did not take place as the examiner determined that because there was no evidence of any confirmed stressors, the examination could not be performed at that time.  The VA examiner, Dr. M.M., the same examiner who conducted the November 2001 VA examination, stated that having reviewed the evidence in the case, it was her opinion and suggestion that the case should not be referred for an examination without making sure that the conditions stated for the examination were fully met, specifically the verification of stressors.  The examiner also suggested that the Veteran would be best served if a board of at least two psychiatric examiners, excluding herself for reasons of objectivity, should examine the Veteran.\r\n\r\nIn August 2008, the Veteran was diagnosed by VA physician, Dr. F.R.V., with PTSD.\r\n\r\nVA medical records indicate that the Veteran was hospitalized January 12, 2009 with diagnosis of Chronic PTSD by history.  Letters dated in March 2009 and April 2009, authored by Dr. D.D., PTSD Program Director, verify that the Veteran was diagnosed with and was being treated for combat-related chronic PTSD in the PSTD Residential Rehabilitation Program.  The discharge summary, dated April 20, 2009, indicate a primary diagnosis of chronic PTSD.  The summary noted that the Veteran reported exposure to multiple traumatic events that continued to bother him including incoming fire, ambushes, mines, patrols, witnessing wounded soldiers and civilians and fellow soldiers wounded and killed.  The Veteran reported recurrent nightmares, intrusive memories, sleep difficulties, and hypervigilance upon his return from Vietnam.  The Veteran reported that his symptoms since 2001 had been more frequent and more intense including difficulty sleeping, recurrent trauma-related nightmares, recurrent intrusive memories, trauma-related illusions or hallucinations of voices calling \"incoming,\" emotional detachment from friends and family, decreased interest in social and recreational activities, avoidance of crowds due to feeling tense and hypervigilant, difficulty with concentration and sustaining attention, and irritability.    \r\n\r\nIn a March 2009 letter, Dr. D.D. noted that the Veteran continued to suffer from chronic PTSD and symptoms related to traumatic experiences he was exposed to during his service in the Vietnam War including sad and anxious mood, recurrent nightmares, intrusive memories, concentration problems, sleep problems, hypervigilance, emotional detachment, isolation, decreased interest, and irritability.\r\n\r\nIn April 2009, the Veteran was referred for elective admission to the PTSD RRP by his treating psychiatrist due to persistent symptoms despite compliance with outpatient treatment.  The Veteran reported exposure to multiple traumatic events that continued to bother him including incoming fire, ambushes, mines, patrols, witnessing wounded soldiers and civilians and fellow soldiers wounded and killed.  \r\nVA outpatient records indicate that a June 2009 psychiatry note continued the diagnosis of PTSD and included depression NOS, dysthymic disorder versus major depression, recurrent on axis I.\r\n \r\nIn July 2009, the Veteran underwent a VA examination with two VA psychiatrists, Dr. D.F. and Dr. M.V.  After review of the claims file, interview with the Veteran, and psychiatric examination, the examiners diagnosed depressive disorder NOS and noted that the Veteran did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD and diagnosed depressive disorder NOS.  The examiners noted that there was no evidence of the Veteran persistently reexperiencing the traumatic event or the persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma.  The examiners noted that the Veteran was found with the symptoms of increased arousal and noted that the Veteran reported sleeping difficulties described as early awakening, nightmares regarding military experiences, restlessness and irritability, all since military service.    \r\n\r\nIn November 2009, the Board remanded the case and noted that the July 2009 VA examination did not adequately discuss how the Veteran's reported symptomatology did not establish a PTSD diagnosis comporting with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125 and the adopted criteria of the DSM-IV.  In February 2010, the Veteran's claims file was returned to one of the VA psychiatrists who conducted the July 2009 VA examination.  She reiterated that the Veteran did not fulfill the DSM-IV symptoms criteria for diagnosis of PTSD, that there was no evidence in the Veteran's history of reliving neither the traumatic event nor the avoidant behavior shown by individuals with PTSD, and that the Veteran was found only with the symptoms of increased arousal.  The psychiatrist noted that symptoms of increased arousal are often found in many psychiatric conditions associated with anxiety.  The psychiatrist noted that the Veteran was found with depressive disorder NOS and that he developed this condition after retirement from the Postal Service.  The psychiatrist noted that the Veteran lived a very successful life, occupational and social and that he found himself empty after his retirement.  \r\n\r\nIn May 2010, the VA psychiatrist who provided the February 2010 addendum was asked to clarify her opinions with respect to the etiology of the Veteran's depressive disorder as she had previously provided inconsistent statements regarding the etiology of the Veteran's depressive disorder.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the July 2009 VA examination and subsequent clarifications are inadequate for adjudication.  Initially, the Board notes that the psychiatrists noted that there were no symptoms of re-experiencing the traumatic event.  The DSM-IV criteria indicates persistent reexperiencing includes recurrent and distressing recollections of the event, recurrent distressing dreams of the event, acting or feeling as if the traumatic event were recurring, and intense psychological distress at exposure to or physiological reactivity on exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event.  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that there is a difference of opinion among the medical professionals.  In deciding whether the Veteran's has a current diagnosis of PTSD, it is the responsibility of the Board to weigh the evidence and decide where to give credit and where to withhold the same and, in so doing, accept certain medical opinions over others.  Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 22, 30 (1998).  That responsibility is particularly onerous where medical opinions diverge. At the same time, the Board is mindful that it cannot make its own independent medical determinations and that there must be plausible reasons for favoring one medical opinion over another.  Id.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the Veteran has consistently reported, and reported at the July 2009 VA examination, nightmares regarding military experiences, recurrent intrusive memories, and being unable to watch firework displays.  The July 2009 VA psychiatrists were provided an opportunity to elaborate on why they felt that Veteran showed no symptoms of re-experiencing the traumatic event.  As noted above, VA treatment records noted that the Veteran reported difficulty sleeping, recurrent trauma-related nightmares, recurrent intrusive memories, trauma-related illusions or hallucinations of voices calling \"incoming,\" emotional detachment from friends and family, decreased interest in social and recreational activities, avoidance of crowds due to feeling tense and hypervigilance, difficulty with concentration and sustaining attention, and irritability.  As the July 2009 VA psychiatrists did not provide a complete rationale with respect to their opinion that the Veteran did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD, the Board cannot accept their opinion as competent.          \r\n\r\nThe record reflects verified in-service stressor events related to the Veteran's combat experiences.  As noted above, in-service stressors which have been verified include being fired upon and sharing one foxhole barely large enough for 2 people with 15 people and witnessing soldiers operating a front loader and throwing dead bodies into a ditch.  \r\n\r\nAlthough medical professional disagree as to whether a diagnosis of PTSD is appropriate, the Veteran's treating psychiatric professionals endorse a finding of PTSD associated with the verified combat stressors.  Therefore, resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, a diagnosis of PTSD is established.  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nMILO H.

Sherrard, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active service from May 1966 to May 1968.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) from an October 2006 rating decision by the above Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that denied entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran and his wife provided testimony at an August 2009 Travel Board hearing before the undersigned at the RO.  A transcript is associated with the claims folder.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009), in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that claims for service connection for PTSD should be considered to include claims for service connection for all psychiatric disabilities, the Board remanded the claim for a VA examination to determine whether there were any additional psychiatric diagnoses that could be related to active service.  The development requested by the Board in its October 2009 decision has been completed, as discussed below, and the claim is now appropriate for appellate review.    \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that, subsequent to its October 2009 remand, service connection for PTSD was granted in a December 2010 rating decision, and thus, the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD is not before us.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe competent and probative medical evidence of record preponderates against a finding that the Veteran's depression and dementia are related to active service; nor was a psychotic disorder manifested within one year after her separation from active service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nA mental disorder other than PTSD, including depression and dementia, was not incurred in or aggravated by active service, nor may it be presumed to have been so incurred.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1137, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107(b) (West 2002 & Supp. 2010); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.384 (2010). \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  Duty to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) enhanced VA's duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating their claims for VA benefits, as codified in pertinent part at 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2010); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.326(a) (2010).\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application for benefits, VA is required to notify the claimant and his representative of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  Proper notice from VA must inform the claimant of any information and evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide, in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1) (2010).  This notice must be provided prior to an initial unfavorable decision on a claim by the RO.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004).  In addition, the decision of the Court in Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006) requires more extensive notice in claims for compensation, e.g., as to potential downstream issues such as disability rating and effective date.  \r\n\r\nIf complete notice is not provided until after the initial adjudication, such a timing error can be cured by subsequent legally adequate VCAA notice, followed by readjudication of the claim, as in a Statement of the Case (SOC) or Supplemental SOC (SSOC).  Moreover, where there is an uncured timing defect in the notice, subsequent action by the RO which provides the claimant a meaningful opportunity to participate in the processing of the claim can prevent any such defect from being prejudicial.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 499 F.3d 1317, 1323-24 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Prickett v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 370, 376 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has held that an error in VCAA notice should not be presumed prejudicial, and that the burden of showing harmful error rests with the party raising the issue, to be determined on a case-by-case basis.  Shinseki v. Sanders, 129 S. Ct. 1696 (2009).  In this case, the appellant has not demonstrated any prejudicial or harmful error in VCAA notice, nor, as discussed below, has the Board identified any.\r\n\r\nIn April 2006, VA sent the Veteran a letter informing him of the types of evidence needed to substantiate his claim and its duty to assist him in substantiating his claim under the VCAA.  The letter informed the Veteran that VA would assist him in obtaining evidence necessary to support his claim, such as medical records, employment records, or records from other Federal agencies.  He was advised that it is his responsibility to provide or identify, and furnish authorization where necessary for the RO to obtain, any supportive evidence pertinent to his claim.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1).  Although no longer required, the appellant was also asked to submit evidence and/or information in his possession to the RO.  In addition, the letter described how VA calculates disability ratings and effective dates.  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the contents of the April 2006 letter satisfied the requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) regarding VA's duty to notify and assist, including the requirements set forth by the Court in Dingess, supra.  In addition, the January 2011 SSOC explained the basis for the RO's action and provided him with an additional 60-day period to submit more evidence. \r\n\r\nThus, it appears that all obtainable evidence identified by the Veteran relative to his claim has been obtained and associated with the claims file, and that neither he nor his representative has identified any other pertinent evidence, not already of record, which would need to be obtained for a fair disposition of this appeal.  \r\n\r\nIt is the Board's conclusion that the Veteran has been provided with every opportunity to submit evidence and argument in support of his claim, and to respond to VA notices.  \r\n\r\nWith regard to VA's duty to assist, VA obtained the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) and treatment records from the Huntington VA Medical Center (VAMC).  As mentioned above, in an October 2009 decision, the Board remanded the claim for further development.  Specifically, the Board stated that a VA examination was needed to obtain a medical opinion regarding whether there were any psychiatric diagnoses other than PTSD and if so, whether a nexus existed between those diagnoses and active service.     \r\n\r\nFollowing the Board's remand, a VA examination was conducted in March 2010 that included a thorough psychiatric evaluation and an opinion regarding whether his other psychiatric diagnoses were related to service.  Thus, it appears that all development requested by this Board in its October 2009 remand has been completed to the extent possible, and no additional development is required.   \r\n\r\nAccordingly, we find that VA has satisfied its duty to assist the Veteran in apprising him as to the evidence needed, and in obtaining evidence pertinent to his claim under the VCAA.  Therefore, no useful purpose would be served in remanding this matter for yet more development.  Such a remand would result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA, with no additional benefits flowing to the Veteran.  The Court of Appeals for Veteran Claims has held that such remands are to be avoided.  See Soyini v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 (1991); Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).\r\n\r\nII.  Service Connection\r\n\r\nA.  Applicable Law\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability which is the result of disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 2002 & Supp. 2010); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a) (2010).\r\n\r\nWhere there is a chronic disease shown as such in service or within the presumptive period under 38 C.F.R. � 3.307 so as to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.  This rule does not mean that any manifestation in service will permit service connection.  To show chronic disease in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word \"chronic.\"  When the disease identity is established, there is no requirement of evidentiary showing of continuity.  When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, then a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support the claim.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b).\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disease that is diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1113(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held that, in order to prevail on the issue of service connection, there must be:  (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury.  Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the law provides that, where a veteran served ninety days or more of active military service, and certain chronic diseases, such as psychoses (defined in 38 C.F.R. � 3.384), become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year after the date of separation from such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.307, 3.309(a).  While the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time.  Id.\r\n\r\nIt is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record on appeal.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 7104(a).  When there is an approximate balance in the evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102.\r\n\r\nIn Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that an appellant need only demonstrate that there is an \"approximate balance of positive and negative evidence\" in order to prevail.  The Court has also stated, \"It is clear that to deny a claim on its merits, the evidence must preponderate against the claim.\"  Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996), citing Gilbert.\r\n\r\nB.  Facts and Analysis\r\n \r\nIn a March 2011 Written Argument, the Veteran's representative contends that the Veteran's currently diagnosed dementia and major depression are related to active service.  \r\n\r\nHis STRs are negative for any manifestations of mental health or cognitive disorders.  Both the July 1965 induction and April 1968 separation examinations reports reflect a normal psychiatric evaluation.\r\n\r\nFollowing separation from service, he was diagnosed with depression and memory loss at the Huntington VAMC in December 2005.  In this regard, the Board notes that evidence of a prolonged period without medical complaint or treatment, and the amount of time which has elapsed since military service, can be considered as evidence against the claim.  Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  He refused antidepressant medication at the time.  He was referred to neurology for additional evaluation of his memory loss.  \r\n\r\nAt a subsequent mental health evaluation in January 2006, the examining social worker assessed \"rule out\" dementia; a diagnosis of dementia was subsequently confirmed as in March 2006, and later clarified to be parieto-temporal dementia.  \r\n\r\nA November 2006 treatment note indicates MRI scans of the brain and an electroencephalography were normal.  \r\n\r\nIn January 2008, the Veteran said, with regard to his depression, that he had good days and bad days, and that bad days were usually related to his family.  His dementia was an issue for his family.  \r\n\r\nIn January 2009, the Veteran reported an increase in both his depression and dementia.  He continued treatment for both conditions at the VAMC, and none of his providers offered an opinion as to the etiology of the disorders.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2010.  A collateral interview of his wife was conducted as part of the examination, and the examiner reviewed the claims file.  When asked what his current mental health concerns were, the Veteran said he was most bothered by his loss of cognitive functioning and inability to work.  He expressed feelings of worthlessness and guilt related to his cognitive problems, and hopelessness secondary to his memory problems.  The examiner stated that the symptoms of depression, including sadness, anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, and indecisiveness, had increased as his dementia progressed, and were at a moderate level of severity.  Moreover, his depressive symptoms were not assessed as associated with his PTSD symptoms, but rather were associated with his declining cognitive functioning.  The examiner assessed major depressive disorder, in partial remission, and dementia not otherwise specified.  Although his PTSD symptoms caused moderate psychological distress, the examiner opined that his dementia was the source of his depression and the majority of his functional impairments, noting that the Veteran and his wife quite clearly stated that his depressive symptoms began in reaction to his cognitive decline.  Moreover, the examiner opined that both the dementia and depression were not related to active military service.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a grant of service connection for a mental disorder other than PTSD, to include depression and dementia.  \r\n\r\nFirst, the Board finds that the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. �� 3.307, 3.309(a) as to y psychotic disorder do not apply here.  The first diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder was documented more than a year after the Veteran's separation from service, and there is no record of complaints during the first post-service year.  Moreover, depression and dementia do not meet the definition of a psychotic disorder as defined in 38 C.F.R. � 3.384.  \r\n\r\nNext, continuity of the disorder has not been established by the evidence.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to give evidence about what he experienced; for example, he is competent to discuss his current sadness, memory problems, and other experienced symptoms.  See, e.g., Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994).  Moreover, the Federal Circuit Court has held that in certain situations, lay evidence can even be sufficient with respect to establishing medical matters such as a diagnosis.  Specifically, in Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007), the Federal Circuit commented that competence to establish a diagnosis of a condition can exist when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  See also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (2009) (noting that a layperson may comment on lay-observable symptoms).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held that, when a condition may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features, the presence of the disorder is not a determination \"medical in nature\" and is capable of lay observation.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  Furthermore, lay evidence concerning continuity of symptoms after service, if credible, is ultimately competent, regardless of the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  However, the resolution of issues which involve medical knowledge, such as the diagnosis of a disability and the determination of medical etiology, requires professional evidence.  See Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 495 (1992).  \r\n\r\nIn the present case, the Veteran's sadness, memory problems, and other symptoms are found to be capable of lay observation, and thus his statements constitute competent evidence.  The Board must now consider the credibility of such evidence.  The Veteran's service records show no evidence of any mental disorder or dementia in active service.  Following service, there was no documentation of complaints or treatment for depression or dementia until 2005, 37 years after his separation from service.  While he appears to be sincere in his belief as to service connection, in light of these factors, the Veteran's current statements to the effect that he has experienced continuous symptomatology since active service, while competent, are not deemed to be credible.  Therefore, the absence of documented complaints or treatment for nearly four decades following his military discharge is more probative than his current recollection as to symptoms experienced in the distant past.  See Curry v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 59 (1994).  Moreover, there are no competent opinions relating either the depression or dementia to military service.  Indeed, the only competent nexus opinion is unfavorable.  Accordingly, continuity of symptomatology is not established by either the competent evidence or the Veteran's own statements.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the evidence of record is against a grant of service connection for a mental disorder other than PTSD, to include depression and dementia.  As the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 54-56 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a mental disorder other than PTSD, to include depression and dementia, is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________\r\nANDREW J.

Kreindler, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from March 1974 to March 1977.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2004 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that denied service connection for PTSD.  A notice of disagreement was filed in March 2004, a statement of the case was issued in February 2005, and a substantive appeal was received in April 2005.  The Veteran testified at a Board hearing in March 2011; the transcript is of record.  \r\n\r\nIn February 2011, the Veteran filed a claim of service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  This is referred to the RO for appropriate action.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the Veteran if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nAn October 2000 VA treatment record reflects that the Veteran had sought mental health treatment at the Phoenix VA Medical Center (VAMC) since 1984.  At the Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he sought mental health treatment at the Denver, Colorado VAMC or the Phoenix VAMC in 1980 or thereafter.  The evidence of record contains VA inpatient and outpatient treatment records from March 25, 1996; however, there are no records on file prior to this period.  The Veteran's treatment records for the period January 1, 1980, to March 24, 1996, from the Denver and Phoenix VAMC's, should be associated with the claims folder.  See Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992).  While on remand, updated treatment records should be obtained from the Phoenix VAMC for the period January 19, 2011 to the present.  See id.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD, the Board notes that new regulations have been implemented with regard to stressor determinations for PTSD.  Per the new regulations, service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a); an in-service stressor consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of service (satisfactorily established by lay testimony) that has been medically related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity by a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or one contracted with by VA; and the Veteran's PTSD symptoms have been medically related to the in-service stressor by a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or one contracted with by VA.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) (2010); 75 Fed. Reg. 39843 - 39852 (July 13, 2010).\r\n\r\nIf a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of [PTSD] and that the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  For purposes of this paragraph, \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" means that a Veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the Veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the Veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3); 75 Fed. Reg. 39843 - 39852 (July 13, 2010).  Since the Veteran was not stationed in an area where hostile military or terrorist activity would normally take place, it is not clear that the regulatory change would relate to him.  \r\n\r\n The Veteran has submitted statements and has testified that he served as a combat engineer building bridges and retrieving World War II mines during his service in Germany.  The Veteran testified that retrieving the land mines could be nerve-wracking.  The Veteran testified that his unit was called out on \"alerts\" and he would be in the \"field\" for weeks at a time in Germany and along the Czechoslovakian border.  He has stated that he began to drink heavily and use drugs during his period of active service.  He witnessed soldiers being injured in accidents and witnessed a soldier attempting suicide.  The RO/AMC should notify the Veteran of the regulation changes and ensure that the Veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD is readjudicated under the amendments.  \r\n\r\nIn Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009), the Court of Apeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that a claim of service connection for PTSD was not limited to an adjudication of PTSD alone in light of other diagnoses of mental illness in the record.  The Court noted that a layperson is not competent to diagnose a psychiatric disorder; therefore, any and all mental disorders eventually diagnosed during the course of a claim should be considered, even though the Veteran did not file a written claim for that disorder.\r\n\r\nThe facts of the instant case are similar to those in Clemons.  In this matter, the RO has denied entitlement to service connection for PTSD on the basis that claimed stressors have not been corroborated.  The medical evidence, however, reflects diagnoses of dysthymia, bipolar affective disorder, and major depression.  In light of the Court's holding in Clemons, the Board finds that the Veteran should be scheduled for a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of all of his psychiatric symptomatology, including dysthymia, bipolar affective disorder, and major depression.\r\n\r\nThe RO should also ensure that the Veteran receives proper notice pursuant to the VCAA with regard to entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, other than PTSD.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, and 5107; 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b); Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 486 (2006).  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  Request treatment records from the Denver VAMC and Phoenix VAMC for the period January 1, 1980, to March 24, 1996, and obtain updated treatment records from the Phoenix VAMC for the period January 19, 2011.  If such efforts prove unsuccessful, documentation to that effect should be added to the claims folder.\r\n\r\n2.  Schedule the Veteran for a comprehensive VA psychiatric examination to determine the diagnoses of all psychiatric disorders that are present.  The claims folder and a copy of this remand must be provided to the examiner prior to the examination.  The examiner should determine the diagnoses of any currently manifested psychiatric disorder(s).  The diagnosis(es) must be based on examination findings, all available medical records, complete review of comprehensive testing for PTSD, and any special testing deemed appropriate.  A multiaxial evaluation based on the current DSM-IV diagnostic criteria is required.  \r\n\r\na) The examiner should determine whether the Veteran currently suffers from PTSD related to his fear of hostile military or terrorist activity while on active duty, and whether it is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD.  For purposes of this paragraph, \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" means that a Veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the Veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming  artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the Veteran's response to the  event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror. \r\n\r\nb)  For any other psychiatric diagnosis, the examiner is requested to render an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., a likelihood of 50 percent or more) that any currently diagnosed psychiatric disorder is a result of service or any incident therein.\r\n\r\nAll opinions and conclusions expressed must be supported by a complete rationale in a report.  The examiner should reconcile any opinion with the service treatment records, service personnel records, and post-service diagnoses.\r\n\r\n3.  After completion of the above, review the expanded record and readjudicate entitlement to service connection for PTSD, to include under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) (2010) and 75 Fed. Reg. 39843 - 39852 (July 13, 2010), and adjudicate entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability.  If any of the benefits sought are not granted in full, the Veteran should be furnished an appropriate supplemental statement of the case and be afforded an opportunity to respond.  Thereafter, the case should be returned to the Board for appellate review.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran and his representative have the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2010).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nTHOMAS J.

I. Velez, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from May 1962 to May 1964.\r\n\r\nThis matter came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) on appeal from a September 2007 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Waco, Texas.\r\n\r\nIn March 2010, the Veteran testified before the undersigned at a videoconference hearing.  A transcript of the hearing has been associated with the claim file.  \r\n\r\nIn March 2010, the Board remanded the claim for further development.  The requested development has been completed and the claim is ready for appellate review.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  PTSD in accordance with DSM-IV criteria is not shown.\r\n\r\n2.  An acquired psychiatric disorder was not manifest in service and is not related to service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\n1.  PTSD, was not incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 4.125(a) (2010).\r\n\r\n2.  An acquired psychiatric disorder was not incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1131, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107, (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (2010).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nVCAA\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (Nov. 9, 2000) (codified at 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2010)) redefined VA's duty to assist the Veteran in the development of a claim.  VA regulations for the implementation of the VCAA were codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2010).\r\n\r\nUnder the VCAA, VA must inform the claimant of any information and evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide.  Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 120-21 (2004); 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b).\r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has also held that the VCAA notice requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) apply to all five elements of a service connection claim. Those five elements include: 1) Veteran status; 2) existence of a disability; 3) a connection between the Veteran's service and the disability; 4) degree of disability; and 5) effective date of the disability.  Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).\r\n\r\nIn a December 2006 pre-rating letter, the RO notified the Veteran of the evidence needed to substantiate a claim for service connection for PTSD.  This letter also satisfied the second and third elements of the duty to notify by delineating the evidence VA would assist in obtaining and the evidence it was expected that he would provide.  Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183, 186- 87 (2002); Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).  The Veteran was notified of all other elements of the Dingess notice, including the disability-rating and effective-date elements of his claim, in the December 2006 letter.\r\n\r\nThe VCAA also requires VA to make reasonable efforts to help a claimant obtain evidence necessary to substantiate his claim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A; 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c), (d).  This \"duty to assist\" contemplates that VA will help a claimant obtain records relevant to his claim, whether or not the records are in Federal custody, and that VA will provide a medical examination or obtain an opinion when necessary to make a decision on the claim.  38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(4).\r\n\r\nIn this case, VA obtained the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) and all of the identified post-service private and VA treatment records, as well as the records of the Social Security Administration's (SSA's) disability determination.  \r\nIn addition, the Veteran was afforded a February 2010 VA psychiatric examination.  This examination was adequate because, as discussed below, the examiner's opinion that she could not render a diagnosis of PTSD was based on consideration of the Veteran's prior medical history and contained a detailed explanation of the reasons for her conclusion.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet.App. 120, 123 (2007); see also Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Board notes that Social Security Administration (SSA) records have not been associated with the claim file.  However, in a reply of June 2010 to a request for SSA records, the SSA noted that the records were not available as they had been destroyed.  As such, there are no outstanding SSA records to be obtained.   \r\n\r\nMoreover, during the Board hearing, the Veteran's representative and the undersigned asked the Veteran questions that indicated to the Veteran that he should submit any potentially relevant evidence in his possession in support of his claim.  This action supplements VA's compliance with the VCAA and satisfies 38 C.F.R. � 3.103 (2010).  See Bryant v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 488 (2010).\r\n\r\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Board finds that VA has complied with the VCAA's notification and assistance requirements. The applications to reopen and the claim for service connection for PTSD are thus ready to be considered on the merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal Criteria and Analysis\r\n\r\nCompensation may be awarded for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1131.  Service connection basically means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303.\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).  However, \"[a] determination of service connection requires a finding of the existence of a current disability and a determination of a relationship between that disability and an injury or disease incurred in service.\"  Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 309, 314 (1993).\r\n\r\nPsychosis shall be considered to have been incurred in or aggravated by service although not otherwise established during the period of service if manifested to a compensable degree within one year following service in a period of war or following peacetime service on or after January 1, 1947.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.307(a) (3), 3.309(a).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with VA regulations; a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d) (pertaining to combat veterans). See also Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, 289 (1994).\r\n\r\nA claim for service connection for a mental disability may encompass claims for service connection of any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by several factors, including the claimant's description of the claim, the symptoms the claimant describes and the information the claimant submits or that the Secretary obtains in support of the claim.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009).  Accordingly, in reviewing the immediate case the Board has taken an expansive view of the psychiatric claim.\r\n\r\nWhen all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the appellant prevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against a claim, in which case, the claim is denied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\nAt the outset, the Board notes that the Veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy.  In this regard, the Board notes that while the Veteran testified at the March 2010 hearing that he had fought with the enemy in Korea, the record shows that the Veteran did not serve during a period of War and his DD 214 does not show he has been awarded any combat related medals.  Any inferred assertion of combat or combat like activity is not credible.  However, he has been credible when he reports no combat.  Therefore, the combat provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154 (West 2002) are not applicable.\r\n\r\nService treatment records are completely silent for any treatment of or diagnosis of a psychiatric disability.  A separation physical of March 1964 shows all systems to be normal.  In the accompanying Report of Medical History, the Veteran denied any depression or excessive worry, loss of memory or amnesia, nervous trouble of any sort, frequent trouble sleeping or, frequent or terrifying nightmares.  \r\n\r\nA VA mental health intake report of January 1999 notes the Veteran reported temper and violence problems since service.  He reported that he has been depressed and has had suicidal thoughts in the past but none a the present.  He denied homicidal thoughts.  He stated all started while stationed in Korea where he had many bad experiences but no combat.  He reported frequent disturbing memories and dreams about his experiences.  He stated he was depressed because he has no job.  He prefers to be a loner.  He has no hallucinations, some paranoia, problems with concentration, but memory is OK.  The assessment included depression.  \r\n\r\nVA treatment records of November 1999 note a diagnosis of questionable PTSD.  An SSA decision of February 2000 notes the Veteran had a diagnosis of alcohol induced mood disorder secondary to his chronic pain.  \r\n\r\nVA outpatient treatment records of May 2001 note diagnoses of PTSD and depression.  In June 2001 he was noted to have a diagnosis of alcohol dependence.  \r\n\r\nA June 2001 letter from the Veteran's private physician, Dr. G. Hernandez, states that the Veteran has been his patient since August 2000 and he has diagnoses of depressive disorder NOS and alcohol dependence.  \r\n\r\nA VA mental status examination of July 2003 notes a diagnosis of alcohol dependence and rule out alcohol induced mood disorder versus depression NOS.  \r\n\r\nA VA dermatologist consultation report notes the Veteran has PTSD.  \r\n\r\nVA outpatient treatment records of April 2004 note a diagnosis of mood disorder due to alcohol dependence.  In July 2006 he was noted to have a depressive mood.  Records dated later that same month show diagnoses of alcohol dependence and depression NOS.  \r\n\r\nIn a January 2007 VA Form 21-0781 Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connection for PTSD, the Veteran noted three stressors: a speech by his General in Korea where he stated that all soldiers should take care of themselves or otherwise they would not return to the states alive; stress caused when they were told to be ready to go to Cuba; and the cease fire of the Cold War.  \r\n\r\nAt the video conference hearing of March 2010, the Veteran testified that he had not been diagnosed with PTSD but that he had been told by physicians that he had a problem with trauma and depression.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA examination in July 2010.  At the time, the Veteran denied any symptoms present during the past year and denied having any current treatment for a mental disorder.  He denied any alcohol use.  Physical examination showed he was appropriately dressed, psychomotor activity and speech were unremarkable, and he was cooperative.  Affect was normal.  Mood was good.  Attention was intact.  He was oriented to person, time and place.  He denied any combat experience.  He reported he remains in his first and only marriage of 45 years.  He has 4 adult children and 5 grandchildren.  He maintains regular contact with his children.  He reported he enjoys watching television and working on his small farm.  He denied any suicide attempts, violence or assaultiveness.  Thought process and content was noted to be unremarkable.  He denied any delusions.  He could understand the outcome of his behavior and could partially understand he has a problem.  He denied any sleep impairment or hallucinations.  He had no inappropriate behavior, no ritualistic or obsessive behavior, panic attacks, homicidal thoughts or suicidal thoughts.  Impulse control was poor.  It was noted the veteran was convicted of abuse 12 years prior.  He could maintain minimum personal hygiene and had no problems with activities of daily living.  Remote, recent and immediate memory were normal.  The examiner opined that at the present time, the Veteran's symptoms fail to meet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD.  He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence.  The examiner opined that after a careful review of the claim file, VA mental health records an current clinical interview of the Veteran, he fails to meet the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD.  At the present time, the only psychiatric diagnosis provided is alcohol dependence.  The examiner further noted that given the Veteran's long history of alcohol dependence, and reluctance to seek and accept treatment for alcohol dependence, his reported PTSD-like symptoms may be related to psychosocial difficulties resulting from excessive alcohol use.  Finally, she stated that at the present time, there do not appear to be any psychiatric conditions related to his active duty military career.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has claimed service connection for PTSD and, more generally, for a psychiatric disorder.  There are particular requirements for establishing PTSD in 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), which take precedence over the general requirements for establishing service connection in 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  See Arzio v. Shinseki, 602 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  \r\n\r\nWeighing the evidence of record, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and depressive disorder.\r\n\r\nAs noted, service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a), a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) requires that a diagnosis of a mental disorder conform to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).\r\n\r\nA necessary element for establishing any service connection claim, including one for PTSD, is the existence of a current disability.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (1997) (holding that section 1110 of the statute requires the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes); see also Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 144 (1992).  The presence of a disability at the time of filing of a claim or during its pendency warrants a finding that the current disability requirement has been met, even if the disability resolves prior to the Board's adjudication of the claim.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  The claim for service connection for PTSD must be denied because the preponderance of the evidence reflects that the Veteran does not have PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a), and has not had this disability at any time.\r\n\r\nThe Board recognizes that there are several VA outpatient treatment records noting PTSD.  However, none of those records establish a basis for the conclusion that was reached.  The notations are remarkable for an incredible lack of detail to include the symptoms and stressors to support a diagnosis.  Significantly, the July 2010 VA examiner specifically found that the Veteran's symptoms do not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD.  She further provided an explanation for the PTSD-like symptoms reported by the Veteran as being a consequence of his alcohol dependence which has been ongoing for many years.  The Board finds the opinion of the July 2010 examiner to be reliable and adequate.  It was provided after a review of the claim file with related medical treatment records, an examination of the Veteran, accurate findings and a rationale for the opinion.  Without a diagnosis of PTSD, service connection must be denied.  \r\n\r\nRegarding other psychiatric diagnoses, the Board notes that the record shows diagnoses of depressive disorder NOS and mood disorder.  The evidence of record shows no psychiatric abnormality in service or within the initial post separation year.  In addition, there is no competent and reliable nexus to service.  Indeed, his depression and mood disorder have been related to his alocohol dependence as well as his unemployment.  \r\n\r\nThe Board must also consider the Veteran's lay statements indicating that he has depression due to military service.  The Veteran is competent to testify as to his observations.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  In addition, lay witnesses may, in some circumstances, opine on questions of diagnosis and etiology.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (Board's categorical statement that \"a valid medical opinion\" was required to establish nexus, and that a layperson was \"not competent\" to provide testimony as to nexus because she was a layperson, conflicts with Jandreau).  However, unlike disabilities which may be observable as to both their incurrence and their cause, such as a dislocated shoulder, the cause of a psychiatric disability is not readily apparent to lay observation, and the Court has held that psychiatric diagnoses are generally the province of medical professionals.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 6 (2009) (\"It is generally the province of medical professionals to diagnose or label a mental condition, not the claimant\").  See also Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007) (unlike varicose veins or a dislocated shoulder, rheumatic fever is not a condition capable of lay diagnosis).  Moreover, the Veteran's general lay assertions are outweighed by the specific and reasoned conclusion of the July 2010 VA examiner and other physicians who have found the Veteran does not have a psychiatric disorder related to service.  See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304 (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning; threshold considerations include the qualifications of the person opining).\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that his report in January 1999 of a temper and violence problem since service.  Also, there was a report of depression and suicidal thoughts while stationed in Korea.  Clearly, he is competent to report his emotions and when they started.  However, the report of in-service chronicity and continuity are not credible.  The separation examination disclosed that he was normal and that he denied pertinent pathology.  We conclude that the in-service observation of a professional and his contemporaneous denial of pathology is far more probative than a statement advanced decades after the claimed event.  At a minimum, he is an inconsistent historian.   \r\n\r\nFinally, the Board acknowledges the diagnoses of alcohol dependence and mood disorder associated with alcohol dependence.  In that regard, the Board notes that the law provides that no compensation shall be paid if a disability is the result of a Veteran's own willful misconduct, the abuse of alcohol or drugs.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 105, 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.1(n), 3.301 (2009); see also VAOPGPREC 2-97 (January 16, 1997).  The law also precludes compensation for primary alcohol abuse disabilities, and secondary disabilities that result from primary alcohol abuse.  Allen v. Principi, 237 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  Thus, in order for service connection to be granted for alcohol dependence, it must be established as secondary to, or a component of, a service-connected disability.   However, here there is no dispute as to the essential facts and alcohol dependence has not been related to a service-connected disability, and a direct service connection theory of entitlement is legally precluded.  Moreover, as the diagnosed mood disorder has been associated to the alcohol dependence, service connection is not warranted for the same.  \r\n\r\nAs the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder to include PTSD and depression must therefore be denied.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102; see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  As the evidence is not in equipoise, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); Gilbert supra.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nH.

Ganz, Associate Counsel \r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active military service from June 1982 to May 1986.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a December 2008 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Reno, Nevada, which, in pertinent part, denied entitlement to service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD has been re-characterized pursuant to Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) and medical evidence of record indicating diagnoses of bipolar disorder and depression.  A July 2010 rating decision denied service connection for bipolar disorder, and the Veteran has claimed that her bipolar disorder, along with all of her mental disorders are related to claimed in-service sexual harassment and assault.  Thus, given Clemons, supra., and the Veteran's contentions, the Board finds that it is appropriate to characterize the Veteran's current claim as one of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include bipolar disorder, depression, and PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran seeks service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include bipolar disorder, depression, and PTSD.  She contends that while she worked in a recruiting office under the delayed entry program her supervisor kept her late after everyone else went home with the express purpose of having sexual relations with her.  She also contends that while she deployed in the Philippines she worked in the men's barracks and assigned rooms.  Her supervising petty officer, J.P., would grope her and make lewd sexual advances.  This continued until she threatened him at which point he wrote her up for insubordination.  \r\n\r\nThe Board recognizes that the present case falls within the category of situations, to include allegations of personal assault, in which it is not unusual for there to be an absence of service records documenting the events of which the Veteran alleges.  See, e.g., Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272, 281 (1999).  The amendments to 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(4) noted above reflect a recognition that service records may not contain evidence of personal assault, and that alternative sources may provide credible evidence of an in-service stressor premised on personal assault including, but are not limited to: records from law enforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases, and statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy.  See YR v. West, 11 Vet. App. 393, 399 (1998); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(4).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's personnel records are of record, including a microfiche of them.  However, the paper document version of her personnel records are largely illegible due to their being printed too lightly on paper.  To ensure VA has not met its duty to assist the appellant in developing the evidence in support of her claim pursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A, this case must be remanded so that a legible version of her personnel records can be obtained and reviewed by the Board prior to the adjudication of her claim.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the competent evidence of record indicates that the Veteran has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression and that post service VA treatment records indicate that she has reported that during service she was verbally harassed in a sexual manner and cornered against the wall and then written up when she confronted her sexual harasser.  \r\n\r\nVA's duty to assist a claimant includes providing a medical examination or obtaining a medical opinion when necessary to decide the claim.  38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(4).\r\n\r\nGiven that the Veteran currently has an acquired psychiatric disability and claims she was sexually harassed and assaulted during service, a VA examination should be conducted to determine whether the Veteran has an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include bipolar disorder, depression, or PTSD that is related to service, including sexual harassment or sexual assault during service.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(4).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran is hereby notified that it is her responsibility to report for the examination and to cooperate in the development of the case, and that the consequences of failure to report for a VA examination without good cause may include denial of the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. �� 3.158 and 3.655.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Take all necessary steps to obtain and associate with the claim file a legible copy of the Veteran's personnel records.  \r\n\r\n2.  Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of any current acquired psychiatric disabilities.  All necessary testing should be conducted and the examiner is to elicit a history of the Veteran's claimed sexual harassment and assault during service.  As to any current psychiatric disability indentified, the examiner is to provide an opinion as to whether it is as likely as not related to service, including a sexual assault or harassment during service.\r\n\r\nAny diagnosis of PTSD must be in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV).\r\n\r\nThe claim folder must be made available to the examiner for review in conjunction with the examination.  A detailed rationale for all medical opinions must be provided.  \r\n\r\nIf the examiner feels that the requested opinion cannot be rendered without resorting to speculation, the examiner should state whether the need to speculate is caused by a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (i.e. no one could respond given medical science and the known facts) or by a deficiency in the record or the examiner (i.e. additional facts are required, or the examiner does not have the needed knowledge or training).\r\n\r\n3.  Thereafter, if necessary, any additional development deemed appropriate should be accomplished.  The claim should then be readjudicated.  If the claim remains denied, issue a supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) containing notice of all relevant actions taken on the claim, to include a summary of the evidence and applicable law and regulations considered pertinent to the issue currently on appeal, and allow an appropriate period of time for response.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Cherry, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was in the United States Navy from August 1976 to March 1984 but with only one year, four months, and 12 days of active service due to unauthorized absences from October 28, 1977 to April 30, 1978 and from May 3, 1978 to January 9, 1984.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2008 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Nashville, Tennessee, Regional Office (RO) that denied the appellant's claim for depression.  Bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder have also been diagnosed.  During the pendency of this appeal, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for PTSD, which was denied in a March 2009 rating decision by the Nashville, Tennessee, RO.  The Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD, as well as claims of entitlement to service connection for bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder, has been incorporated into his current appeal.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App 1 (2009).\r\n\r\nIn June 2010, the Board remanded the claim for further development.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe 1984 hospitalization records obtained pursuant to the Board's remand contain a medical board report revealing diagnoses of atypical psychosis and dysthymic disorder that existed prior to entrance and that were not aggravated by service.  The Veteran's entrance examination is not of record.  A March 1984 service personnel record shows that the United States Navy was unable to locate the appellant's health and dental records due to his lengthy periods of unauthorized absence.  In light of the above, a VA examination with a medical opinion is necessary for the adjudication of this claim.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran is receiving Social Security disability benefits.  The Social Security Administration records are potentially relevant to his claim and must be obtained.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Veteran has identified various providers of psychiatric treatment and should be afforded one last opportunity to submit individual authorizations of release for those providers.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  The AMC should ask the Veteran to identify any treatment since October 2010.  The AMC should obtain all records from Greenleaf where he was treated for alcoholism in 1992 and/or 1993, from CRT, the Athens Regional Center Emergency Room for treatment in early January 2007, from Dr. Sultan dated from 1994 to 2006, and from any other identified providers.  All records obtained should be associated with the appellant's claims file.\r\n\r\n2.  The RO should contact the Social Security Administration in order to obtain, if available, any records pertaining to the Veteran's disability benefits from that agency. Any such records so obtained should be associated with the appellant's VA claims folder. \r\n\r\n3.  Thereafter, upon completion of the foregoing development, schedule the Veteran for a psychiatric examination, to determine the nature and etiology of any current acquired psychiatric disorder.  Any indicated tests must be accomplished.  The claims folder and a copy of this REMAND must be made available to the examiner.  The examiner must opine whether the Veteran's current psychiatric disorder clearly and unmistakably preexisted active service, and whether it is also clear and unmistakable that there was no increase in disability during service (during the active service, not the unauthorized absences) or that any increase in disability was due to the natural progress of the preexisting psychiatric disorder.  If the examiner concludes that the disorder did not exist prior to service, an opinion should be rendered as to whether the disorder had onset during active service or instead had onset during a period of unauthorized absence.  A complete rationale for any opinion offered must be provided.\r\n\r\n4.  The Veteran is to be notified that it is his responsibility to report for any scheduled examination and to cooperate in the development of the claim.  The consequences for failure to report for a VA examination without good cause may include denial of the claim.  38 C.F.R. �� 3.158, 3.655 (2011).  \r\n \r\n5.  After the development requested, the RO should review the examination report to ensure that it is in complete compliance with the directives of this REMAND.  If the report is deficient in any manner, the AMC must implement corrective procedures at once\r\n\r\n6.  Thereafter, the AMC must readjudicate the issue on appeal.  If the benefit sought on appeal is not granted, the Veteran and his representative must be furnished with a supplemental statement of the case and afforded an opportunity to respond before the file is returned to the Board for further appellate consideration. \r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.

Vavrina, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from June 1973 to March 1987.  \r\n\r\nThe matter came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) initially on appeal from a May 2002 rating decision issued in June 2002 in which the RO, in part, denied the Veteran's service-connection claim for PTSD.  Even though the Veteran's initial claim was for service connection for PTSD, the issue on appeal has been recharacterized as described on the title page as a claim for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, claimed as PTSD, since he has been assessed with PTSD, major depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009). \r\n\r\nThe case previously was remanded in September 2005 and May 2009.  It is now before the Board for further appellate consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD due to a verified stressor incurred in service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was incurred during the Veteran's active duty service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.326(a), 4.125 (2011).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nApplicable law provides that service connection will be granted if it is shown that the Veteran suffers from disability resulting from an injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty, in the active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  That an injury occurred in service alone is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury.  If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran is seeking service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, claimed as PTSD.  Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a), a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  If the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) require that a diagnosis of a mental disorder conform to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). \r\n\r\nEffective July 13, 2010, VA amended its adjudication regulations governing service connection for PTSD by liberalizing, in certain circumstances, the evidentiary standard for establishing the required in-service stressor.  Specifically, the final rule amends 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) by redesignating current paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(4) as paragraphs (f)(4) and (f)(5), respectively, and by adding a new paragraph (f)(3) that reads as follows: \r\n\r\n(f)(3) If a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to the veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of [PTSD] and that the veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  For purposes of this paragraph, \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" means that a veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror. \r\n\r\nThe Board remanded the case in September 2005 and May 2009 in order for the RO to attempt to verify the Veteran's alleged stressors and to schedule a VA examination if any of the stressors were verified.\r\n\r\nAs noted in the Board's September 2005 remand, the Veteran claimed a number of stressors indicating that he was in fear of bodily harm or death for himself or others.  Under the new criteria, the Veteran's claimed stressors effectively include a fear for his life that is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of his active duty service as detailed in his service personnel records.  In turn, his lay testimony alone may also establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  Further, as the September 2005 and May 2009 remands were issued prior to the effective date of the new regulation, the Board directed the RO to attempt to verify the Veteran's stressors with the U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) (previously the U.S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records (USASCRUR)).  In January 2010, the Veteran's personnel file confirmed that he was assigned to the USS Barney between November 1980 and April 1981 and that it has been verified that the Veteran was deployed in support of the Iranian Hostage Crisis aboard the USS Barney during that time period.  Similarly, in June 2010, the JSRRC confirmed that, in March 1982, while the USS Nicholson was participating in the ASW exercise SHARE 47 in the Ionian Sea, a LAMPS helicopter from the USS McCandless experienced engine failure and radioed to the USS Nicholson for an emergency landing.  The ship's quick response and timely recovery gained her honors as COMNAVAIRLANT's Pro of the Week award, with no damages or casualties reported.  The Veteran was aboard the USS Nicholson at that time.  Thus, two of the Veteran's stressors have been verified.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran underwent a VA PTSD examination in January 2010.  During that examination, the Veteran presented three in-service stressors-a helicopter crash off the USS Nicholson, a friendly fire incident aboard the USS Nicholson, and the USS Barney crossing Gaddafi's \"Line of Death.\"  Following a review of the claims file and examination of the Veteran, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD based on accident involving actual or threatened serious injury or death to others.  Subsequently, the January 2010 VA examiner was informed that the only verified stressor was the fact that the Veteran was assigned to the USS Barney between November 1980 and April 1981, which had been deployed in support of a rescue attempt during the Iranian Hostage Crisis.  In a July 2010 addendum opinion, based on the fact that the Veteran made no reference to the only verifiable stressor or any aspects of that verifiable stressor (deployment of the USS Barney in support of a rescue attempt during the Iranian Hostage Crisis), the VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's PTSD was not caused by or a result of the verifiable stressor nor is the verifiable stressor linked to the Veteran's current PTSD diagnosis.\r\n\r\nAfter the March 1982 helicopter emergency landing incident on the USS Nicholson was verified in June 2010, another opinion was sought from the same VA psychologist who had examined the Veteran in January 2010.  The psychologist first addressed the discrepancy between the Veteran's stressor account (helicopter was shot down killing about 12 people on board) and the stressor verification review (no damages or casualties reported), noting that the Veteran does not always report facts as they are in reality.  The examiner added, given that the Veteran is at least as likely as not to have observed the incident as described in the JSRRC's stressor verification review, the stressor-the March 1982 helicopter emergency landing incident-would be adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and the Veteran's PTSD symptoms are related to this stressor.  Thus, the January 2010 VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's PTSD is caused by or result of his exposure to the incident as described in the stressor verification review.  \r\n\r\nHere, the VA examiner has diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD based on an incident involving actual or threatened serious injury or death to the Veteran and others.  And the verified incident is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's active naval service.  Under the circumstances, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for PTSD.  The Board notes that in reaching this conclusion, the evidence is at least in equipoise, and the benefit of the doubt doctrine has been applied where appropriate.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107; 38 C.F.R. � 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\nIn closing, there is no need to undertake any review of compliance with the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) and implementing regulations in this case since there is no detriment to the Veteran as a result of any VCAA deficiency in view of the fact that the full benefit sought by the Veteran is being granted by this decision of the Board.  See generally 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326(a).  The Veteran was furnished notice of the manner of assigning a disability evaluation and an effective date in January 2009 and again in August 2011.  He will have the opportunity to initiate an appeal from these \"downstream\" issues if he disagrees with the determinations which will be made by the RO in giving effect to the Board's grant of service connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection is warranted for PTSD.

Fleming, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active military service from May 1966 to November 1968.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2006 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Louisville, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that further evidentiary development is necessary before a decision can be reached on the merits of the Veteran's claim for service connection for chronic ischemic heart disease.\r\n\r\nThe law provides that service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304 (2011).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d) (2011).  Generally, establishing service connection requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).\r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted for a disability that is proximately due to or the result of an established service-connected disorder.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310 (2006).  The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that this includes disabilities aggravated or made chronically worse by a service-connected disability.  Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc).\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that there has been an amendment to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 3.310.  See 71 Fed. Reg. 52,744-47 (Sept. 7, 2006).  The amendment sets a standard by which a claim based on aggravation of a non-service-connected disability by a service-connected one is judged.  Although VA has indicated that the purpose of the regulation was merely to apply the Court's ruling in Allen, it was made clear in the comments to the regulation that the changes were intended to place a burden on the claimant to establish a pre-aggravation baseline level of disability for the non-service-connected disability before an award of service connection based on aggravation may be made.  This had not previously been VA's practice, which strongly suggests that the change amounts to a substantive change in the regulation.  Given what appear to be substantive changes, and because the Veteran's claim was pending before the regulatory change was made, the Board will consider the version of 38 C.F.R. � 3.310 in effect before the change, which version favors the claimant.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Veteran's service connection claim, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran contends that he has chronic ischemic heart disease secondary to his service-connected PTSD.  The RO denied the Veteran's claim on the basis that there was no evidence of record to suggest an etiological link between any current heart disability and his service-connected PTSD.\r\n\r\nRegarding diagnosis of the Veteran's heart disability, service treatment records are silent as to any complaints of or treatment for heart problems while the Veteran served on active duty; he was similarly not treated for heart problems for many years after his separation from service.  A review of the Veteran's private treatment records reflects that he was first treated for heart problems in March 2005, when he sought treatment for an acute myocardial infarction.  At that time, he underwent cardiac catheterization and placement of multiple stents.  Review of his VA treatment records shows that since that time, he has received treatment on an ongoing basis for chronic ischemic heart disease, with which he was diagnosed following the March 2005 myocardial infarction.  He was again diagnosed with chronic ischemic heart disease at a February 2006 VA examination, which his examiner attributed to his \"heavy cigarette smoking;\" however, no discussion of the possibility that the disease was aggravated by his service-connected PTSD, was provided in that opinion.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has also submitted multiple statements to VA in which he emphasizes his belief that his service-connected PTSD caused his chronic ischemic heart disease.  In addition, the Veteran has submitted a journal article dated in 2007, in which the article's author notes that studies of veterans diagnosed with PTSD suggest that such veterans are \"at greater risk of heart attacks as they get older\" and have \"worse physical health, more doctor visits and more missed workdays.\"\r\n\r\nOnce VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination when developing a claim for service connection, even if not statutorily obligated to do so, it must provide an adequate one.  See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 464 (2007), citing Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 311; see also Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1, 12 (2001) (emphasizing the Board's duty to return an inadequate examination report \"if further evidence or clarification of the evidence . . . is essential for a proper appellate decision\").\r\n\r\nAlthough it appears that the February 2006 VA examiner attempted to conduct evaluation of the Veteran's physical condition at the time, the Board notes that the VA examiner did not provide an adequate opinion as to whether the Veteran's currently diagnosed chronic ischemic heart disease was caused or worsened by his service-connected PTSD.  Rather, the examiner stated only that she found the Veteran's heart disease to be likely related to his cigarette smoking.  Because the VA examiner did not provide a well-reasoned medical nexus opinion concerning a direct relationship between the Veteran's current heart disease and PTSD, the Board finds that the February 2006 VA medical opinion is inadequate for VA purposes.  See 38 C.F.R. � 4.2 (2011) (providing that where an examination report does not contain sufficient detail, it is inadequate for evaluation purposes); see also Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008) (noting that a medical examination report must contain clear conclusions with supporting data and a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) (holding that a medical opinion must be supported by an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions).  Accordingly, remand is required.\r\n\r\nIn light of the above considerations, the Board concludes that another medical examination and opinion are needed.  Under these circumstances, evidentiary development is needed to fully and fairly evaluate the Veteran's claim of service connection for chronic ischemic heart disease secondary to PTSD.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A (West 2011).  Specifically, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) must arrange for the Veteran to undergo VA examination by a qualified health professional, who must review the Veteran's claims file and his assertions and offer a well-reasoned etiological opinion as to whether the Veteran's PTSD caused his chronic ischemic heart disease or, if not the cause, has made it worse.  Allen, supra.  The 2007 article submitted by the Veteran must be discussed in the context of any negative opinion.\r\n\r\nIn view of the foregoing, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  The Veteran must be sent a letter requesting that he provide sufficient information and, if necessary, authorization to enable VA to obtain any additional pertinent evidence not currently of record.  The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) must explain the type of evidence VA will attempt to obtain as well as the type of evidence that is the Veteran's ultimate responsibility to submit.  \r\n\r\n2.  After associating with the claims file all available records and/or responses received pursuant to the above-requested development, the Veteran must be scheduled for a VA examination and notified that failure to report to any scheduled examination, without good cause, could result in a denial of his claim.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.655(b) (2011).  \r\n\r\nThe VA examination is necessary to determine any relationship between current heart disability and PTSD.  The VA examiner must review the Veteran's claims file and medical history, examine the Veteran, and provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., there is at least a 50 percent probability) that his current chronic ischemic heart disease has been caused or made chronically worse by his service-connected PTSD.  The 2007 article regarding a link between PTSD and heart disorders must be discussed in the context of any negative opinion.\r\n\r\nA well-reasoned opinion must be provided with a detailed explanation for all conclusions reached by the reviewer.  Citations to the record or relevant medical principles should be included as necessary to explain the opinion, and a complete rationale should be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed.  If the examiner determines that he/she cannot provide an opinion on the issue at hand without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain the inability to provide an opinion, identifying precisely what facts could not be determined.  In particular, he/she should comment on whether an opinion could not be rendered because the limits of medical knowledge have been exhausted or whether additional testing or information could be obtained that would lead to a conclusive opinion.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382, 389 (2010).  (The AOJ should ensure that any additional evidentiary development suggested by the examiner be undertaken so that a definite opinion can be obtained.)\r\n\r\n3.  The adjudicator must ensure that the examination report complies with this remand and the questions presented in the examination request.  If any report is deficient, it must be returned to the examiner for necessary corrective action, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n4.  After completing the requested actions and any additional notification and/or development deemed warranted, the claim on appeal must be adjudicated in light of all pertinent evidence and legal authority.  If the benefit sought is not granted, the Veteran must be furnished a supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) and afforded the appropriate time period for response before the claims file is returned to the Board for further appellate consideration.\r\n\r\nBy this remand, the Board intimates no opinion as to any final outcome warranted.  No action is required of the Veteran until he is notified.  The Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis case must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________\r\nMARK F.

Thomas Knope, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from October 1968 to May 1970.\r\n\r\nThis matter is on appeal from an April 2005 decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) describes VA's duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2011); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.326(a) (2011).  For a number of reasons, further development is required prior to adjudication.  \r\n\r\nIn this case, the Veteran submitted a claim seeking entitlement to service connection for PTSD resulting from his service as a combat engineer in the Republic of Vietnam from April 1969 to May 1970.  In a September 2006 statement, he specifically recounted a time where his unit was installing drainage systems along roadways in June or July of 1969 which required a detached infantry unit for protection.  He stated that he was fearful of sniper attacks, and recalled an incident where he was subject to mortar fire.  He also recalled patrolling roadways in search of land mines, where he once saw enemy bodies being moved by loading trucks.  Since that time, he asserts that he has experienced symptoms such as nightmares and hypervigilance.  \r\n\r\nIn April 2005, the RO recognized that the Veteran had been diagnosed with PTSD by some treating physicians, but denied the Veteran's claim on the basis that his stressors could not be corroborated unless he could provide more accurate information.  Notably, the Joint Records and Research Center (JSRRC) stated that, in order to conduct a meaningful search, the Veteran must \"provide the location of the attack and the unit designation for the unit providing security for the project.\"\r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, although the Veteran stated that the mortar attack in June or July 1969, it appears that the JSRRC only reviewed records from July 1969.  In order to prevent prejudice to the Veteran, the relevant records from June 1969 should be reviewed as well. \r\n\r\nThe JSRRC also recommended that the RO conduct a search of the morning reports submitted by the 20th Engineering Battalion, in order to confirm whether any attacks occurred on that unit from June through August, 1969.  While the RO attempted to obtain more information from the Veteran, it is unclear whether the morning reports were actually investigated.  From the Board's view, the PIES response did not answer the RO's request in this matter, and there is no reference to a morning reports search in the RO's June 2010 formal determination that the stressor information was insufficient.  Another attempt should be made to acquire these morning reports.  \r\n\r\nNext, as was noted by the Veteran's representative in May 2011, the provisions relating to the establishment of service connection for PTSD, found at 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), were amended effective July 13, 2010.  See 75 Fed. Reg. 39,843-39,852 (Jul. 13, 2010) and 75 Fed. Reg. 41,092 (Jul. 15, 2010) (effectuating a correction to the July 13, 2010 Federal Register).  \r\n\r\nUnder the amended 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), if a veteran's claimed stressor claimed is related to his or her fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist (or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted) confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD related to the claimed stressor, then the veteran's lay testimony may alone be sufficient to establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor, so long as the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the veteran's service.\r\n\r\n\"Fear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" means that a veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror.\r\n\r\nThe amended regulations may be applicable to the Veteran's situation.  However, the Board notes that he has not been diagnosed with PTSD by a VA examiner.  To the contrary, the VA examiners both in October 2001 and in February 2005 diagnosed depression rather than PTSD.  \r\n\r\nRecognition is given to the Veteran's argument that he has been diagnosed with PTSD during various VA outpatient appointments.  However, the Board stresses that, while the amended regulations provide for a way to establish PTSD without supporting evidence, the lower evidentiary standard applies only of a VA psychologist or psychiatrist (or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted) confirms the claimed stressor which supports the diagnosis.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, the comments associated with the proposal of the amended regulations indicate the intent that the VA examiner's diagnosis must be within the context of a Compensation and Pension examination.   As was noted very recently by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the reasons for this were several:  (1) VA practitioners are given specific instruction on how to conduct PTSD examinations, including guidance materials and a certification process.  (2) The VA reviews the quality of its practitioners' examinations, including taking steps to address identifiable problems with feedback and training.  (3) The VA provides VA associated practitioners with the veterans' claims folders in connection with all mental-disorder examinations, including PTSD examinations, who are instructed that a PTSD diagnosis cannot occur without a review of the folder.  (4) The VA noted that limiting the rule to VA associated practitioners, accompanied by periodic review of these examinations, would ensure standardization and consistency.  Nat'l Org. of Veterans' Advocates, Inc. v. Shinseki, ___ F.3d ___ (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing 75 Fed.Reg. 39,843, 39,847-48 (July 13, 2010)).  Therefore, while the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD by outpatient physicians, these assessments are not sufficient to warrant service connection under the amended regulations.  \r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Board concludes that a new VA examination is warranted, given the recent change to 38 C.F.R. � 3.304 and the receipt of evidence since February 2005.  Specifically, while the VA examiner at that time did not diagnose PTSD, the Veteran did not articulate his stressors until September 2006.  Therefore, there is relevant evidence that is now part of the record that the examiner did not consider.  \r\n\r\nNext, while the Veteran's claim has been primarily characterized as a claim for PTSD, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held that, a claim describing only one particular psychiatric disorder should not necessarily be limited to that disorder.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  Rather, VA should consider the Veteran's claim as one for any psychiatric disability that may reasonably be encompassed by several factors including: the claimant's description of the claim, the symptoms the claimant describes, and information the claimant submits or VA develops and obtains in connection with the claim. Id.  The Veteran has also been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, which has never been considered by the RO, despite the Veteran's statements that he has been experiencing symptoms since active duty.  Therefore, given the Veteran's statements of continuous psychiatric symptoms since active duty, a VA opinion is also necessary to consider this issue as well.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  \r\n\r\nFinally, the Board notes that the Veteran is in receipt of disability benefits from the Social Security Administration (SSA) since 1999, but there is no indication that there has been an attempt to acquire the treatment records the SSA may possess.  In general, VA is required to obtain relevant records held by any Federal department or agency that the claimant adequately identifies and authorizes the Secretary to obtain. 38 U.S.C.A � 5103A(c)(3); Diorio v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 193, 199-200 (2006). \r\n\r\nIndeed, the Court has specifically held that where there has been a determination with regard to SSA benefits, the records concerning that decision must be obtained, if relevant. Tetro v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 100, 108-09 (2000); Murincsak v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 363, 372 (1992); cf. Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (there is no duty to get SSA records when there is no evidence that they are relevant).  Given the likelihood that these records are relevant to the issues on appeal, an attempt should be made to acquire them.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Provide the Veteran with notice regarding the information required by the JSRRC in order to verify a claimed stressor, while allowing him an appropriate amount of time to provide additional information.\r\n\r\nIf, the Veteran provides relevant additional information related to his claimed stressors, and the stressors are of sufficient specificity, the RO should attempt to corroborate his allegations with the appropriate research facilities.  If the stressors are of inadequate specificity to be verified, such a determination should be noted in the record.\r\n\r\nThe AMC should contact the JSRRC in order to review all relevant records related to the Veteran's claimed stressors for the period from June 1 to July 1, 1969.  The AMC should also take action on the JSRRC recommendation to conduct a search of the morning reports submitted by the 20th Engineering Battalion, in order to confirm whether any attacks occurred on that unit from June through August, 1969.  \r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Acquire all available VA treatment records from the VA Medical Center in San Juan, Puerto Rico, since 2006 as well as any prior records not already of record should be associated with the claims file.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran should also be requested to provide any information regarding additional treatment records that he may have in his possession relating to his psychiatric disorders.  If he has received additional treatment since this claim was certified for appeal, the RO should attempt to acquire the associated records, after obtaining the Veteran's authorization.\r\n\r\n3.  Obtain the Veteran's SSA records, including the medical evidence used to determine disability eligibility. If no SSA records are available, it should be so noted in the claims file.\r\n\r\n4.  After the above development has been completed and all outstanding records have been associated with the claims file, the Veteran should be scheduled for a VA psychiatric examination, to be conducted by a VA staff or contracted psychiatrist, or a VA staff or contracted psychologist. \r\n\r\nThe VA examiner should determine whether any of the stressors claimed by the Veteran are related to his fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.  Thereafter, the VA examiner should confirm whether any of the claimed stressors are adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and whether the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor(s).  If a diagnosis of PTSD is deemed appropriate, the examiner must identify the specific stressor(s) underlying the diagnosis, and should comment upon the link between the current symptomatology and the Veteran's claimed stressor(s).\r\n\r\nIf the examiner determines that the clinical evidence does not support a diagnosis of PTSD, to include that the claimed stressors do not support the diagnosis, the examiner should list all diagnosed psychiatric disorders and specifically state whether it is at least as likely as not (a 50 percent probability of greater) that any diagnosed psychiatric disorder either began during or was otherwise caused by the Veteran's military service.   \r\n\r\nThe claims file must be made available to and reviewed by the examiner.  The psychiatrist must provide a complete rationale for all opinions offered.  In this regard, the examiner should note 1) the Veteran's various alleged service stressors/incidents, which are found in written statements; 2) medical records; and 3) lay statements of record. \r\n\r\n5.  After completing the above, and any other development deemed necessary, the RO should readjudicate the Veteran's claim based on the entirety of the evidence.  If the benefit sought on appeal is not granted to the Veteran's satisfaction, he and his representative should be provided with a SSOC. An appropriate period of time should be allowed for response\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nMICHAEL A.

Massey, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the military from March 1969 to October 1970.  His appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) is from a September 2004 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which denied service connection for PTSD.  \r\n\r\nAn appeal to the Board consists of a timely filed notice of disagreement (NOD) in writing and, after a statement of the case (SOC) has been furnished, a timely filed substantive appeal (e.g., a VA Form 9 or equivalent statement).  See 38 C.F.R.        � 20.200 (2011).   After the Veteran filed a timely NOD with the September 2004 decision, the RO issued an SOC on January 23, 2006.  As a general rule, the Veteran must file the substantive appeal within 60 days from the date the SOC is mailed or within the remainder of the one-year time period from the date of mailing of notice of the initial determination being appealed, whichever period ends later.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 7105(d)(3); 38 C.F.R. � 20.302(b) (2011).   After the Veteran failed to file a substantive appeal within 60 days of the SOC, the RO sent him a letter in July 2006 notifying him that the appeal period had expired and that he would need to submit new and material evidence to reopen the claim for service connection for PTSD.  The Board disagrees with the RO's conclusion and will accept his appeal concerning the September 2004 decision as timely.  \r\n\r\nDuring the 60-day appeal period after the SOC was issued, the Veteran's representative submitted a statement in February 2006 requesting that the Veteran be afforded a hearing with a Decision Review Officer at the RO prior to filing an appeal with the Board.  He indicated that he wished to have his hearing prior to perfecting his appeal.  In an April 2006 statement, the Veteran indicated that he was still waiting to hear back about his hearing.  Rather than schedule a hearing, however, the RO notified the Veteran in a July 2006 letter that the appeal period had expired and that if he wished to pursue his claim he would need to submit new and material evidence.  The Veteran did so by filing a claim in August 2006, which eventually resulted in his submitting a substantive appeal in July 2009.  \r\n\r\nSince the Veteran's hearing request occurred during the 60-day appeal period from the issuance of the SOC, the Board will accept his July 2009 substantive appeal as timely.  While the purpose for delaying the filing of a substantive appeal until after a hearing remains unclear, he clearly demonstrated his understanding of the need to file a substantive appeal and essentially conveyed his intent to do so.  The Board emphasizes that the time limit for filing a substantive appeal is not a jurisdictional requirement and may be waived either explicitly or implicitly.  See Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 46 (2009) (holding that 38 U.S.C.A. � 7105(d)(3) does not operate as a mandatory jurisdictional bar precluding the Board from considering an appeal where the substantive appeal is untimely, rather, in light of the use of the term \"may\" in this statute, it merely gives the Board this discretionary authority not to.); see also Gonzalez-Morales v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 556, 557 (2003).  In addition, the period for filing a substantive appeal also may be extended for good cause, 38 C.F.R. � 20.303, and, under certain circumstances, a statutory filing period may be equitably tolled due to conduct of VA.  See Bailey v. West, 160 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 1998).  \r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the Board finds that the time limit for filing the substantive appeal in response to the January 2006 SOC should be extended and the Veteran's July 2009 appeal accepted as timely.  Bailey, 160 F.3d at 1365 (holding that equitable tolling in the paternalistic Veterans' benefits context does not require misconduct, such as trickery, but does require the appellant to have been \"misled by the conduct of his adversary into allowing the filing deadline to pass.\").  See also Percy, 23 Vet. App. at 45 (a substantive appeal, unlike an NOD, is not a \"jurisdictional\" document for the Board).  \r\n\r\nThat being said, the Board notes that the Veteran's July 2009 VA Form 9 indicates that he wants a Board hearing at the RO.  However, he has since withdrawn his hearing request.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD by VA psychiatrists based on in-service stressors which appear credible and consistent with the circumstances of his service in Vietnam.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1154, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2011); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2011). \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBefore addressing the underlying merits of a claim, the Board is generally required to ensure that VA's duties to notify and assist obligations have been satisfied under the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA).  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5103, 5103A; 38 C.F.R. � 3.159.  Since the Board is granting the claim for service connection for PTSD, there is no need to discuss whether there has been compliance with these notice and duty-to-assist provisions of the VCAA.  Shinseki v. Sanders, 129 S. Ct. 1696 (2009); 38 C.F.R. � 20.1102 (2011).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran claims that he developed PTSD as a result of stressors he experienced while serving in Vietnam as a truck driver.  These stressors include coming under rocket and mortar attack while driving convoys carrying ammunition.  He is seeking service connection for PTSD based on these claimed in-service stressors.  For the reasons set forth below, the Board finds that the evidence supports his claim.\r\n\r\nService connection is granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service in the line of duty.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).  Service connection for PTSD, in particular, requires:  [1] a current medical diagnosis of the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a), [2] credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor(s) actually occurred, and [3] medical evidence of a causal relationship between current symptomatology and the specific claimed in-service stressor(s).  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nA diagnosis of PTSD must be established in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a), which mandates that, for VA purposes, all mental disorder diagnoses must conform to the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-IV.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  The Court has taken judicial notice of the mental health profession's adoption of the DSM-IV.  See Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 140-41 (1997).  According to the current criteria, a diagnosis of PTSD requires exposure to a traumatic event, or stressor.  A stressor involves exposure to a traumatic event in which the person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others, and the person's response involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror.  The sufficiency of a stressor is a medical determination, and the occurrence of a claimed stressor is an adjudicatory determination.  Id.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the stressor element, the general rule is that there must be credible evidence to support the Veteran's assertion that the stressful event occurred.  A medical opinion diagnosing PTSD does not suffice to verify the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressors.  Cohen, 10 Vet. App. at 142; Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395-396 (1996).  Exceptions to this general rule are when the claimed in-stressors occurred during combat, while being held as a prisoner of war (POW), due to a personal assault, or due to \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.\"  38 C.F.R. 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nThis last exception involving \"fear of hostile or terrorist activity\" was recently added.  Specifically, 38 C.F.R. 3.304(f) was amended in order to liberalize the requirement of verification or corroboration of a Veteran's claimed in-service stressor events in a PTSD claim.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3), as added in 75 Fed. Reg. 39,843 -852 (July 13, 2010).  This new version of 38 CFR � 3.304(f)(3) eliminates the requirement for corroborating evidence of a claimed stressor is related to the Veteran's \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" and a VA or VA-contracted psychiatrist or psychologist confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor so long as there is not clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) (effective July 13, 2010); see also 75 Fed. Reg. 39,843 (July 13, 2010). \r\n\r\nFor purposes of this paragraph, \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" means that a Veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the Veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the Veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3). \r\n\r\nApplying these criteria to the facts of this case, the Board finds that the evidence supports the claim that the Veteran has PTSD as a result of service.  Several VA psychiatrists have diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD based on alleged in-service stressors.  A January 2004 report lists a diagnosis of PTSD, chronic, based on findings from a mental status examination and an interview in which the Veteran claimed that his convoy in Vietnam had come under enemy attack.  An October 2004 report also lists a diagnosis of combat-related PTSD based on the same stressor of his convoy coming under enemy attack in Vietnam, as well as additional stressors of seeing a helicopter get shot down and having to take cover in bunkers during mortar and rocket attacks.  \r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the Veteran has meet all three elements of a PTSD claim.  First, he clearly has a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a).  Second, evidence also establishes that his PTSD is related to a verified in-service stressor.   In reaching this conclusion, the evidence does not indicate that the Veteran's claimed in-stressors occurred while being held as a prisoner of war (POW) or that they are due to a personal assault.  It is also unclear whether the Veteran engaged in combat with an enemy force.  While the Veteran claims to have been involved in combat, which is noted in his diagnosis, this has not been confirmed by his service personnel records.  Also, he was not awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge, Purple Heart Medal, or any other award typically associated with valor or heroism shown while engaged in combat with an enemy force.  In light of these findings, there is no evidence confirming his involvement in combat while serving in Vietnam. See VAOPGCPREC 12-99 (October 18, 1999). \r\n\r\nNevertheless, his stressors of coming under enemy attack during convoys appear to fall within the purview of this new version of subpart (f)(3).  Since his service personnel records show that he was stationed in Vietnam from July 23, 1969, until October 8, 1970, during which time he was a heavy vehicle driver, his claimed stressors are consistent with the circumstances and conditions of his service.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) (effective July 13, 2010); see also 75 Fed. Reg. 39,843 (July 13, 2010).  In addition, the type of stressors he identified (coming under rocket and mortar attack during convoys) meets the definition of \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.\"  And since VA psychiatrists have concluded that the Veteran has PTSD based on these in-service stressors, the Board will accept the Veteran's lay statement without corroborating evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3).  See also Suozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307 (1997) and Pentecost v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 124, 128-129   (2002) (holding that corroboration of every detail, including the Veteran's personal participation, defines \"corroboration\" far too narrowly.)\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, evidence supports a finding that the Veteran suffers from PTSD as a result of stressors he experienced while on active duty.  Service connection for PTSD is therefore warranted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(CONTINUED NEXT PAGE)\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is granted. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nMICHAEL A.

Connolly, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from October 1960 to September 1961.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2005 decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Los Angeles, California.  In October 2009, the Board remanded this case.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nA psychiatric disability including PTSD, major depressive disorder, an anxiety disorder NOS, and an anxiety disorder with psychosis, is attributable to service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nA psychiatric disability including was incurred in active service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1131 (West 2002 & Supp. 2010); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304(f) (2010).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThere has been a significant change in the law with the enactment of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA).  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326.  The Veteran's claim is being granted.  As such, any deficiencies with regard to VCAA are harmless and nonprejudicial.\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1131; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304.  Further, VA regulation provides that, with chronic disease shown as such in service (or within an applicable presumptive period under section 3.307) so as to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.  For the showing of chronic disease in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word \"chronic.\"  When the disease identity is established (leprosy, tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis, etc.), there is no requirement of an evidentiary showing of continuity.  Continuity of symptomatology is required only where the condition noted during service (or in the presumptive period) is not, in fact, shown to be chronic or where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned. When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, then a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support the claim.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b).\r\n\r\nIn addition, service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nService connection for posttraumatic stress disorder requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with �4.125(a) of this chapter; a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nThe following provisions apply to claims for service connection of posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosed during service or based on the specified type of claimed stressor:\r\n\r\n(1) If the evidence establishes a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder during service and the claimed stressor is related to that service, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.\r\n\r\n(2) If the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.\r\n\r\n(3) If a stressor claimed by the Veteran is related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder and that the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  For purposes of this paragraph, \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" means that a Veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the Veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the Veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror.\r\n\r\n(4) If the evidence establishes that the Veteran was a prisoner-of-war under the provisions of �3.1(y) of this part and the claimed stressor is related to that prisoner-of-war experience, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.\r\n\r\n(5) If a posttraumatic stress disorder claim is based on in-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than the Veteran's service records may corroborate the veteran's account of the stressor incident.  Examples of such evidence include, but are not limited to: records from law enforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy.  Evidence of behavior changes following the claimed assault is one type of relevant evidence that may be found in these sources.  Examples of behavior changes that may constitute credible evidence of the stressor include, but are not limited to: a request for a transfer to another military duty assignment; deterioration in work performance; substance abuse; episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable cause; or unexplained economic or social behavior changes.  VA will not deny a posttraumatic stress disorder claim that is based on in-service personal assault without first advising the claimant that evidence from sources other than the veteran's service records or evidence of behavior changes may constitute credible supporting evidence of the stressor and allowing him or her the opportunity to furnish this type of evidence or advise VA of potential sources of such evidence. VA may submit any evidence that it receives to an appropriate medical or mental health professional for an opinion as to whether it indicates that a personal assault occurred.\r\n\r\nIn determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the veteran prevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  To do so, the Board must assess the credibility and weight of all the evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence that it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the appellant.  See Masors v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 181 (1992).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the Veteran was not in combat service, nor does he assert such as he served in peacetime.  Here, the Board must pay particular attention to the requirements of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(5), which, as addressed above, provide that VA must consider other substitute forms of evidence and information, beyond that contained in the Veteran's service records, as possible evidence in support of the occurrence of a claimed in-service stressor related to personal assault.  Claims involving personal assaults fall within the category of situations in which it is not unusual for there to be an absence of service records documenting the events the Veteran has alleged.  See, e.g., Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. at 281.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he endured several stressors during service.  He contends that during service about the USS Klondike AR22, he was beaten in his bunk, was locked in a freezer, was kicked, was thrown in the brig with minimal food or water, and was served contaminated food.  He was also called a racial slur.  He asserts that he lost over 50 pounds, became ill and distressed, and consulted with the ship's doctor and chaplain.  He contends that he was nauseated, threw up blood, and had diarrhea.  In addition, he reported that someone he knew died from asphyxiation due to fumes aboard the ship.  \r\n\r\nA review of the service treatment records shows that when he entered service, according to his September 1960 entrance examination, he reported that he had nervous trouble and described having motion sickness.  Psychiatric evaluation was normal.  There are several incidents of the Veteran being seen for sea sickness during service.  \r\n\r\nIn August 1961, the Veteran was seen at a naval hospital and was diagnosed as having passive aggressive reaction.  It was noted that he was referred to the hospital because of severe, chronic seasickness, nervousness, and apprehension.  The Veteran reported that while aboard ship, he was seasick and was unable to do much work.  He related that his buddies resented this and started saying things about him and started rumors.  Since that time, he had gotten along poorly with the other seamen and had been nervous.  He continued to get seasick and had severe headaches.  He stated that he was \"about to lose\" himself.  Poor relations with the seamen and his superiors were noted, as well as a past poor relationship with his father.  It was indicated that the Veteran had poor peer relations and an inability to carry out orders.  Other clinical records noted that the Veteran had been seen by the inservice examiner as well as the chaplain to see if he could be transferred back to the United States.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was then determined to have an emotional instability reaction (personality disorder) and was unsuitable for service.  It was determined that he had a severe disposition for this diagnosis since childhood, that is not incurred or aggravated during service, and it was recommended that he be discharged.  The service treatment records do not provide any additional information regarding the Veteran's service.  \r\n\r\nPost-service, a March 2005 report from a Vet Center indicated that the Veteran described harassment and physical abuse during service, which coincides with stressor information reported by the Veteran.  It was noted that when the USS Klondike docked in Japan, the Veteran had to be hospitalized for exhaustion, malnutrition, and psychological decompensation.  Since discharge, the Veteran had been plagued by distressing and intrusive thoughts of what he endured aboard the USS Klondike.  A mental status examination was performed which resulted in diagnoses of PTSD as well as major depression.  The Veteran was subsequently treated by VA on an outpatient basis.  The diagnosis again was PTSD due to the military.  The Veteran was also treated at the National Center for PTSD.  \r\n\r\nIn a subsequent April 2008 letter, a VA clinical psychologist indicated that the Veteran had been diagnosed as having PTSD.  She noted that the diagnosis was based on the Veteran's statements, assuming they were true.  She noted that the Veteran's stressors could not be verified.  She also indicated that he had been diagnosed as having a psychosis.  She opined that if the inservice stressors were true, the diagnosis of PTSD was valid, but if they could not be verified, the Veteran was still experiencing difficulty in his functioning that emerged when he was in the military and as a result of his military service.  She stated that whether it was labeled as PTSD with anxiety, not otherwise specified (NOS), or anxiety NOS with psychosis, the Veteran continued to have difficulty functioning, holding a job, and interacting with others.  She opined that these difficulties emerged during military service.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's wife also provided a statement in which she indicated that she did not know the Veteran prior to service.  She considered him to be honorable and there was no doubt in her mind that his problems started aboard the USS Klondike when he was basically tortured.  She described his current symptoms and actions.  \r\n\r\nThe Board observes that the Veteran's service treatment records show no specific indication of treatment for the residuals of a \"personal assault.\"  However, it is documented that the Veteran suffered from severe sea sickness, had trouble getting along with his peers, and had trouble taking orders from his superiors.  He was discharged for a personality disorder and the inservice psychiatric manifestations were attributed to that personality disorder which the inservice medical personnel indicated preexisted service and predisposed him to have his inservice manifestations.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the Veteran's current diagnosis is not a personality disorder.  He has been diagnosed as having PTSD, major depressive disorder, an anxiety disorder NOS, and an anxiety disorder with psychosis.  The description of stressors is not the kind that can be verified by VA.  However, a VA clinical psychologist has provided an opinion that regardless of the Veteran's current diagnosis, his current psychiatric diagnoses began during service.  \r\n\r\nIn sum, there is no inservice specific evidence which corroborates the Veteran's allegations regarding the claimed stressors.  There is general information which clearly shows that the Veteran had sea sickness, problems getting along with others, and saw by the doctor and chaplain, as he has stated.  As noted above, inservice evidence is not required in this type of claim, and there may be considered other corroborating evidence.  In this case, there is other evidence which weighs in favor of and against the Veteran's claim.  This evidence consists of the service treatment records which show that he had a preexisting personality disorder as well as the post-service medical evidence showing other psychiatric diagnoses and the medical opinion which attributes them to service.  The VA clinical psychologist is competent to make that complex assessment.  See generally Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007).\r\n\r\nIn addition, with regard to the psychiatric diagnoses other than PTSD, the VA examiner attributed those to service.  Those diagnoses are not covered by the PTSD regulation and an examiner is certainly competent to state that manifestations began during service or are otherwise attributable to service.  The Board acknowledges the recent ruling in Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009), which clarified how the Board should analyze claims for PTSD and other acquired psychiatric disorders.  As emphasized in Clemons, though a Veteran may only seek service connection for one specific psychiatric disorder, the Veteran's claim \"cannot be limited only to that diagnosis, but must rather be considered a claim for any mental disability that may be reasonably encompassed.\"  Id.  Essentially, the Court found that a Veteran does not file a claim to receive benefits only for an acquired psychiatric disorder, such as PTSD, but in fact makes a general claim for whatever mental condition may be afflicting the Veteran.  Therefore, the Board must analyze the Veteran's current claim under this expanded framework, based on the Clemons ruling and appropriate review of the evidence of record.  As such, the Board recognizes that the other psychiatric diagnoses were attributed to service and should be considered for service connection, even though the Veteran did not specifically claim service connection for those disorders.  Further, the Board recognizes that the Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD, appears to include or be associated with these other diagnoses.  \r\n\r\nIn affording the Veteran the benefit-of-the-doubt, as required by VA law and regulations, there is evidence that tends to corroborate the existence of the claimed inservice stressors.  Specifically, the Veteran was seen for psychiatric symptoms during service.  Although attributed to a personality disorder at that time, the Veteran does not currently have a diagnosis of that personality disorder and his current diagnoses have been determined to have been etiologically connected to those inservice manifestations by the VA clinical psychologist.  She is competent to make a current diagnosis.  Further, there is nothing suggesting that the Veteran has only had one psychiatric diagnosis.  The Board is persuaded by the psychologist's conclusions that the Veteran's manifestations of his current psychiatric disorders began during service, particularly since she considered that this was the case even if verification of the stressors could not be made for PTSD.  The Board may not base a decision on its own unsubstantiated medical conclusions but, rather, may reach a medical conclusion only on the basis of independent medical evidence in the record.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155 (1993).  Health professionals are experts and are presumed to know the requirements applicable to their practice and to have taken them into account in providing a diagnosis.  See Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 137 (1997).\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is credible and persuasive evidence which places the evidence for and against the claim in equipoise.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence in this case is so evenly balanced so as to allow application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule and service connection for PTSD, major depressive disorder, an anxiety disorder NOS, and an anxiety disorder with psychosis, is warranted.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a psychiatric disability including PTSD, major depressive disorder, an anxiety disorder NOS, and an anxiety disorder with psychosis, is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nSARAH B.

R. dela Rosa\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active military service from January 1976 to November 1977. \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2010 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Petersburg, Florida. \r\n\r\nIn April 2011 a Travel Board hearing was held before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge.  The transcript of that hearing is of record.  Evidence was thereafter submitted directly to the Board with a waiver of agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) consideration.  See 38 C.F.R. � 20.1304.  However, as the case must be remanded, the RO will also have an opportunity to review this evidence.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran seeks service connection for PTSD as a result of an in-service personal assault.  See Veteran's September 2009 stressor statement.\r\n\r\nThe evidence shows that the Veteran has been diagnosed with multiple psychiatric disabilities, including PTSD, depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and mood disorder.  In Clemons the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that, in determining the scope of a claim, the Board must consider the claimant's description of the claim; symptoms described; and the information submitted or developed in support of the claim.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009).  \r\n\r\nIn light of the Court's decision in Clemons, the Board has re-characterized the psychiatric issue on appeal as entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.  This will provide the most favorable review of the Veteran's claim in keeping with the Court's holding in Clemons.\r\n\r\n\r\nVA medical records show that the Veteran sought treatment for complaints of depression and panic attacks.  A March 2005 mental health note assessed the Veteran as having probable PTSD as a result of military sexual trauma and depression secondary to PTSD.  In August 2010, a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was also provided.  \r\n\r\nPrivate medical records include a January 2010 letter that diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD as a result of assault in the military as well as residual childhood issues.  The Veteran's counselor opined that the Veteran suffered from PTSD as a result of the reported sexual assault he endured while in the military.  \r\n\r\nDuring his April 2011 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he was sexually assaulted in the military by fellow service members.  He testified that he did not tell anyone about the incident until he started seeing a VA psychiatrist.  He testified that he received an Article 15 as a result of discharging a firearm in the barracks.  He also testified that he disassociated with everybody.\r\n\r\nUnder 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(d)(2) (West 2002), VA must provide a medical examination and/or obtain a medical opinion when there is:  (1) competent evidence that the veteran has a current disability (or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a  disability); (2) evidence establishing that he suffered an event, injury or disease in service or has a disease or symptoms of a disease within a specified presumptive period; (3) an indication the current disability or symptoms may be associated with service; and (4) there is not sufficient medical evidence to make a decision.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  The third prong, which requires that the evidence of record \"indicate\" that the claimed disability or symptoms \"may be\" associated with the established event, is a low threshold.  McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83.  The Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination.  The Veteran should be accorded a VA examination to address the etiology of psychiatric conditions present.  \r\n\r\nSince the claims file is being returned it should also be updated to include recent VA treatment records dating from April 26, 2011.  See Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, D.C., for the following action: \r\n\r\n1.  Associate with the claims folder VAMC medical records dating from April 26, 2011.  If no further treatment records exist, the claims file should be documented accordingly. \r\n\r\n2.  Schedule the Veteran for an appropriate examination regarding his claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and mood disorder.  The claims file must be made available to, and reviewed by, the examiner, and the examiner must note in his report that the claims file was reviewed.  All indicated tests must be performed, and all findings reported in detail.  The examiner is specifically requested to set forth the diagnosis for all psychiatric disorders found and opine as to whether any diagnosed condition at least as likely as not (50 percent probability or greater) began in or is related to his active service.  The examiner should reconcile the diagnosis or diagnoses found on examination with the diagnoses of record, including PTSD, depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and mood disorder.  \r\n\r\nThe psychiatric examiner is requested to review the Veteran's service treatment records, service personnel records, and the other evidence of record to include the June 2010 statement from his friend, for the purpose of determining whether a personal assault occurred.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner must provide a comprehensive report including rationales for all opinions and conclusions.  \r\n\r\n3.  After completing the above, and any other development as may be indicated by any response received as a consequence of the actions taken in the preceding paragraphs, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, should be readjudicated based on the entirety of the evidence.  If the claim remains denied, the Veteran and his representative should be issued a supplemental statement of the case.  An appropriate period of time should be allowed for response.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Bryant, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active service from April 1968 to March 1970.\r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision in August 2007 by the above Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nAt no time during the current appeal period has the Veteran been shown to have a an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nService connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is not established.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304(f) (2011).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nDuty to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) enhanced VA's duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating their claim for VA benefits, as codified in pertinent part at 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2009); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.326(a) (2011).\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application for benefits, VA is required to notify the claimant and his representative of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  Proper notice from VA must inform the claimant of any information and evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide.  38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1), as amended, 73 Fed. Reg. 23,353 (April 30, 2008).  This notice must be provided prior to an initial decision on a claim by the RO.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004). \r\n\r\nThe VCAA notice requirements apply to all five elements of a service connection claim:  (1) veteran status; (2) existence of disability; (3) connection between service and the disability; (4) degree of disability; and (5) effective date of benefits where a claim is granted.  Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 484 (2006).\r\n\r\nIf complete notice is not provided until after the initial adjudication, such a timing error can be cured by subsequent legally adequate VCAA notice, followed by readjudication of the claim, as in a Statement of the Case (SOC) or Supplemental SOC (SSOC).  Moreover, where there is an uncured timing defect in the notice, subsequent action by the RO which provides the claimant a meaningful opportunity to participate in the processing of the claim can prevent any such defect from being prejudicial.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 499 F.3d 1317, 1323-24 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Prickett v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 370, 376 (2006).\r\n\r\nIn a pre-adjudication letter dated in June 2007, the RO informed the Veteran of its duty to assist him in substantiating his PTSD claim under the VCAA, and the effect of this duty upon his claim.  This letter also informed him of how disability ratings and effective dates are assigned, if service connection were to be granted.  See Dingess v. Nicholson, supra.  He has not demonstrated any error in VCAA notice, and therefore the presumption of prejudicial error as to such notice does not arise in this case.  See Hartman v. Nicholson, 483 F.3d 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Shinseki v. Sanders, 129 S.Ct. 1696 (2009).\r\n\r\nThe Board also finds that VA has satisfied its duty to assist the Veteran in the development of his PTSD claim.  His in-service and pertinent post-service treatment reports are of record.  Attempts were made to obtain Social Security Administration records(SSA). SSA indicated that it had made exhaustive efforts and there were no records relating to the Veteran. While VA did not provide the Veteran with an examination and/or did not obtain a medical opinion, the Board finds that VA had no obligation to do so in connection with the current appeal because both the STRs and post service treatment records are completely negative for evidence of a diagnosis of PTSD or any other psychiatric disability.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(d); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); Paralyzed Veterans of America, et. al., v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, 345 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (holding that, if the evidence of record does not establish that the veteran suffered an event, injury, or disease in service, no reasonable possibility exists that providing a medical examination or obtaining a medical opinion would substantiate the claim); Godfrey v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 113, 121 (1995) (holding that the Board is not required to accept a medical opinion that is based on the veteran's recitation of medical history); Duenas v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 512, 519 (2004) (holding that VA is not obligated to provide an examination for a medical nexus opinion where, as here, the supporting evidence of record consists only of a lay statement).  As discussed in further detail below, the Veteran has failed to submit or identify any medical evidence showing a current psychiatric diagnosis of any kind.  Accordingly, an examination is not required here, even under the low threshold of McLendon.  \r\n\r\nThus, the Board concludes that no further notice or assistance to the Veteran is required to fulfill VA's duty to assist him in the development of his service connection claim.  No useful purpose would be served in remanding this matter for yet more development.  A remand would result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA, with no additional benefit to the Veteran.  Smith v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 227 (2000), aff'd 281 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143 (2001); & Quartuccio v. Principi, supra.  \r\n\r\nLaw and Analysis\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated in active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).  \r\n\r\nTo establish entitlement to service connection for PTSD, the record must contain the following:  (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f); see also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  \r\n\r\nAfter considering all information and lay and medical evidence of record with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt will be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102.  The benefit-of-the-doubt rule is inapplicable when the evidence preponderates against the claim.  Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001). \r\n\r\nThe Veteran is seeking service connection for psychiatric problems.  He asserts that because of his experiences in Vietnam he is sensitive to loud noise and has great difficulty during New Year's and July 4th celebrations.  He reports that he underwent an employer-provided psychiatric evaluation with complaints of these problems, but that this occurred before the diagnosis of PTSD was known to most medical specialists.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's DD Form 214 and personnel records, which are already associated with the claims file, indicate that he served in Vietnam as a field communications crewman with the HHSB 6th Battalion 11th Artillery.  Although it is unquestioned that the Veteran served in Vietnam during the Vietnam War era, the primary impediment to a grant of service connection in this case is the absence of medical evidence of a current psychiatric disorder.  \r\n\r\nThe existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328 (1997) (holding that the VA's and the Court's interpretation of sections 1110 and 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary and therefore the decision based on that interpretation must be affirmed); see also Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim.  Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143- 44 (1992).\r\n\r\nTurning to the evidence of record, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not contain any reports of psychiatric complaints or findings.  \r\n\r\nThe lack of evidence of in-service incurrence is not, however, the only shortcoming in this claim, as no records of post-service treatment for psychiatric complaints or symptomatology have been submitted or identified.  In a March 2007 statement, the Veteran indicated that when hired by Buick Motors Division in 1970 he was referred for psychological evaluation after indicating that loud noise would affect his ability to work.  He later submitted records from his former employer, General Motors Corporation (GM) which show he underwent periodic physicals and audiological testing between 1990 and 2004.  However these records are entirely negative for psychiatric complaints or findings.  \r\n\r\nIn the absence of a clear psychiatric diagnosis, or symptomatology an award of service connection is not warranted.  While sensitivity to loud noise is the type of symptom capable of lay observation, the record is devoid of evidence to suggest that the Veteran has ever been seen or treated for PTSD or any related psychiatric condition, either during service or after service separation.  See Sanchez-Benitez v. Principi, 239 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Sanchez-Benitez v. West, 13 Vet. App. 282 (1999) (service connection may not be granted for symptoms unaccompanied by a diagnosed disability).  The Board does not dispute that the Veteran may experience some sort of symptomatology, but there is no objective clinical confirmation that he suffers from an actual psychiatric disorder and his post-service contention alone cannot satisfy the criteria for a current disability.  \r\n\r\nIndeed, without a finding that the Veteran has been diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder at any time during the appeal period, no valid claim for service connection exists.  See also McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007) (which stipulates that a service connection claim may be granted if a diagnosis of a chronic disability was made during the pendency of the appeal, even if the most recent medical evidence suggests that the disability resolved).  Based on this evidentiary posture, service connection cannot be awarded.  Moreover as a clear preponderance of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD, consideration of any association between his current symptomatology and his claimed in-service stressors is not necessary.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Board has not overlooked the Veteran's contentions.  As to his assertions that he developed a psychiatric disorder due to military service, the Board is aware that lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology and \"may provide sufficient support for a claim of service connection.\"  Jones v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 134, 137 (1994); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994) Buchanan v. Nicolson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  When a condition may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features, the presence of the disorder is not a determination \"medical in nature\" and is capable of lay observation.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316.  \r\n\r\nLay evidence can also be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Federal Circuit Court also held in Buchanan (and Davidson and Jandreau), however, that the Board retains the discretion to make credibility determinations and otherwise weigh the evidence submitted, including lay evidence.  So to ultimately have probative value, the Veteran's assertions also have to be credible and judged in relation to the other evidence in the file - including any medical evidence addressing the determinative issue of causation.  See Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67 (1997) and Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 469 (1994) (distinguishing between competency (\"a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered\") and credibility (\"a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted\")). \r\n\r\nThat said, the Board notes that the Veteran is not a medical professional, and therefore, his beliefs and statements about medical matters do not constitute competent evidence on matters of medical etiology or diagnosis.  See Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492 (1992).  A veteran generally can report his or her observations concerning symptoms, but in this particular case, the Veteran is not competent to establish a current diagnosis by his lay statements as such would require medical expertise and diagnostic testing in order for a correct diagnosis to be rendered.  \r\n\r\nIn other words, while the Veteran is competent to report his military duties and experiences, his opinion regarding the etiology of his claimed psychiatric symptoms is not a statement merely about symptomatology, an observable medical condition, or a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, but rather clearly falls within the realm of requiring medical expertise, which he simply does not have.  Consequently, the probative value of the Veteran's implied or explicit assertions that he has PTSD are greatly outweighed by the objective findings of record.  Compare Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007) (unlike varicose veins or a dislocated shoulder, rheumatic fever is not a condition capable of lay diagnosis) with Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376 (lay witness capable of diagnosing dislocated shoulder); Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 308-309 (lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of varicose veins); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 405 (1995) (lay person competent to testify to pain and visible flatness of his feet).  The problem in this case is that there is no competent evidence of a psychiatric diagnosis at any time during the current appeal.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for service connection for a right shoulder disability, and there is no reasonable doubt to be resolved.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b).  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nK.

He was recalled to active duty from March 1992 to August 1992.  His overseas tours included service in Vietnam and Kuwait. \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2005 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Columbia, South Carolina, which denied service connection for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with CHF.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified at a personal hearing in a June 2008 videoconference hearing before a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) who is no longer employed by the Board.  A transcript of the hearing is contained in the record. \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn June 2008, the Veteran provided testimony before a VLJ who is no longer employed at the Board.  In a statement received in April 2012, the Veteran indicated his desire to appear at a Travel Board hearing before a VLJ who will finally decide his case.  Accordingly, the case must be returned to the RO to schedule such a hearing.  38 U.S.C.A. � 7107; 38 C.F.R. �� 19.75, 19.76, 20.703, 20.704.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\nThe RO should schedule the Veteran for a Travel Board hearing in the order that the request was received.  After a hearing is conducted, or if the Veteran withdraws his hearing request or fails to report for the scheduled hearing, the claims file should be returned to the Board for appellate review.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.

Barone, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active service from September 1995 to February 1996 and from December 2003 to March 2005.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Columbia, South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was scheduled to testify before a Veteran's Law Judge in August 2009 but failed to report for his hearing. \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD that is related to service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1154(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304 (2011).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) describes VA's duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2010); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326(a) (2011).  As the Board has concluded that service connection is warranted for PTSD, further discussion of the VCAA is not necessary. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nEntitlement to VA compensation may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active duty.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110 (wartime service), 1131 (peacetime service); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: \"(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service\"-the so-called \"nexus\" requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).   \r\n\r\nService connection for post-traumatic stress disorder requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with VA regulations; a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  If the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d), (f).\r\n\r\nThe Board observes that effective July 12, 2010, the regulations governing adjudication of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were liberalized, in certain circumstances, with respect to the evidentiary standard for establishing the required in-service stressor.  For cases pending before VA as of that date, the following regulation applies:\r\n\r\nIf a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  For purposes of this paragraph, \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" means that a Veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the Veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the Veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (f)(3); see 75 Fed. Reg. 39843 (July 13, 2010).  As discussed below, the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of PTSD; therefore, this amendment does not apply.  \r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b) (West 2002).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the record includes the Veteran's report on a post-deployment health assessment that he served at Camp Bucca in Iraq.  His personnel records reflect that he was present in Iraq from February 2004 through February 2005.  They also indicate that he was a multiple launch rocket system crew member with a field artillery unit.  \r\n\r\nIn a July 2007 statement, the Veteran indicated that he had been having problems with sleeplessness, nightmares, hyper vigilance, and anger.  He stated that his family had told him that he was behaving differently since his return from Iraq.  He noted that his doctor had referred him to mental health but that he had missed that appointment and was told that he was not allowed to reschedule.  He requested assistance in getting his problem diagnosed.\r\n\r\nAn October 2007 VA outpatient record indicates an assessment of PTSD.\r\n\r\nOn VA examination in March 2008, the Veteran's history was reviewed.  He noted that he was with a field artillery unit and that he ran relay points in the desert, in addition to performing security on broken down vehicles.  He indicated that there were daily explosions and that he felt that he was in constant danger.  He noted that he viewed a beheading on the internet and thereafter was much more fearful for his own life.  He described an incident when the camp was being fired on, seeing the tracer rounds going over his head.  Following interview and mental status examination, the examiner provided diagnoses of PTSD, alcohol abuse versus dependence, major depression, and nicotine dependence.  She stated that the Veteran clearly met the criteria for a diagnosis of PSTD.  She noted that he was in an imminent danger pay area and felt helpless and horrified with the events taking place in Iraq.  She indicated that his fear was increased after viewing a beheading on the internet.  She noted that since his return from Iraq, the Veteran reported problems with insomnia, nightmares, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, decreased concentration and short term memory, distractibility, difficulty identifying and expressing emotions, emotional  numbing, difficulty with trust, a sense of estrangement, isolation, anhedonia, irritability, low frustration tolerance, depression with passive suicidal ideation, anxiety, and avoidance.  \r\n\r\nAfter careful consideration of the evidence, the Board finds that service connection for PTSD is warranted.  Here, the VA examiner concluded that the Veteran met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD and linked the PTSD diagnosis to the Veteran's anxiety over his belief that he was in constant danger while he was in Iraq.  She noted that the Veteran's response to this threat included feelings of helplessness and horror.  The Veteran's reported stressor was accepted by the VA examiner, who confirmed that it was adequate to support the diagnosis.  There is no contrary opinion or evidence of record.  The Board finds that the reported stressor is consistent with the circumstances of the Veteran's service.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that service connection for PTSD may be granted.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nDAVID L.

Mishalanie, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from August 1974 to September 1976.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 6006 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Montgomery, Alabama.  \r\n\r\nIn December 2009, the Board remanded the claim to the RO, via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), for additional development.  In an April 2012 letter, the Veteran withdrew his request for a Board hearing.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO, via the Appeals Management Center (AMC) in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Board's review of the claims file reveals that further RO action is warranted.  Specifically, in November 2010, the AMC sent a supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) to the Veteran's previous address instead of his then-current address of record.  The SSOC was returned from the U.S. Postal Service.  Therefore, a remand is necessary to correct this due process deficiency.\r\n\r\nNext, a review of the Veteran's treatment records reflects diagnoses of bipolar disorder, PTSD, major depressive disorder, and polysubstance dependence.  In August 2010, he underwent a VA psychiatric examination to determine the current nature and etiology of his claimed acquired psychiatric disorder.  The examiner opined that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.  Other than polysubstance dependence, the examiner did not diagnose any psychiatric disorders.  \r\n\r\nA review of records added to Virtual VA indicates that the Veteran was hospitalized for psychiatric problems at the Montgomery VA Medical Center (VAMC) in August 2011.  The diagnoses included bipolar disorder and PTSD.  The Board notes that this additional evidence was not before the August 2010 VA examiner when he rendered his opinion.  Consequently, on remand, the VA examiner should be asked to review and consider this additional evidence and provide a supplemental medical opinion. \r\n\r\nThe AMC should obtain and associate with the claims file all outstanding VA treatment records.  The Board emphasizes that records generated by VA facilities that may have an impact on the adjudication of a claim are considered constructively in the possession of VA adjudicators during the consideration of a claim, regardless of whether those records are physically on file.  See Dunn v. West, 11 Vet. App. 462, 466-67 (1998); Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611, 613 (1992).  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  Provide the Veteran with a copy of the November 2010 SSOC to his current address of record.\r\n\r\n2.  Obtain clinical records from the Central Alabama HCS dated from December 2009 to the present, including hospitalization records from the Montgomery VAMC.  All records/responses received should be associated with the claims file.  \r\n\r\n3.  Schedule the Veteran for an examination.  After a thorough review of the evidence of record, to include VA hospitalization records dated in August 2011, the examiner is asked to identify the Veteran's current psychiatric disorders.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner is asked to specifically note whether the Veteran meets the criteria for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner is then asked to render an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (a 50 percent probability or greater) that any current psychiatric disorder(s) was/were manifested during or otherwise caused by the Veteran's active duty or any incident therein?  The examiner should provide a complete rationale for his/her opinion. \r\n\r\nThe entire claims file, to include a complete copy of this REMAND, must be made available to the examiner designated to examine the Veteran, and the report of the examination should include discussion of the Veteran's documented medical history and assertions.  \r\n\r\nAll appropriate tests and studies should be accomplished (with all results made available to the physician prior to the completion of his or her report) and all clinical findings should be reported in detail. \r\n\r\nThe examiner should set forth all examination findings (if any), along with complete rationale for the opinion provided, in a printed (typewritten) report. \r\n\r\n4.  After completing the requested action, and any additional notification and/or development deemed warranted, the RO should adjudicate the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder in light of all pertinent evidence and legal authority.  \r\n\r\nIf the benefit sought on appeal remains denied, the RO must furnish to the Veteran a SSOC and afford him an appropriate time period for response before the claims file is returned to the Board for further appellate consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Kordich, Senior Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from November 1964 to November 1992.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision dated in July 2009 by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Winston-Salem North Carolina.\r\n\r\nA review of the Virtual VA paperless claims processing system does not reveal any additional documents pertinent to the present appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's currently demonstrated sleep apnea was caused by his service-connected PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131, 1154, 5107(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.310 (2011). \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nDuty to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000), defines the obligations of VA with respect to the duty to assist and includes an enhanced duty to notify a claimant as to the information and evidence necessary to substantiate a claim for VA benefits.  \r\n\r\nFirst, VA has a duty to notify the Veteran of any information and evidence needed to substantiate and complete a claim.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5102, 5103 (West 2002 & Supp. 2011); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) (2011).  Second, VA has a duty to assist the Veteran in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate a claim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c).  \r\n\r\nAs discussed in detail below, sufficient evidence is of record to grant the matter on appeal.  Therefore, no further notice or development is needed with respect to this matter.  The Board notes that the Veteran was advised in a January 2009 letter of the information and evidence necessary to substantiate the initial rating and effective date in the event his claim was successful.  See Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).\r\n\r\nService Connection Criteria \r\n\r\nService connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a). \r\n\r\nEstablishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table); see also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303. \r\n\r\nUnder 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b), an alternative method of establishing the second and third Shedden/Caluza element is through a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); see Savage v. Grober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 495-97 (1997); see also Clyburn v. West, 12 Vet. App. 296, 302 (1999).  Continuity of symptomatology may be established if a claimant can demonstrate (1) that a condition was \"noted\" during service; (2) evidence of post-service continuity of the same symptomatology; and (3) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptomatology.  Savage, 10 Vet. App. at 495-96; see Hickson, 12 Vet. App. at 253 (lay evidence of in-service incurrence sufficient in some circumstances for purposes of establishing service connection); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b). \r\n\r\nIn relevant part, 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(a) requires that VA give \"due consideration\" to \"all pertinent medical and lay evidence\" in evaluating a claim for disability or death benefits.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009). \r\n\r\nThe ordinary meaning of the phrase \"engaged in combat with the enemy,\" as used in 38 U.S.C. � 1154(b), requires that a veteran have participated in events constituting an actual fight or encounter with a military foe or hostile unit or instrumentality. The issue of whether any particular set of circumstances constitutes engagement in combat with the enemy for purposes of section 1154(b) must be resolved on a case-by-case basis.  See VAOPGCPREC 12-99. \r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that \"[l]ay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical profession.\"  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (\"[T]he Board cannot determine that lay evidence lacks credibility merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.\" \r\n\r\n\"Symptoms, not treatment, are the essence of any evidence of continuity of symptomatology.\"  Savage, 10 Vet. App. at 496 (citing Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 16, 19 (1991).  Once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994) (distinguishing between competency (\"a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered\") and credibility (\"a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted\"). \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  Presumptive periods are not intended to limit service connection to diseases so diagnosed when the evidence warrants direct service connection.  The presumptive provisions of the statute and VA regulations implementing them are intended as liberalizations applicable when the evidence would not warrant service connection without their aid.  38 C.F.R. �� 3.303(d), 3.307, 3.309. \r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted for a disorder found to be proximately due to, or the result of, a service connected disability, including on the basis of aggravation.  Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995); 38 C.F.R. � 3.310.  The Board notes that the revisions to 38 C.F.R. � 3.310 were effective in October 10, 2006, prior to the filing of the Veteran's claim. \r\n\r\nUnder the current version of 38 C.F.R. � 3.310, VA will not concede such aggravation unless the baseline level of severity of the non-service connected disease or injury is established by medical evidence created before the onset of aggravation and by the earliest medical evidence created at any time between the onset of aggravation and the receipt of medical evidence establishing the current level of severity of the non-service connected disease or injury.  The RO will determine the baseline and current levels of severity under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (rating schedule) and determine the extent of aggravation by deducting the baseline level of severity as well as any increase in severity due to the natural progress of the disease, from the current level.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310(a). \r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that his service-connected PTSD has caused or aggravated his obstructive sleep apnea.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records contain no mention of treatment for or reports of sleep apnea.  Throughout service, the Veteran reported that he was not currently experiencing and did not have a history of sleep disturbances.  The Veteran reported a history of sinusitis throughout service and was treated intermittently for respiratory infections with no lingering effects or sleep apnea noted.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.\r\n\r\nService connection is currently in effect for PTSD, which is evaluated as 70 percent disabling with an effective date of January 30, 2007.\r\n\r\nThe record clearly indicates that the Veteran has been diagnosed with sleep apnea.  See, e.g. August 31, 1999 VA outpatient treatment records.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran submitted a September 2008 letter from his private physician, Dr. H.J., in which Dr. H.J. stated that there was a connection between the Veteran's PTSD and sleep apnea.  To support this opinion, the physician stated, \"PTSD might not cause sleep apnea but might exacerbate the symptom, because there are more rapid eye movement (REM) sleeps in PTSD and because the apnea episodes happen during the REM sleep due to decrease in the muscle tone in airway.  We can argue that PTSD worsens the sleep apnea.\"  \r\n\r\nA June 2009 VA compensation and pension examiner offered a negative opinion in this case, but did offer rationale for that opinion.  The VA examiner stated that he reviewed the private physician's opinion, but believed that PTSD has not been identified as a cause of obstructive sleep apnea in peer-reviewed accepted medical literature.  The VA examiner also stated that there was no documentation of sleep apnea in the Veteran's service medical records.  See Nieves-Rodriquez v Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008) (finding that the probative value of a medical opinion is measured by factual accuracy, full articulation, and sound reasoning, not by the mere fact that the claims file was reviewed).  \r\n\r\nIn May 2011, the Board remanded the matter for an adequate medical opinion to be obtained regarding whether the Veteran's sleep apnea was caused or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD, with an explanation for the basis of the medical opinion.  The Board requested that all evidence in the claims file be reviewed, to include the opinion offered by Dr. H.J.\r\n\r\nAt a December 2011 VA examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran was diagnosed with sleep apnea after a sleep study in 1999 and obstructive sleep apnea in a sleep study in 2010.  The examiner explained that he was a psychologist, and as such could not speak to whether sleep apnea was caused or aggravated by PTSD.  The examiner explained that he therefore consulted a medical doctor, who added remarks to the report.  The Veteran stated that he did not sleep well after Vietnam, and that after several years, he was given a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device in 1999, which improved his sleep and made him feel calmer when he used it.  The Veteran stated that he would sleep during lunch while he worked as he had difficulty sleeping at night.  He stated that his wife has reported that he continued to stop breathing at night.  The Veteran's wife reported that he did not sleep and did not allow her to sleep.  She stated he gets up all night and the least little sound he will jump up and if she does not hear what he hears he gets very frustrated with her.\r\n\r\nThe medical doctor opined that the condition/disability of sleep apnea was not caused by, a result of, or aggravated by the Veteran's service connected PTSD.  It was noted that the records were reviewed and the case was discussed with the examining psychologist.  The physician stated the preponderance of the available medical and psychological knowledge does not support PTSD causing obstructive sleep apnea.  The physician noted that obstructive sleep apnea is a physical illness which is not caused by or aggravated by PTSD. \r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nThe Board initially notes that the Veteran does not contend, and the record does not show that the Veteran's sleep apnea originated in service.  The Veteran served in combat, but does not contend that he was treated for sleep apnea or any associated symptoms while in service.  The record shows he was first diagnosed as having sleep apnea many years after service, and he does not allege that he or others noticed any symptoms of sleep apnea until years after service.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends instead that his service-connected PTSD caused or aggravated his sleep apnea.  Dr. H.J. suggested that there was no direct causal relationship between the two disorders, and the June 2009 and December 2011 VA examiners agreed.  Dr. H.J. did, however, conclude that the Veteran's PTSD worsened the sleep apnea, and provided a rationale in support of his conclusion.  \r\n\r\nThe June 2009 VA examiner did not address whether the PTSD may have aggravated the sleep apnea; he limited his opinion to the matter of direct causation.  The December 2011 VA examiner did address the matter of aggravation.  He concluded that the PTSD did not worsen the sleep apnea, apparently with the sole rationale that sleep apnea is a physical illness, whereas PTSD is a mental illness.\r\n\r\nAn evaluation of the probative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the medical expert's personal examination of the patient, the examiner's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion reached.  The credibility and weight to be attached to such opinions are within the province of the Board as adjudicators.  Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467 (1993). \r\n\r\nGreater weight may be placed on one physician's opinion over another depending on factors such as reasoning employed by the physicians and whether or not and the extent to which they reviewed prior clinical records and other evidence.  Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36 (1994).  The probative value of a medical opinion is generally based on the scope of the examination or review, as well as the relative merits of the expert's qualifications and analytical findings, and the probative weight of a medical opinion may be reduced if the examiner fails to explain the basis for an opinion.  Sklar v. Brown, 5 Vet. App, 140 (1993).\r\n\r\nIn this case, and on the matter of aggravation of the sleep apnea, the Board is unable to assign greater probative weight to either Dr. H.J.'s opinion, or to the opinion of the December 2011 VA examiner.  Both examiners are medical professionals, and both have offered rationales in support of their conclusions.  Neither rationale is clearly more persuasive.  Dr. H.J. based his conclusion on the notion that PTSD causes increased REM sleep, which is the type of sleep during which apneas tend to occur.  It is unclear, however, how this necessarily establishes that the underlying sleep apnea has worsened.  The December 2011 examiner concluded that there was no aggravation of the sleep apnea by PTSD, but his rationale appears to rely on the notion that a physical disorder cannot be aggravated by a mental disorder.  That notion is, as a categorical statement, rather questionable.\r\n\r\nIn short, the Board finds that the evidence is in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's PTSD aggravated the sleep apnea.  Accordingly, service connection on a secondary basis for sleep apnea is granted.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102 (2011); see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\nThe Board notes in passing that although 38 C.F.R. �3.310(b) indicates that VA will not concede aggravation unless the baseline severity of the nonservice-connected disease or injury is established, the next sentence indicates that the rating activity will determine the baseline and current levels of severity and determine the extent of aggravation.  Given that the Board is not bound by the RO's determination that aggravation is not present, and as the Board does not assign ratings in the first instance, the Board reads 38 C.F.R. �3.310(b) as permitting the Board to determine whether service connection on an aggravation basis is warranted, with the RO having the responsibility for determining the degree of aggravation in assigning the rating.  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nCHERYL L.

Hughes, Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty from July 1961 to July 1963.  This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from January 2006 and November 2007 rating decisions of the Houston, Texas, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which, respectively, denied service connection for depression/alcoholism and for PTSD.  In September 2009, a videoconference hearing was held before the undersigned.  A transcript of the hearing is associated with the Veteran's claims file.  The case was before the Board in November 2009 and November 2011, when it was remanded for additional development.  In January 2011, the Board sought an advisory medical opinion from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nWhile the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD are not met, it is reasonably shown that the Veteran has a depressive disorder which had its onset in service; an alcohol abuse disability is not shown during the pendency of this claim.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\n1.  Service connection for depressive disorder is warranted.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3,304 (2011) \r\n\r\n2.  Service connection for PTSD and alcohol abuse is not warranted.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3.310, 3.304, 4.125 (2011).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nThe VCAA, in part, describes VA's duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a).  The VCAA applies to the instant claim. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was advised of VA's duties to notify and assist in the development of his claims prior to their initial adjudication.  An April 2005 letter explained the evidence necessary to substantiate his claims and a September 2006 letter explained the evidence specifically necessary to substantiate a claim for PTSD.  These letters also notified the Veteran of the evidence VA is responsible for providing and the evidence the Veteran is responsible for providing.  The September 2006 letter also informed the Veteran of disability rating and effective date criteria.  He has had ample opportunity to respond/supplement the record, and has not alleged that notice in this case was less than adequate. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are unavailable and were presumably destroyed by a fire at the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1973.  Therefore, VA has a heightened duty to assist him in developing his claims.  O'Hare v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 365 (1991).  The Veteran's service personnel records are associated with the claims file and pertinent postservice treatment records, have been secured.  The RO arranged for VA examinations/medical opinions in connection with the Veteran's claims in January 2006, October 2010, and January 2012 and the examiners specifically stated that they reviewed the claims folders or the available records, obtained a reported history from the Veteran and conducted a thorough examination in connection with the medical opinions provided.  In May 2011, the Board sought a VHA medical advisory opinion based on a review of the complete record.\r\n\r\nNotably, the Veteran argues that the examinations and opinions by VA psychologists D.P. (October 2010) and J.B. (Janauary 2012) should be \"thrown out and dismissed.\"  (See January 25, 2012; March 22, 2012; July 21, 2012; July 31, 2012; and August 13, 2012 letters from the Veteran.)  The Veteran has generally questioned their competency to examine him and argues that these examiners have engaged in \"contempt prior to investigation\".  In the August 2012 letter he requested evaluation by a psychiatrist.  The Board notes that the October 2010 and January 2012 VA examination reports reflect a thorough review of the Veteran's claims file and the findings reported are detailed.  Nevertheless, the Board found the October 2010 examination report incomplete and secured a VHA medical advisory opinion.  Furthermore, pursuant to the recommendation of the VHA examiner, the Board remanded the matter for another, January 2012, VA examination.  To the extent that any earlier VA examination was inadequate in some respect, subsequent examinations have rectified the problem.  Hence, the Board finds that the examination reports/opinions by VA psychologists D.P. and J.B., considered cumulatively with the VHA opinion, are adequate (and responsive to the questions posed by the Board's 2009 and 2011 remands).  They reflect familiarity with the Veteran's medical history, note his contentions, and include explanation of rationale with citation to the factual evidence in the record.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (VA must provide an examination that is adequate for rating purposes).  As the examinations and opinions are by healthcare professionals (who are trained to diagnose and determine the etiology of the disabilities at issue and qualified to provide the opinions sought), as the medical questions posed are not of a complexity beyond the competence of a psychologist, and as both psychologists thoroughly explained the rationale for the opinions given, the Board finds that the opinions of the October 2010 and January 2012 examiners (together with the advisory VHA opinion) are both probative and substantially compliant with the Board's remand instructions.  Therefore, return of the matter for strict compliance with the remands is not required.  See Cox v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 563, 569 (2007) (VA may satisfy its duty to assist by providing a medical examination conducted by someone who is able to provide \"competent medical evidence\" under 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(a)(1)).  The Veteran has not identified any pertinent evidence that remains outstanding.  Accordingly, the Board finds that VA's duty to assist is met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFactual Background\r\n\r\nThe Veteran claims that he developed a psychiatric disorder, alleged to be PTSD and depression, from serving at Plattsburgh Air Force Base (a SAC base) from January 1962 to July 1963 during the Cuban Missile Crisis (CMC).  He also claims that his heavy drinking started during his time in the military and that he has alcoholism secondary to PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's written communications and hearing testimony include his recollection that he saw a base psychiatrist and a chaplain prior to service discharge.  He recalls that he was fearful that there was a possibility of the end of life on earth because there were several times when it was believed that it was imminent that the U.S. was going to launch bombers toward the Soviet Union.  The Veteran recalls that they were told that, if the aircraft were launched, the Soviets would retaliate with nuclear weapons. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's DD Form 214, reflects that his last duty assignment and major command was with the 497th Field Maintenance Squadron (SAC) at Plattsburgh AFB, NY, and his military occupational specialty was aircraft missile pneudraulic repairman.  As was noted above, the Veteran's STRs are presumed to have been lost in a 1973 fire at the NPRC in St. Louis, Missouri.  However, his alleged stressful event has been acknowledged (and is not in dispute).  \r\n\r\nThe record shows that the Veteran has received VA and private mental health treatment, including for alcohol abuse.  A 1977 Hospital Summary notes that he sought treatment for excessive anxiety, depression and excessive use of alcohol.  It was also noted that he had been working as a prison psychologist until a few weeks prior, was divorced, and had sought professional help in the past without success.  A 1980 VA Hospital Summary notes that the Veteran is a psychologist and reported that his \"primary diagnosis is alcoholism.\"  He also reported a long history of alcohol abuse dating back to 1967, precipitated by a divorce from his first wife.  The diagnoses included alcohol dependency and major depressive illness secondary to alcohol.  The Veteran has reported, and the record shows, that he has been \"sober\" since 1980 (See April 24, 2010 letter.)\r\nA September 2005 statement by a former fellow service member reports that he served together with the Veteran at Plattsburgh AFB, New York during 1962-1963 (when they both worked on aircraft, shared the same barracks, and were friends and buddies), and recalls that a few months prior to discharge the Veteran saw a psychiatrist at the base hospital on a couple of occasions with complaints of depression and alcohol abuse.  The fellow former service member also states that, shortly prior to discharge, the Veteran's shop chief took him to see the base chaplain and possibly the base psychiatrist to discuss depression.  \r\n\r\nOn January 2006 VA Mental Disorders examination, the diagnoses were depressive disorder, NOS; major depressive disorder (by history); and alcohol abuse, in sustained remission.  (The Veteran reported he had had no alcohol for 25 years and showed the examiner his \"chip from the AA Group, indicating that he had not drank in 25 years.\")  The examination report also includes the opinion that the Veteran's depressive disorder NOS is at least as likely as not related to the depression [he reported was] treated in service.  The examiner explained that, \"looking over the years, it seems very likely that the depression noted in service and the reaction to the frightening situation of a possible war with Russia was an indicator of a depression that had likely been there and would continue to be over the years and would likely encourage the excessive use of alcohol, mood swings and other symptoms.  The terror experienced by the Veteran when he realized the possible reality of imminent war with Russia likely helped potentiate his depression, which then continued to be a dysfunctional aspect of his make-up over the ensuing years.\"  [Notably, this examiner indicated that the Veteran's service medical records (STRs) were reviewed; as is noted above, the Veteran's STRs are unavailable.]  \r\n\r\nAn April 2006 letter from a private physician, R.R.C., M.D., states that the Veteran suffers from PTSD and alcohol abuse in remission.  \r\n\r\nA May 2006 letter from a private physician, R.M.T., M.D., lists diagnoses of PTSD, related alcohol abuse in remission, and depression.  The letter also includes the statement (with no further explanation) that PTSD \"may be service related\".  \r\n\r\nA September 2007 statement by the Veteran's treating psychologist, B.A.K., PhD, (Dr. K), lists a diagnosis of PTSD with related alcohol abuse and dependence (sober for 27 years).  Although this diagnosis appears to be in accordance with DSM-IV, the findings and opinion of the examiner are based on the history reported by the Veteran rather than a review of the medical evidence (including the 1980 VA Hospital Summary) which contradict some of his reports.  \r\n\r\nOn October 2010 VA examination the diagnoses were major depressive disorder, recurrent, in remisison and alcohol abuse in sustained remission.  The examiner opined:  (1) The Veteran does not currently report symptoms that would meet criteria for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder.  Therefore, his symptoms appear to be in remission.  (2)  Regarding PTSD, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's being in the military during the Cuban Missile Crisis would not, in and of itself, meet the criteria for DSM 4 TR criterion A stressor.  Regardless, he did not report other symptoms that would be suggestive of a diagnosis of PTSD.  Specifically, he did not report symptoms of avoidance and numbing, increased arousal, or re-experiencing.  (3) It does not appear at any point the Veteran's symptoms of depression were due to or caused by his military service.  Regarding the PTSD stressor, the examiner noted that the Veteran reported being fearful; however, he did not report reactions that would be suggestive of a criterion A stressor.  Specifically, he did not report fearing for his own life or witnessing any other tragic or traumatic event that would qualify as a PTSD stressor.  The Veteran was not exposed to, and did not experience, actual death or loss of integrity of self or others.  The examiner noted that it could be argued that the Veteran was frightened of threatened death or serious injury; however, there was no indication that his response at the time was marked by intense fear or helplessness, or any other indication of disorganized or agitated behavior.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's response did not appear out of context to what was experienced globally during that time.  \r\n\r\nIn a December 2010 letter, the Dr. K reiterated his finding that the stressor experienced by the Veteran during his military service meets the criteria for a traumatic event.  \r\n\r\nIn January 2011, the Board (finding that the October 2010 VA opinion did not explain the rationale for disagreement with the opinion of the Veteran's treating psychologist and made no reference to the opinion of the January 2006 VA examiner relating the Veteran's current depressive disorder to his military service) requested an advisory medical opinion from a VHA expert in this matter.  In May 2011, a VA expert (who is an Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania) conducted a detailed review of the Veteran's complete claims file and (1) opined that the Veteran's current psychiatric diagnosis is:  \r\n\r\nAxis I:  Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (NOS), rule out Major depressive disorder (MDD) in remission versus substance-induced mood disorder in remission; alcohol dependence in remission; rule out post-traumatic stress disorder (see answer to question 2, below); rule out anxiety disorder NOS in remission.  The term \"rule out\" is used to clarify those diagnoses for which the evidence is not sufficient to warrant a definitive diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThe medical expert explained:\r\n\r\nI cannot clarify if the depression is secondary to the alcohol abuse or whether it is a separate diagnosis.  This is because the more recent treatment notes and C&Ps [VA examination reports] (which note the depressive symptoms in remission) occurred after the patient became sober, and the notes that document current depressive symptoms (the discharge summary from 1980) also document concomitant alcohol dependence.  The patient states that he is stable on anti-depressant medication, but if he were to stop the medication, the depression would return.  This would suggest a separate mood disorder, but it cannot be confirmed by treatment notes.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the patient's chart, I cannot rule in or out the diagnosis of anxiety disorder NOS.  It is mentioned in Dr. [K's] initial note of 06/06/2007 under the diagnosis.  The C&P of 2010 mentions that there was a history of panic attacks and current symptom of worrying, but there is not enough information about the extent of the worrying, or other symptoms that would clarify an anxiety disorder.  In the C&P of 2006, the patient answered he had no history of panic attacks, and no significant anxiety.\r\n\r\nRegarding PTSD, the medical expert opined that, unlike the October 2010 opinion of the VA psychologist, it \"is my medical opinion that the trauma the patient underwent during the CMC would qualify as a traumatic event under criterion A, thus allowing a PTSD evaluation to proceed;\" however, criterion B/C/D (symptoms of reexperiencing/avoidance/arousal) \"is where the record is nearly completely lacking in diagnostic detail.\"  The medical expert considered the letter from Dr. K in support of the Veteran's claim and opined that:\r\n\r\nDr. [K's] letter did not help clarify a diagnosis of PTSD.  He was vague with diagnostic terms, and at times used them incorrectly (e.g. sense of foreshortened future being related to his fear of job termination).  Most of the avoidance symptoms Dr. [K] notes are related to the patient avoiding people at his work with whom he has interpersonal difficulties.  This is not what the PTSD diagnostic criteria mean by avoidance.  There are no details on symptoms of increased arousal, just a listing of the DSM symptom category without description.  His description of the re-experiencing symptoms is vague and does not help clarify diagnosis (e.g. \"he has been acting and feeling as if the traumatic event were recurring\".  What does that mean?  Is he having flashbacks?  Intrusive memories?  What are his actions?  What are his feelings?).\r\n\r\nThe VHA expert further explained that, with the exception of noting \"a history of relationship instability resulting in 4 marriages,\" symptoms that we would expect to see with PTSD are noticeably absent from the January 2006 VA examination report (which was conducted prior to the Veteran's PTSD claim).  \"[I]n particular: sleep disturbance, nightmares, anxiety or anxiety attacks, anger outbursts, irritability, social avoidance.\"  \r\n\r\nUpon review of Dr. K's case notes, VA treatment records and examination reports and the Veteran's written statements, the medical expert concluded that \"the stressor is sufficient to meet criterion A\" but \"there is insufficient evidence in the chart of convincing and well-documented PTSD symptoms to make an even 50% probability diagnosis of PTSD\" and suggested that another VA PTSD examination would provide the diagnostic data required to confirm the diagnosis.  \r\n\r\nRegarding the etiology of the psychiatric diagnoses other than PTSD, the medical expert (1) reiterated the opinion of the January 2006 VA examiner that the Veteran's \"depressive disorder NOS is at least as likely as not a result of the stress he experienced during the military\" and noted that his \"depressive symptoms are currently in remission\" (2) noted that, according to the patient and his buddy statements, he began drinking heavily after the CMC, despite the discharge summary from 1980, which states that his alcohol abuse began after the dissolution of his first marriage and (3) the diagnosis of anxiety disorder NOS cannot be confirmed by the record.  \r\n\r\nPursuant to the recommendation of the VHA medical expert, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in January 2012 to ascertain whether he meets the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.  The examiner reviewed the Veteran's claims file, electronic medical records, and the VHA opinion and opined that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of PTSD.  His current diagnoses were identified as depressive disorder NOS in remission and alcohol dependence in full sustained remission.  The examiner opined that the trauma the Veteran experienced during the CMC was sufficient to meet criterion A (traumatic event); however, although the Veteran experienced hypervigilance (criterion D), the event was not persistently reexperienced and there was no persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma or numbing of general responsiveness (criteria B and C).  The examiner opined that the Veteran therefore did not meet the full criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD and explained:\r\n\r\nOne could concretely construe the event experienced as meeting Criterion A as the veteran was exposed to the potential of a traumatic event that would have involved threatened death or serious injury if it had come about, and he responded to the potential threat with fear.  Regardless, however, the veteran still would not meet criteria for the diagnosis of PTSD because he is not persistently re-experiencing the event, he does not have persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the \"trauma\" or numbing of general responsiveness, nor does he have persistent symptoms of increased arousal.\r\n\r\nThe examiner noted that the Veteran \"made it clear that he was a licensed psychologist and knew the symptoms of PTSD,\" \"is quite invested in receiving a diagnosis of PTSD,\" and \"believes that he fulfills criteria for PTSD;\" however, the Veteran \"tended to ascribe to symptoms that on further inquiry he did not have.\"  The examiner opined that \"the veteran does not meet criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.  He has a history of Depressive Disorder NOS which (currently in remission with medication) that [sic] does not appear to be related to his military service.\"\r\n\r\nLegal Criteria and Analysis\r\n\r\nInitially, Board notes that it has reviewed all of the evidence of record, to include in the Veteran's claims file and in Virtual VA, with an emphasis on the evidence relevant to this appeal.  (The Virtual VA file does not contain any evidence pertinent to the matter at hand.)  Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, every piece of evidence of record.  Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (VA must review the entire record, but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence).  Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence as appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claims.\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability due to disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  A disorder may be service connected if the evidence of record shows that the veteran currently has a disorder that was chronic in service or, if not chronic, that was seen in service with continuity of symptomatology demonstrated thereafter.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b).  A demonstration of continuity of symptomatology is an alternative method of demonstrating the second and/or third elements discussed above.  See Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 495-96 (1997).  Service connection also may be granted for [a disease] initially diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that it was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (d).\r\n\r\nIn order to prevail on the issue of service connection, there must be medical evidence of a current disability; medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury.  See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247 (1999).  The determination as to whether these requirements are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and an evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).\r\n\r\nService connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability that is proximately due to, or the result of, or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury.  Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires: (1) Competent evidence (a medical diagnosis) of a current disability (for which secondary service connection is sought); (2) evidence of a service connected disability; and (3) competent evidence that the current disability was either caused or aggravated by the service connected disability.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310(a); see also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995)(en banc).  \r\n\r\nIn rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.  See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990). \r\n\r\nCompetency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  The former is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while the latter is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted.  Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) (\"although interest may affect the credibility of testimony, it does not affect competency to testify\").\r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b).  When all of the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether a fair preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990).\r\n\r\nThe record shows that the Veteran has a diagnosis of recurring depressive disorder.  While it is described as in remission, the fact that medication is required to maintain remission establishes that there is such disability.  Lay evidence (which the Board finds no reason to question as not credible) corroborates that he saw a base psychiatrist and chaplain prior to service discharge.  What he must still show to establish service connection for a depressive disorder is that it is related to his service/complaints therein.\r\n\r\nThe record includes both medical evidence that tends to support the Veteran's claim of service connection for a depressive disorder and medical evidence that is against his claim.  When evaluating medical opinions, the Board may place greater weight on one medical professional's opinion over another's depending on factors such as reasoning employed by the medical professionals, and whether or not and to what extent they review prior clinical records and other evidence.  See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App, 36 (1994).  \r\n\r\nThe evidence that tends to support the Veteran's claim consists of the January 2006 VA Mental Disorders examination report and the VHA medical expert opinion.  Of the various opinions supporting and against the Veteran's claim, only the January 2006 VA opinion contains an explanation of rationale and the examiner, a psychologist, is qualified, by virtue of training and experience, to provide such opinion in the matter.  [Notwithstanding the statement by the examiner that the Veteran's STRs, which are not available for review, were reviewed; the basis for the opinion (that the CMC represented a traumatic event and that the Veteran received psychiatric treatment in service) has been corroborated.]  Furthermore, the VHA medical expert reiterated the January 2006 opinion, albeit without comment; thereby endorsing it.  Accordingly, the opinions of the January 2006 VA examiner and the VHA medical expert are highly probative evidence in this matter.  \r\n\r\nThe evidence against the Veteran's claim includes the October 2010 and January 2012 VA examination reports which provide opinions that the Veteran's depression was not due to or caused by his military service.  These examination reports provide no explanation of rationale for the opinion offered and therefore may be accorded little probative weight.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the requirements for establishing service connection are met as to the diagnosis of depressive disorder.  \r\n\r\nRegarding the diagnosis of PTSD, the threshold question that must be addressed here (as with any claim seeking service connection) is whether the Veteran actually has the disability for which service connection is sought, i.e. PTSD.  In the absence of proof of a present disability, there is no valid claim of service connection.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a), i.e., a diagnosis conforming to DSM-IV; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link, or causal nexus, between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nEffective July 13, 2010, VA amended its regulations governing service connection for PTSD by liberalizing, in certain circumstances, the evidentiary standard for establishing the required in-service stressor.  See 75 Fed. Reg. 39843 (July 13, 2010).  Inasmuch as the occurrence or the alleged stressor event is not in dispute, the amended regulation has no bearing in this matter.\r\nThe \"positive\" evidence regarding a diagnosis of PTSD includes the April 2006 and May 2006 letters from the Veteran's private physicians, Drs. R.R.C. and R.M.T., and statements from his treating psychologist, Dr. K., which assign him a diagnosis of PTSD.  Furthermore, the May 2011 VHA medical expert opinion includes a diagnosis of \"rule out PTSD\" (which acknowledges that the trauma the Veteran experienced during the CMC would qualify as a traumatic event, but questions whether he experiences symptoms of reexperiencing, avoidance, and arousal so as to meet the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD).  The \"positive\" evidence also includes the Veteran's own statements that he has PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe \"negative\" evidence regarding a diagnosis of PTSD consists of opinions by VA psychologists in October 2010 (that the CMC stressor did not qualify as a tramatic event) and January 2012 (that the CMC stressor qualified as a traumatic event; however, there was no persistent reexperiencing of the event or persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma or numbing of general responsiveness).  \r\n\r\nIn evaluating medical opinions, the Board may place greater weight on one medical professional's opinion over another's depending on factors such as reasoning employed by the medical professionals, and whether or not and to what extent they review prior clinical records and other evidence.  See Gabrielson, 7 Vet. App. 36 (1994).  \r\n\r\nIn weighing the respective medical opinions, the Board concludes that the January 2012 VA examiner's opinion merits the most probative weight.  As the opinion is accompanied by expression of a more complete awareness of the Veteran's medical history and clinical data, discusses all DSM-IV criteria necessary for a diagnosis of PTSD, includes a detailed explanation of the rationale for the opinion (identifying the specific symptoms found lacking for a diagnosis of PTSD), and the examiner comments on the other opinions already of record, the Board finds this opinion more probative than the essentially bare conclusions of the April 2006 and May 2006 statements from the Veteran's private physicians.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD because he is not persistently re-experiencing the event and he does not have persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the \"trauma\" or numbing of general responsiveness.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the opinion of Dr. K. provides a diagnosis of PTSD and appears to be in accordance with DSM-IV, it is based on a history reported by the Veteran rather than a review of the medical evidence (including the 1980 VA Hospital Summary) which contradict some of his reports.  Moreover, the VHA medical expert considered Dr. K.'s statements in support of the Veteran's claim and concluded that the statements were \"vague with diagnostic terms, and at times used them incorrectly.\"  Furthermore, while the April 2006 and May 2006 letters from the Veteran's private physicians offer a diagnosis of PTSD, the letters do not identify the stressor on which such diagnosis is based or report the presence of the symptoms required for a diagnosis of PTSD in accordance with DSM-IV, as required under 38 C.F.R. � 4.125.  Thus, the Board finds little probative value in the April 2006 and May 2006 letters from the Veteran's private physicians and statements from his treating psychologist, Dr. K.\r\n\r\nThe October 2010 opinion of the VA examiner that the CMC stressor did not qualify as a traumatic event is outweighed in probative value by the opinions of the VHA medical expert (who is an Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania) and January 2012 VA examiner, who provided detailed explanation for the opinion that the CMC stressor qualifies as a traumatic event.  \r\n\r\nThe Board considered the Veteran's statements regarding the existence of PTSD and notes that he is a psychologist (and thus competent to opine regarding a diagnosis of PTSD).  However, the Board finds that while he is competent to offer an opinion regarding a diagnosis of PTSD, the opinion is lacking in probative value because it is based on his statements which are not credible.  Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 470; see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 510-511 (1995) (\"Credibility can be genuinely evaluated by a showing of interest, bias, or inconsistent statements, and the demeanor of the witness, official plausibility of the testimony, and the consistency of the witness' testimony\").  His accounts of experiencing symptoms required for a diagnosis of PTSD in accordance with DSM-IV are self-serving, compensation driven and inconsistent with the medical evidence.  See Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999) (although Board must take into consideration the appellant's statements, it may consider whether self-interest may be a factor in making such statements).  Many of his self-reported symptoms were first reported upon his filing a claim seeking service connection.  \r\n\r\nIn summary, the preponderance of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran has PTSD.  Consequently, he has not presented a valid claim of service connection for such disability.  See Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Veteran claims that his heavy drinking started during his time in the military and that he has alcoholism due to PTSD.  \r\n\r\nSection 8052 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-508, � 8052, 104 Stat. 1388, 1388-91, prohibits, effective for claims filed after October 31, 1990, payment of compensation for a disability that is a result of a veteran's own alcohol or drug abuse.  Moreover, Section 8052 also amended 38 U.S.C.A. � 105(a) to provide that, with respect to claims filed after October 31, 1990, an injury or disease incurred during active service will not be deemed to have been incurred in line of duty if the injury or disease was a result of the person's own willful misconduct, including abuse of alcohol or drugs.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 105; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.1(m), 3.301(d). \r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has held that compensation cannot be awarded pursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131 and 38 C.F.R. � 105(a) either for a primary alcohol abuse disability incurred during service or for any secondary disability that resulted from primary alcohol abuse during service.  Allen v. Principi, 237 F.3d 1368, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  However, service connection may be granted for an alcohol or drug abuse disability acquired secondary to or as a symptom of service-connected disability.  The Federal Circuit further stated that such compensation may be awarded only \"where there is clear medical evidence establishing that alcohol or drug abuse is caused by a veteran's primary service-connected disability, and where the alcohol or drug abuse disability is not due to willful wrongdoing.\"  See Allen, 237 F. 3d at 1381.\r\n\r\nRegardless, the threshold question in this matter is whether or not the Veteran has the claimed disability for which service connection is sought (an alcohol abuse disorder), for without evidence of current (at any time during the pendency of the claim.  See McClain, 21 Vet. App. at 321) disability there is no valid claim of service connection.  See Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225.  The evidence shows that the Veteran has a remote history of alcohol abuse.  However, undisputed evidence reflects he has been sober since 1980, i.e. for decades prior to his instant claim of service connection.  On January 2006 VA Mental Disorders examination it was noted that he reported having had no alcohol for 25 years and that his alcohol abuse has been in \"sustained remission.\"  Subsequent medical evidence shows that his alcoholism has remained in remission.  Consequently, he has not presented a valid claim of service connection for an alcohol abuse disability, and such claim must be denied.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (38 U.S.C.A. � 1131, as well as other relevant statutes, only permit payment for disabilities existing on and after the date of application for such disorders.)  \r\n\r\n[The Board observes incidentally that any claim of service connection for alcoholism as secondary to a diagnosis of PTSD lacks legal merit, as a threshold legal requirement for substantiating such claim (that the primary disability on which a claim of secondary service connection is based must be service connected) is not met.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).]\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\n\r\nService connection depressive disorder is granted.\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD and alcohol abuse is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nGeorge R.

C. Dale, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active duty service from October 1978 to May 1979 and January 1983 to June 1983.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2006 and November 2007 rating decisions by the Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in Denver, Colorado, that denied service connection for PTSD and for generalized anxiety disorder, major depression, and a panic disorder, respectively.  Jurisdiction has been transferred to the RO in Montgomery, Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe Board remanded the appeal for a hearing in May 2012.  The Veteran was afforded a July 2012 videoconference hearing before the undersigned.  A transcript of the hearing is associated with claims folder.  \r\n\r\nDuring the pendency of the appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has ruled that a claim for a psychiatric disorder encompasses all psychiatric diagnoses raised by the record.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  Hence, the issue has been recharacterized as a single issue for service connection that encompasses all the psychiatric diagnoses raised by the record.  \r\n\r\nA review of the Virtual VA paperless claims processing system does not show any pertinent records that are not already associated with the physical claims folder.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The Veteran has provided consistent reports of two episodes of in-service sexual trauma; she necessitated emergency room treatment for hyperventilation shortly after the episodes of assault.  \r\n\r\n2.  The Veteran has current psychiatric disabilities, namely PTSD, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and panic disorder as the result of the in-service sexual assault stressors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nA current psychiatric disability was incurred in active service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131, 5107(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304(f) (2011). \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nDuty to Notify and Assist\r\n\t\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 as amended (VCAA) and implementing regulations impose obligations on VA to provide claimants with notice and assistance.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2011); 38 C.F.R �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2011).\r\n\r\nAs the Board is granting the claim for service connection, the claim is substantiated, and there are no further VCAA duties.  Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet App 362, 367-68 (2001); see also 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(a)(2) (Secretary not required to provide assistance \"if no reasonable possibility exists that such assistance would aid in substantiating the claim\"); VAOPGCPREC 5-2004; 69 Fed. Reg. 59989 (2004) (the notice and duty to assist provisions of the VCAA do not apply to claims that could not be substantiated through such notice and assistance).\r\n\r\nLaws and regulations\r\n\r\nService connection will be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.\r\n\r\nEstablishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table); see also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.\r\n\r\nUnder 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b), an alternative method of establishing the second and third Shedden/Caluza element is through a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); see Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 495-97 (1997); see also Clyburn v. West, 12 Vet. App. 296, 302 (1999). \r\n\r\nContinuity of symptomatology may be established if a claimant can demonstrate (1) that a condition was \"noted\" during service; (2) evidence of post- service continuity of the same symptomatology; and (3) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptomatology.  Savage, 10 Vet. App. at 495-96; see Hickson, 12 Vet. App. at 253 (lay evidence of in-service incurrence sufficient in some circumstances for purposes of establishing service connection); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b).\r\n\r\nIn relevant part, 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(a) (West 2002) requires that VA give \"due consideration\" to \"all pertinent medical and lay evidence\" in evaluating a claim for disability or death benefits.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).\r\n\r\nThe Federal Circuit has held that \"[l]ay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.\"  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (\"[T]he Board cannot determine that lay evidence lacks credibility merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence\").\r\n\r\n\"Symptoms, not treatment, are the essence of any evidence of continuity of symptomatology.\"  Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. at 496 (citing Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 16, 19 (1991)).  Once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible.  See Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 469 (distinguishing between competency (\"a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered\") and credibility (\"a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted\")).\r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted for a disease first diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nIf a PTSD claim is based on in-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than the veteran's service records may corroborate her account of the stressor incident.  Examples of such evidence include, but are not limited to: records from law enforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(5) (2011).\r\n\r\nEvidence of behavior changes following the claimed assault is one type of relevant evidence that may be found in these sources.  Examples of behavior changes that may constitute credible evidence of the stressor include, but are not limited to: a request for a transfer to another military duty assignment; deterioration in work performance, substance abuse, episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable cause; or unexplained economic or social behavior changes. Id.\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nService department records do not contain any information or evidence demonstrating any in-service sexual assaults.  However, Fort Hood Army Hospital records, dated in May 1979, show that the Veteran sought emergency room (ER) treatment for complaints of synoscope, shortness of breath, and numbness in her right hand.  She reported having several similar episodes over the past few weeks.  The examiner assessed anxiety attack with hyperventilation.  She was prescribed valium for treatment and discharged home.  She had ER treatment the very next day when she arrived unconscious.  Unfortunately, these ER medical records are hand-written, and the Board is unable to decipher many of the words.  However, it is clear the second ER visit was again related to the syncopal episodes.  Such records also indicate an abrupt change in the Veteran's diet- as she had begun eating only candy and other sweet foods, raising some questions relating to hypoglycemia.  \r\n\r\nPost-service, VA primary care records from January 2005 show that the Veteran presented crying and reported significant emotional distress relating to recent occupational and health problems.  The primary care physician referred her to the VA mental health clinic (MHC).  On that same day, she met with a Social Worker for individual psychotherapy.  She was highly emotional and discussed a history of unreported sexual assault in the military.  She also expressed anger over her divorce five years earlier.  She was working 70 hours per week in a job that involved physical activity and she experienced neck pain.    \r\n\r\nIn February 2005, the Veteran quit her job.  She cited stressors of the in-service sexual assault and an abusive relationship with her ex-husband.  \r\n\r\nBeginning in February 2005, the Veteran began regular participation in individual and group therapy for sexual assault victims.  In March 2005, she detailed the circumstances of her in-service assault.  She reported that she was raped twice in service by the same man.  He had become a casual acquaintance after she met him at the base cafeteria.  One of the rapes took place when he offered her a ride home in his car, and the other occurred when he attacked her upon entering her residence.  Both episodes involved physical violence and death threats if she informed anyone about the assaults.  She did not report the assaults at the time.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran filed her current claim in May 2005.  In support of her claim, she provided a detailed statement about the two in-service assaults.  She reported that she was stationed at Fort Hood in 1979 when they occurred within a short period of time.  She recalled the assailant was also in the military and that she met him at the base cafeteria.  While walking home at night, he saw her and offered her a ride.  Since he was a casual acquaintance, she accepted.  He took her to another location and sexually assaulted her and threatened her life if she informed anyone.  After the first incident, she was in a state of shock and did not socialize with anyone.  A few days later, she was again attacked by the assailant upon entering her residence.  He sexually assaulted her in her residence and threatened her.  Two weeks after the last incident, she was with socializing with friends.  A male companion put his arm around her and she had a panic attack and sought ER treatment as shown in the May 1979 Fort Hood ER records.  She had a psychiatric consultation, but did not feel safe enough to report the sexual assaults.  Currently, the flashbacks and feelings of helplessness impaired her ability to socialize.  She also had insomnia, depression, and mood disturbances.       \r\n\r\nAlso of note, in her May 2005 statement, the Veteran indicated that after the in-service assaults occurred, she was surviving mainly on sugar, as she was avoiding going to the cafeteria for fear of seeing her assailant.  As noted previously, the in-service records confirm a sudden change of diet and that the Veteran was primarily subsisting on candy.\r\n\r\nIn her November 2005 stressor statement, she reported the same narrative of two sexual assaults in service.  The details were overall consistent with the narrative given in her May 2005 claim.  \r\n\r\nVA treatment records from 2006 and 2007 reflect continued psychological treatment under diagnosis of PTSD and major depressive disorder.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA psychiatric examination in June 2006.  She reported a generally good childhood, with the exception of an isolated episode of molestation and attempted rape.  She detailed two episodes of in-service sexual assault in 1979.  The details were generally consistent with her prior narratives.  She stated that she never told anyone about the two assaults until last year.  She reported recent stressors of her difficult divorce and leaving her prior job.  She currently had regular individual psychotherapy and attended a support group.  She was on medication.  She believed the treatment had helped her overall, but she remained very emotionally labile.  The examiner reviewed her reports of two in-service sexual assaults and her current symptoms of nightmares, flashbacks, memory impairment, ruminative thoughts, avoidant behaviors, irritability, and hyperarousal.  She had a significant history of motor vehicle accidents, which she attributed to her symptoms.  \r\n\r\nUpon mental status examination, the Veteran presented as appropriately groomed and exhibited a cooperative attitude.  She had mild psychomotor retardation and an anxious, tearful, and dysphoric affect.  She described a fair mood.  She denied suicidal ideation, but affirmed passive homicidal ideation.  She did not exhibit any overt psychosis, or other significant memory and concentration problems.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner diagnosed PTSD secondary to the reported in-service sexual assaults.  She concluded that the PTSD symptoms were severely affecting the Veteran's current life.  She noted that the Veteran was actively seeking treatment, but the severity of her current symptoms would preclude her from gainful employment.     \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's treating psychiatrist submitted a May 2007 letter.  He reported treating the Veteran for the past two years.  He detailed many of her current psychological symptoms.  He indicated that she had PTSD due military sexual trauma.  \r\n\r\nAt the July 2012 hearing, the Veteran reported that she believes her current psychological problems were related to distress over the in-service sexual assaults.  She again presented a narrative of two in-service sexual assaults that were largely consistent with her prior reports.  She recalled being treated for hyperventilation in May 1979 and declining to report the assaults during a psychiatric evaluation.  She did not seek psychiatric treatment until February 2005.  At that time, she had left her stressful job and had a flare up of PTSD symptoms such as flashbacks and nightmares, among others.  She disclosed the two sexual assaults to her treating clinician.  She stated that prior to February 2005 she self coped.  She cited behavior as often carrying a firearm.  She attributed her involvement in an abusive relationship to her psychological problems.  Currently, she exhibited severely socially isolated behavior.  Her husband provided testimony corroborating her reports of current symptoms.  \r\n\r\nTurning to review of the record, the Board considers the Veteran to be credible in her reports of two episodes of sexual assault taking place in April 1979.  The record includes several narratives given by her detailing the assaults.  They are generally consistent, and the events recounted by her are not inherently implausible.  See Caluza, 7 Vet. App. at 506 (Board may weigh evidence based upon plausibility and consistency with the record).  Hence, they carry probative weight.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's reports of in-service sexual assault are also corroborated by the May 1979 Fort Hood ER records.  The Board considers the reports given to Fort Hood ER records to be an alternative evidentiary source within the meaning of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (5).  These records document an anxiety attack and suggest a significant behavior change in light of the now reported assaults.  Overall, the Board finds the evidence probative to show that two in-service sexual assaults occurred.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the Veteran is competent to report the assaults and her symptoms, she has not been shown to have formal psychiatric training and is not competent to provide a self-diagnosis.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 438 (2011); Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 470 (1994).  However, the June 2006 VA psychiatric examination and May 2007 treating psychiatrist's letter are competent medical evidence that the Veteran currently has PTSD due to the in-service sexual assaults.  They are uncontroverted by the additional medical evidence of record.   \r\n\r\nIn summary, the record contains credible evidence of in-service sexual assaults and competent medical evidence showing that the Veteran's current symptoms meet the PTSD diagnostic criteria and are related to the reported in-service sexual assault stressors.  Service connection for PTSD based upon in-service sexual assault is granted.  38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304(f)(5).  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that additional psychiatric diagnoses of anxiety disorder, major depression, and panic disorder are raised by the record.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1; see VA treatment records from February 2005 to June 2007.  The treating clinicians have not delineating a separate etiology for these symptoms.  Where an examiner is unable to distinguish the symptoms of a service-connected disability from non-service connected manifestations, all the manifestations will be considered part of the service-connected disability.  Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181, 182 (1998) (citing Mitchem v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 136, 140 (1996)).  Accordingly, the Board must consider additional psychiatric disorder of anxiety disorder, major depression, and panic disorder as service related.  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for an acquired psychological disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and panic disorder is granted. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nERIC S.

Lawson, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty from May 1954 to April 1956.  This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2008 rating decision of the Phoenix, Arizona Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In March 2009, a hearing was held before a Decision Review Officer (DRO) at the RO.  A transcript of the hearing is associated with the Veteran's claims file.  The case was remanded to the RO in August 2012.  \r\n\r\nThe issue on appeal was characterized as service connection for PTSD.  Since the records shows another psychiatric diagnosis, and in light of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veteran's Claims (Court) decision in Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009), it has been recharacterized as stated on the preceding page.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran initiated appeals of denials of service connection for asbestosis, sleep apnea, and residuals of frostbite of the bilateral lower extremities.  He withdrew his appeals pertaining to asbestosis and sleep apnea in March 2009.  An August 2009 DRO decision granted him service connection for residuals of frostbite of both lower extremities; consequently, these matters are not before the Board.  \r\n\r\nPlease note this appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c) (2012).  38 U.S.C.A. � 7107(a)(2) (West 2002).\r\n\r\nThe appeal is being REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action on his part is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nA review of the record found that this matter is not ripe for appellate review.  \r\n\r\nThere is conflicting medical evidence regarding whether or not the Veteran has a psychiatric disorder that is related to his service.  In support of his claim he has submitted statements from E. Alcantar, M.D., who in March 2007 stated that the Veteran has PTSD, and in October 2009 stated that the Veteran has depression and probable PTSD, and that it was his opinion that such disorders are related to the Veteran's service in Korea, including the harsh weather he endured these and his observations of the aftermaths of war, such as starvation of the civilian population.  Dr. Alcantar indicated that he has treated the Veteran since 2001.  He did not fully explain the rationale for his opinions.  The probative value of medical evidence is determined in part by the rationale provided and also in part by factual data that were considered.  Therefore, the records of the treatment he provided to the Veteran are pertinent evidence that must be secured.  \r\n\r\nThe records of the Veteran's treatment by Dr. Alcantar are not associated with the record.  In August 2012, pursuant to the Board's remand the Veteran was asked to submit Dr. Alcantar's records or to submit an authorization for VA to obtain them on his behalf.; he was advised he had a year to respond.   He has not yet responded; the year he was afforded to do so has not lapsed.  Nonetheless, the case was returned to the Board (with development pending).   \r\n\r\nAs the case was prematurely returned to the Board, with action sought by a prior remand not completed, it must be returned to the RO for corrective action.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).  The Board is aware that this case has been advanced on its docket.  However, expedited handling of this case is entirely within the Veteran's control.  He can expedite the process by a prompt response (or if such is his intent, indicating that he will not provide the authorizations sought, and waiving the remainder of the year period provided for such purpose).  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n(Please note, this appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c) (2012).  Expedited handling is requested.)\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should again seek from the Veteran authorization for VA to secure for the record from Dr. Alcantar the complete clinical records of all evaluations and treatment he has provided the Veteran since 2001.  The RO should obtain such records, and then arrange for any further development suggested by the information therein.   If the Veteran does not provide the release requested (or submit the records himself), the claim must be processed further under 38 C.F.R. � 3.158(a) (2012).  If Dr. E.A. does not respond to the RO's request for records sought with the Veteran's authorization, the Veteran should be so advised, and advised further that ultimately it is his responsibility to ensure that private medical records are received.  \r\n\r\n2.  The RO should then review the record and readjudicate the claim (to encompass all psychiatric diagnoses shown by the record), under  38 C.F.R. � 3.158(a), if applicable (i.e., dismissing the claim as abandoned).  If it remains denied, the RO should issue an appropriate supplemental statement of the case and afford the Veteran the opportunity to respond.  The case should then be returned to the Board, if in order, for further review.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).  This claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2012).\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nGeorge R.

Hal Smith, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from February 1978 to July 1988\r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2006 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Jackson, Mississippi.  The Veteran's claims file has since been transferred to the RO in Montgomery, Alabama.  \r\n\r\nIn a November 2011 Board decision, it was determined that new and material evidence has been received that was sufficient to reopen the previously denied claim of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.  The claim was reopened and remanded for additional evidentiary development, to include the procurement of pertinent treatment records and a contemporaneous VA psychiatric examination to assess the severity and etiology of any currently diagnosed psychiatric disorder.  The claim has now been returned for additional appellate consideration.  \r\n\r\nThe following determinations are based on review of the Veteran's claims file in addition to his Virtual VA \"eFolder.\"  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  There is clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran had depression and PTSD prior to her service entrance.  There is clear and unmistakable evidence that these conditions were not aggravated during service.  \r\n\r\n2.  The Veteran has been diagnosed as having a personality disorder; there is no superimposed disease or injury during service that created additional disability.  \r\n\r\n3.  Trichotillomania has not been shown by competent evidence to be related to service.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, major depression, a personality disorder, and trichotillomania, are not met.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2012); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303 (2012).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nDuty to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application, VA must notify the claimant of the information and evidence not of record that is necessary to substantiate a claim, which information and evidence VA will obtain, and which information and evidence the claimant is expected to provide.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) (West 2002 & Supp. 2012).  The notice requirements apply to all five elements of a service connection claim: veteran status; existence of a disability; a connection between the veteran's service and the disability; degree of disability; and effective date of the disability.  Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).  The notice must be provided to a claimant before the initial unfavorable adjudication by the RO.  Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App.112 (2004).  The notice requirements may be satisfied if any errors in the timing or content of such notice are not prejudicial to the claimant.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 103 (2005), rev'd on other grounds, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  \r\n\r\nThis claim is a reopened claim that was previously denied.  After the Veteran's December 2005 claim to reopen the previously denied claim was received at the RO, the RO issued a notice letter to the Veteran in January 2006.  That notification letter identified the elements of a service connection claim; identified the evidence necessary to substantiate a claim; and identified the relative duties of VA and the claimant to obtain evidence.  The letter also notified the Veteran of the reasons for the previous denial of service connection and what evidence qualified as new and material evidence.  Additionally, a March 2006 notice letter explained how a disability rating is determined an effective date upon the grant of any benefit sought, in compliance with Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 112 (2004); see also Mayfield vs. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 103 (2005) rev'd on other grounds, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  \r\n\r\nVA has a heightened burden of VCAA notification for claims of service connection for PTSD based on in-service personal assault.  See Gallegos v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 329 (2008).  VA will not deny a PTSD claim that is based on in-service personal assault without first advising the claimant that evidence from sources other than the Veteran's service records or evidence of behavior changes may constitute credible supporting evidence of the stressor.  The Veteran should also be allowed the opportunity to furnish this type of evidence or advise VA of potential sources of such evidence.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2012).  In Bradford v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 200 (2006), the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) \"unequivocally\" provides that VA cannot deny a PTSD claim without first providing the requisite notice discussed above.  See also Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272, 281-82 (1999) (noting that the RO must send the claimant a \"special PTSD personal-assault letter\" and questionnaire to assist VA in identifying alternative sources of evidence to establish an in-service stressor).  \r\n\r\nIn this case, correspondence sent to the Veteran when she first filed a claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder included request for specific details of the Veteran's claimed personal trauma incident(s) which she asserted result in her current acquired psychiatric disorders.  (See the 2002 PTSD Secondary to Personal Assault Questionnaire.)  During the course of this appeal, the claim was subsequently reopened by the Board in its November 2011 decision, and the matter was remanded for additional development of the record.  She received an additional letter in November 2011 which again identified the evidence necessary to substantiate a claim based on inservice personal assault and the relative duties of VA and the claimant to obtain evidence.  \r\n\r\nThroughout the appeal, the Veteran has submitted statements to support her claim.  VA has obtained service treatment records (STRs) to the extent available, assisted the Veteran in obtaining evidence, afforded the Veteran physical examinations, obtained medical opinions as to the etiology of her psychiatric disorders, and afforded the Veteran the opportunity to give testimony before the Board.  All known and available records relevant to the issues on appeal have been obtained and associated with the claims file, and the Veteran has not contended otherwise.  \r\n\r\nThe Board remanded the matter in November 2011, part, for additional development of the record.  The remand explained that an examination was necessary to obtain an opinion as to the etiology of currently acquired psychiatric disorders.  A VA examination was conducted in January 2012.  In addition, private and VA records were obtained, and the Veteran was provided with additional notice as to the type of information she might submit in order to substantiate her claim for psychiatric disorders based on personal assault.  \r\n\r\nThe January 2012 VA examination is adequate as it is based on a review of the history and a physician examination.  Additionally, the examiner's opinion addresses the Veteran's contentions and is based on sound medical principles and accompanied by complete rationale.  Based on the foregoing, the RO has substantially complied with the November 2011 remand instructions and no further action is necessary in this regard.  \r\n\r\nVA has complied with the notice and assistance requirements and the Veteran is not prejudiced by a decision on the claim at this time.\r\n\r\nMerits of the Claim\r\n\r\nIn various statements of record, the Veteran contends that she was harassed by superior officers during service on account of her weight, for which she was eventually discharged, resulting in ongoing depression since her period of active service.  She also contends that she suffered domestic abuse, to include rape, during active duty, which ultimately led to her diagnosis of PTSD.  In one statement (August 2012), she pointed out that she had an anxiety attack during service when exposed to gas.  She argues that her psychiatric disorders are related to that incident.  In the alternative, her representative argues in a March 2013 brief that she had a preexisting psychiatric disorder that was aggravated by her military service.  He argues that the presumption of soundness applies as no preexisting psychiatric disorder was noted at time of service entrance.  \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131 (2012).  With chronic disease shown as such in service so as to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.  When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after discharge is required to support a claim of service connection.  When the disease identity is established (leprosy, tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis, etc.), there is no requirement of evidentiary showing of continuity.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b) (2012).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d) (2012).  \r\n\r\nGenerally, in order to prevail on the merits on the issue of service connection, there must be medical evidence of current disability; medical or, in certain circumstances lay, evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1131 (West 2002 & Supp. 2012); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (2012).  See also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).  \r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that claims for service connection for PTSD includes claims for service connection for any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  \r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition; a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2012).  \r\n\r\nGenerally, the occurrence of an event alleged as the \"stressor\" upon which a PTSD diagnosis is based (as opposed to the sufficiency of the alleged event to cause PTSD) is an adjudicative determination, not a medical determination.  See Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 97-98 (1993).  The evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a recognizable stressor during service to support a diagnosis of PTSD will vary depending upon whether the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, as established by recognized military combat citations or other official records.  If VA determines either that the Veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy or that the Veteran did engage in combat, but that the alleged stressor is not combat related, the Veteran's lay testimony, by itself, is not sufficient to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor and his testimony must be corroborated by credible supporting evidence.  See Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997); Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389 (1996).  \r\n\r\nIf a PTSD claim is based on an in-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than the Veteran's service records may corroborate the Veteran's account of the stressor incident.  Examples of such evidence include, but are not limited to: records from law enforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy.  Evidence of behavior changes following the claimed assault is one type of relevant evidence that may be found in these sources.  Examples of behavior changes that may constitute credible evidence of the stressor include, but are not limited to: a request for a transfer to another military duty assignment; deterioration in work performance; substance abuse; episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable cause; or unexplained economic or social behavior changes.  VA will not deny a PTSD claim that is based on in-service personal assault without first advising the claimant that evidence from sources other than the Veteran's service records or evidence of behavior changes may constitute credible supporting evidence of the stressor and allowing him or her the opportunity to furnish this type of evidence or advise VA of potential sources of such evidence.  \r\n\r\nRegardless of the factual adjudication of the occurrence of an assault, VA may submit any evidence that it receives to an appropriate medical or mental health professional for an opinion as to whether it indicates that a personal assault occurred.  See Gallegos and Patton, supra.  \r\n\r\nThe Court has held that credible supporting evidence of the actual occurrence of an in-service stressor cannot consist solely of after-the-fact medical nexus evidence.  See Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 396 (1996).  However, the Court subsequently held that its prior categorical statements that after-the-fact medical nexus evidence may not be the basis for corroborating a non-combat stressor are \"not operative\" in cases for service connection for PTSD based on personal assault, in light of the special evidentiary procedures implemented by VA for adjudication of claims for PTSD based on in-service personal assault, as described above.  See Patton, 12 Vet. App. at 280.  \r\n\r\nPrior to the receipt of the Veteran's claim to reopen in December 2005, 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) was amended with specific regard to PTSD claims based upon personal assault, and is now consistent with the holdings of the Court and VA evidentiary procedures, as described above.  See 67 Fed. Reg. 10,330 (March 7, 2002), codified at 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2012).  The effective date of the amendment was March 7, 2002, the date of its first issuance as a final rule.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that she has an acquired psychiatric disorder as a result of non-combat stressors, including in-service assaults.  See, e.g., her statement added to the record in March 2002 in which she claimed harassment during service from her superiors, as well as abusive behavior from her husband.  She further noted a history of rape and abusive relationships that she had been in.  \r\n\r\nWhile the evidence of record suggests that the Veteran may have a preexisting psychiatric disorder (see the VAX of January 2012), the Board finds that when she entered active service she was in sound mental condition.  For purposes of establishing service connection under 38 U.S.C.A. � 1131, every Veteran shall be taken to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1132 (West 2002 & Supp. 2012); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(b) (2012).  \r\n\r\nTo rebut the presumption of sound condition for disorders not noted on the entrance or enlistment examination, VA's General Counsel has clarified that VA must show by clear and unmistakable evidence both that the disease or injury existed prior to service and that the disease or injury was not aggravated by service.  The claimant is not required to show that the disease or injury increased in severity during service before VA's duty under the second prong of this rebuttal standard attaches.  VAOPGCPREC 3-2003.  The Court and Federal Circuit Court have adopted the General Counsel's position.  Quirin v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 390, 396 (2009); Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  \r\n\r\nThe government may show a lack of aggravation by establishing that there was no increase in disability during service or that any increase in disability was due to the natural progress of the preexisting condition.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1153 (West 2002 & Supp. 2012); 38 C.F.R. � 3.306 (2012).  See also Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096.  If this burden is met, then the Veteran is not entitled to service-connected benefits.  However, if the government fails to rebut the presumption of soundness under Section 1111 or 1132 by clear and unmistakable evidence both that the disease or injury existed prior to service and that the disease or injury was not aggravated by service, the Veteran's claim is one of service connection on a direct incurrence basis.  Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096.  \r\n\r\nThe law provides that an increase in disability must consist of worsening of the enduring disability.  Davis v. Principi, 276 F.3d 1341, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2002).  Aggravation may not be conceded where the disability underwent no increase in severity during service on the basis of all the evidence of record pertaining to the manifestations of the disability prior to, during, and subsequent to service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1153 (West 2002 & Supp. 2012); 38 C.F.R. � 3.306 (2012); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 402 (1995).  See also Davis v. Principi, 276 F.3d 1341, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (which holds that evidence of a temporary flare-up, without more, does not satisfy the level of proof required of a non-combat Veteran to establish an increase in disability).  \r\n\r\nA \"lasting worsening of the condition\"-that is, a worsening that existed not only at the time of separation but one that still exists currently is required.  See Routen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 183, 189 (1997); see also Verdon v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 529, 538 (1996).  Evidence of a prolonged period without medical complaint can be considered, along with other factors concerning the Veteran's health and medical treatment during and after military service, as evidence of whether a preexisting condition was aggravated by military service.  Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  \r\n\r\n\"Clear and unmistakable evidence\" is a more formidable evidentiary burden than the preponderance of the evidence standard.  See Vanerson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 254, 258 (1999) (noting that the \"clear and convincing\" burden of proof, while a higher standard than a preponderance of the evidence, is a lower burden to satisfy than that of \"clear and unmistakable evidence\".)  That is, the standard of proof for rebutting the presumption of soundness is not merely evidence that is \"cogent and compelling, i.e., a sufficient showing, but evidence that is clear and unmistakable, i.e., undebatable....\"  Vanerson, 12 Vet. App. at 261.  It is an \"onerous\" evidentiary standard, requiring that the preexistence of a condition and the no-aggravation result be \"undebatable.\"  Cotant v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 116, 131 (2003) citing Laposky v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 331, 334 (1993).  \r\n\r\nIn rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence that it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.  See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).  Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  The former is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while the latter is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted.  See Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Cartwright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) (\"Although interest may affect the credibility of testimony, it does not affect competency to testify.\").  \r\n\r\nThere is no mention of any mental disorder in the Veteran's service entrance examination, and there are no clinical records indicating that the Veteran was treated for or noted to have had a psychiatric disorder prior to her being accepted for active military service in 1978.  \r\n\r\nAs noted in the Board's 2011 decision, during the Veteran's period of service, there were no complaints, treatment, or diagnoses of any acquired psychiatric disorders within the period.  She was seen in 1984 for a \"one time anxiety reaction to CS gas vs. true CS gas hypersensitivity.\"  Her personnel records contain numerous accounts of her participation in an inservice weight loss program, as well as documentation of her ultimate discharge due to her failure to meet the height and weight standards of the U.S. Army.  \r\n\r\nAdditional evidence of record at the time of the Board's decision in 2011 to reopen and remand the claim includes the 2002 PTSD questionnaire regarding personal assaults, a postservice VA exam in January 2003 which failed to address whether an inservice stressor ultimately led to her psychiatric disorder, a VA outpatient report from November 2005 which diagnosed PTSD linked to inservice sexual trauma, but without actual corroboration of the stressor.  A VA memorandum from February 2008 reflects that there was insufficient evidence available to support a stressor for PTSD in that the STRs were negative for diagnosis of a chronic acquired psychiatric disorder and because the Veteran had failed to provide specifics that might corroborate her claim that she was raped during service.  Upon November 2011 remand, additional examination was requested.  \r\n\r\nThe requested examination report is dated in January 2012.  At that time, the VA examiner noted that the claims file was reviewed.  The Veteran had symptoms of low self esteem, anger and irritability, depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, disturbance of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstance s including work or a worklike setting, persistent delusions or hallucinations, neglect of personal appearance and hygiene, and impaired impulse control.  The examiner diagnosed depressive disorder not otherwise specified with psychotic symptoms, PTSD, personality disorder not otherwise specified, and trichotillomania (hair pulling).  The examiner noted that the Veteran's stressor was not related to her fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.  \r\n\r\nThe January 2012 report reflects that the Veteran gave a history of having been raped at age 16 and by her husband numerous times during service.  Post service, she reported being raped again in 1997 and in 2001.  She also said that her husband had beaten her in 1991.  During childhood, there were arguments in the home, and her father was physically and verbally abusive to the Veteran's mother prior to their divorce.  She was verbally abused by her mother and picked on by other kids.  She did not stand up for herself because she hated confrontation.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner noted that review of the Veteran's record of promotion during service showed good conduct medals in 1981 and 1984.  These records suggested adequate to good performance until at least 1986.  However, in an August 1987 performance review, she received a below average rating, and it was noted that she constantly complained to lower enlisted soldiers and avoided the chain of command.  \r\n\r\nDuring service, the Veteran was mandated to work on losing weight.  The examiner related the Veteran's complaints that her weight issues may have been secondary to issues with her husband and began in approximately 1987.  She was medically discharged for failure to meet the weight standards in 1988.  \r\n\r\nAs to the Veteran's depressive disorder, the examiner opined that this condition preexisted service and was not aggravated therein.  For rationale, it was noted that the depression had its roots in learning and early childhood experiences.  Also, there was evidence that the Veteran did well for most of her military career and was less depressed for much of her career.  At present, the examiner opined that the Veteran's depression centered around her numerous situational stressors and not military factors.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner also opined that the Veteran's PTSD preexisted service and was not aggravated therein.  For rationale, it was noted that the Veteran clearly had PTSD symptoms from being raped at the age of 16.  The Veteran's report of details of the event and its aftermath, her emotional reaction when discussing it, and her symptoms related to it, were all consistent with such an event.  The examiner further noted that the Veteran's preexisting PTSD was aggravated by her 1991 post service beating by her husband.  The examiner added that there was no evidence in the record that marked changes in performance around, shortly after, or even for several years after her marriage in 1982.  In fact, the Veteran had promotions over time along with a good conduct medal in 1984, which suggested that her performance was adequate or better.  \r\n\r\nAs to the Veteran's personality disorder, it was opined that this condition was not caused by or related to active duty service; or otherwise aggravated beyond the usual course of the disorder by military service.  For rationale, it was noted that the definition of personality disorders included that they were long standing and colored most aspects of how a person typically responds to the world and others.  Generally, it has its roots in childhood, and there was ample evidence of circumstances in the Veteran's early life that led to development of personality disorder not otherwise specified before military service.  \r\n\r\nThe final psychiatric condition addressed by the examiner was the Veteran's hair pulling (trichotillomania).  She opined that this condition was also not related to or caused by military service.  For rationale, she noted that the Veteran's hair pulling \"under anxiety behavior and symptoms appeared well after she left military service.\"  The condition was a general response and attempt to cope with current life anxiety and stress and generally not a response to any past events.  \r\n\r\nInitially, as noted earlier, there is no mention of any mental disorder in the Veteran's service entrance exam.  Thus, as an acquired psychiatric disorder was not mentioned when the Veteran entered active duty, the presumption of soundness applies.  \r\n\r\nNext, the Board must determine whether, under 38 U.S.C.A. � 1132 and 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(b), the presumption of soundness is rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence that the claimed acquired psychiatric disability existed prior to service and was not aggravated therein.  Other than a one time report of anxiety due to exposure to gas, there was no mention during service of psychiatric problems.  And post service records show treatment from 2001 forward for psychiatric disorders, to include PTSD and depression.  Recently diagnosed were the conditions of a personality disorder and trichotillomania.  As noted in the record, although the Veteran reported inservice stressors regarding harassment by superior officers and abuse by her husband, there is no actual documentation that such occurred.  Moreover, there is evidence that she had a difficult childhood and that she was raped prior to service when she was 16.  These facts were related by the Veteran herself at the time of VA exam in 2012.  In the examiner's opinion, the Veteran's depression and PTSD preexisted service and were not aggravated therein.  Her rationale included that depression had its roots in childhood experiences and learning.  The details given by the Veteran pertaining to her rape at 16 and its aftermath, to include her emotional reaction, showed that her symptoms were consistent with such an event.  As her performance marks during service showed that she was performing adequately during the time that she says that she was harassed by her superiors and abused by her husband, aggravation during service is not indicated.  \r\n\r\nThe Board does not find the November 2005 opinion that supports the Veteran's claim persuasive.  The Board is not bound to accept medical opinions that are based on history supplied by the veteran, where that history is unsupported by the medical evidence or based upon an inaccurate factual background.  Black v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 177 (1993); Swann v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 229 (1993); Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 460- 61 (1993).  In this regard, the November 2005 report that the Veteran had PTSD related to military and other sexual assaults and abusive relationships is clearly based on the Veteran's reported history, which the Board does not find credible.  Specifically, the related history at the time of the evaluation did not include knowledge of the preservice rape, and as indicated above, there is no inservice evidence of harassment by her superior officers or that her husband abused her.  As reflected above, she was separated from service due to inability to meet weight standards.  There simply is no evidence that alleged inservice incidents regarding harassment, abuse, or rape had anything to do with her exit.  Thus, because the Board finds that the reasoning that the examiner used in November 2005 in supporting her opinion is directly contradicted by the objective evidence of record, the Board affords her opinion to be of little probative value.  Bloom v. West, 12 Vet. App. 185, 187 (1999) (The value of a physician's statement is dependent, in part, upon the extent to which it reflects \"clinical data or other rationale to support his opinion.\") Black v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 177, 180 (1995) (Thus, a medical opinion is inadequate when it is unsupported by clinical evidence.)  \r\n\r\nThe Board affords greater probative value to the January 2012 examiner's opinion.  Her opinions were based on review of the claims file and interview of the Veteran.  The exam was conducted by a licensed clinical psychologist with clinical expertise with psychiatric disabilities.  Importantly, the examiner provided reasoning and cited to objective evidence of record when rendering her opinions.  Thus, the Board finds them to be persuasive.  \r\n\r\nAfter considering the foregoing, the Board concludes that there is clear and unmistakable evidence to rebut the presumption of soundness to show that the Veteran did have depression and PTSD prior her service entrance.  Specifically, the Board agrees with the January 2012 VA examiner's reasoning that her preservice history (as related by the Veteran) shows that she entered service with a psychiatric condition based on her childhood history that included being raped at age 16.  The Board finds the examiner's conclusion that there is clear evidence that the Veteran had preexisting depression and PTSD disorders to be highly probative because her conclusions are based on her clinical expertise as a psychologist, review of the evidence of record, and assessment of the Veteran's credibility, with which the Board agrees.  \r\n\r\nHaving found clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran had preexisting depression and PTSD disorders, the Board must show by clear and unmistakable evidence that these conditions were not aggravated by service.  The Board is persuaded by the January 2012 VA examiner's conclusion that there is no supporting evidence that the Veteran's experiences in the military had an effect on the course of her psychiatric conditions.  The Board finds it significant that additional treatment for psychiatric complaints during service is indicated on only one occasion when she experienced anxiety after being exposed to gas.  Thus, even if the Veteran did experience one stressful event during service, the examiner nevertheless concluded that they had no lasting effect on the progression of her depression or PTSD.  Therefore, the Board concludes that there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran had preexisting depression and PTSD disorders that were not aggravated during her military service.  As such, the presumption of soundness has been rebutted and service connection must be denied.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (2012).  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's STRs are negative for any complaints, treatment, or findings that suggest an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include the trichotillomania which was first noted many years after service.  This also includes consideration of the one time in-service report of anxiety due to gas exposure.  It would be pure speculation to find that such, without more, indicated the presence of a psychiatric disorder.  Moreover, no physician has found that such an acquired psychiatric disorder was originated during her service.  The VA examiner in 2012 specifically opined after review of the record and interview of the Veteran, that this hair pulling disorder was an anxiety disorder which appeared well after she left military service.  It was noted that it was a general response and attempt to cope with current life anxiety and stress, and generally not a response to any past events.  Therefore, the Board finds that this acquired psychiatric disorder was not affirmatively shown to be present during service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1131 (West 2002 & Supp. 2012); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a) (2012).  \r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of trichotillomania was not until many years after service, and an examiner has specifically found that it is unrelated to service.  The length of time between the Veteran's separation from service, and the initial confirmed clinical diagnosis weighs against continuity of symptomatology.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b) (2012); Maxson v. Gober, 230 F3d. 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  The absence of symptoms constitutes negative evidence and opposes the claim for this psychiatric condition.  Forshey v. Principi, 284 F.3d 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2002).  The Board finds that the psychiatric disorder of trichotillomania was not shown during service or until many years thereafter.  \r\n\r\nAs to the personality disorder diagnosed, it is pointed out that defects of congenital or development origin preexist service by their very nature.  Moreover, with respect to personality disorders, congenital or developmental abnormalities are not \"diseases or injuries within the meaning of applicable legislation\" and, hence, do not constitute disability for VA compensation purposes.  38 C.F.R. �� 3.303(c), 4.9 (2012).  However, service connection may be granted, in limited circumstances, for disability due to aggravation of a constitutional or developmental abnormality by superimposed disease or injury.  See VAOPGCPREC 82-90, 55 Fed. Reg. 45,711 (1990); Carpenter v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 240, 245 (1995); Monroe v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 513, 514-15 (1993).  Therefore, the next step of the inquiry is to determine whether the Veteran developed a chronic psychiatric disability during active service.  \r\n\r\nIn this regard, and for all the reasons set forth above concerning whether the Veteran's current psychiatric disorder is related to service, it is clear that the Veteran's personality disorder was clearly and unmistakably not aggravated during service and service connection for a personality disorder cannot be granted.  This is true because there is no competent evidence of record which shows the Veteran suffered a disability which was superimposed upon her personality disorder during service.  This aspect of the appeal was specifically addressed by the medical evidence in the January 2012 VA examination report, as described above.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the Veteran claims that she has a psychiatric disability related to service, the Board finds that such claims are outweighed by the competent medical evidence pointing to the contrary.  Although the Veteran is competent to describe symptoms of anxiety and sadness, the issue of medical causation of psychiatric condition are not subject to lay observation under the circumstances of this case.  The determination as to the presence, type, and cause of a psychiatric condition is medical in nature and not capable of lay observation.  Indeed, by regulation, the diagnosis of PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance 38 C.F.R. � 4.125, that is, a diagnosis that conforms to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM- IV).  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2012).  For that reason, a psychiatric disorder is not a simple medical condition that a lay person is competent to identify or link to service.  Jandreau v. Nicholson,492 F.3d. 1372 Fed. Cir. 2007).  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is denied.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nJONATHAN B.

Barone, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty from February 1981 to March 1983.  This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on remand from the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  The case was originally before the Board on appeal from an April 2003 rating decision of the Los Angeles, California Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The Veteran requested a Travel Board hearing in her June 2005 VA Form 9, substantive appeal, but withdrew this request in a statement received in July 2005.  In April 2008, the case was remanded for additional development and to satisfy notice requirements.  In October 2010, the Board issued a decision denying service connection for PTSD and MDD.  The appellant appealed that decision to the Court.  In July 2012, the Court issued a memorandum decision vacating the October 2010 Board decision and remanding the matters on appeal for readjudication consistent with the instructions outlined in memorandum decision.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that it has reviewed both the Veteran's physical claims file and \"Virtual VA\" (VA's electronic data storage system) to ensure that the complete record is considered.  At present there are no additional documents pertinent to this appeal in Virtual VA.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action on her part is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Court's July 2012 memorandum decision found that remand was necessary, concluding that \"the Board clearly erred in finding that the 2009 VA compensation and pension PTSD examination, including the 2010 addendum, was adequate.\"  Specifically, the Court noted: \"The examination did not address whether the appellant's MDD was incurred or aggravated by active duty military service.\"  The Court noted that such an evaluation was \"undoubtedly pertinent to the appellant's claim\" and found that the Board erred in \"relying, in large part, on the examination that failed to address the etiology and history of the appellant's MDD.\"\r\n\r\nThe Court's decision otherwise goes on to note that \"to the extent that the appellant now contends that her psychiatric problem(s) began prior to service, her PTSD diagnosis is inextricably intertwined with any such review, and will be remanded to the Board to preserve judicial economy.\"  The Court furthermore noted that the Veteran also advances a theory that her first psychiatric symptoms had onset during service after no psychiatric symptoms or defects were noted upon entry (arguing that 38 U.S.C.A. � 1111 is applicable to her claim); in this regard, the Court explains that as \"VA must still provide the appellant with an adequate medical examination, her additional arguments are best addressed after any further development by VA on remand.\" Finally, the Court rejected the Veteran's argument that the Board erred by failing to apply 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) to her allegations of in-service sexual assaults resulting in PTSD.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, the Board finds it necessary to remand this case to the RO/AMC for a new VA psychiatric examination with a more adequate examination report; this appears to be the course of action mandated by the Court's findings.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should arrange for the Veteran to be examined by a psychiatrist to determine whether she has PTSD or MDD that has been caused or permanently aggravated by her active duty military service (to include as based upon her alleged personal assaults in service).  The examiner must review the entire record (to include this remand) in conjunction with the examination, and the examination and the report thereof should be in accordance with DSM-IV.\r\n\r\nUpon review of the claims file and examination of the Veteran, the examiner should offer opinions that respond to the following:\r\n\r\n(a) Please identify (by psychiatric diagnosis) any and each chronic psychiatric disability entity currently found or diagnosed during the pendency of this claim (since the year 2002).\r\n\r\n(b) As to each psychiatric disability entity diagnosed, is it at least as likely as not (a 50% or greater probability) that any symptoms shown during active duty military service were manifestations of the chronic psychiatric disability (i.e., is any chronic psychiatric diagnosis shown to have manifested during the Veteran's active duty military service)?  The response to this question must specifically address the claimed psychiatric diagnoses of PTSD and MDD.  The response to this question should address the Veteran's lay statements concerning symptom history, as well as all other available pertinent information.\r\n\r\n(c) As to any and each psychiatric disability entity diagnosed, is it at least as likely as not (a 50% or greater probability) that such disability was caused by (or otherwise a consequence of) her military service or any event therein, to include the alleged incidents of hazing, harassment, and assault in 1981?  The response to this question must specifically address the Veteran's claimed psychiatric diagnoses of PTSD and MDD.  The response to this question should address the Veteran's lay statements concerning psychiatric stressor events and symptom history.\r\n\r\n(d) As to any and each psychiatric disability diagnosed, is it at least as likely as not (a 50% or greater probability) that such disability pre-existed service and was permanently aggravated by (increased in severity during/due to) her military service or any event therein, to include the alleged incidents of hazing, harassment, and assault in 1981?  The response to this question must specifically address both of the claimed psychiatric diagnoses ( PTSD and MDD).  The response should address the Veteran's lay statements concerning psychiatric stressor events and symptom history.  If the opinion is to the effect that military service did not cause, but aggravated, the psychiatric disability/disabilities, the examiner should also identify, so far as possible, the degree of psychiatric disability resulting from such aggravation.  The examiner must explain the rationale for all opinions, to include comment on any credibility issues raised by the record (i.e., by conflicting reports).\r\n\r\n(e) Does the record reflect that during service the Veteran exhibited behavioral changes suggesting she was a victim of personal/sexual assault?  Are her explanations why behavioral changes are not documented to a greater degree even though she was deeply affected by personal assaults consistent with what an individual might experience under these circumstances?\r\n\r\n(f) Are the Veteran's behavioral changes/disciplinary problems, noted in the latter part of her service and postservice, corroborating evidence that her alleged stressor events in service actually occurred?\r\n\r\n(g) Does the Veteran have PTSD or MDD resulting from the alleged stressor events (hazing and harassment in May 1981 and two incidents of sexual assault in July and December 1981) in service?  The examiner must explain the rationale for all opinions;  the explanation should include discussion of such factors as the Veteran's history of childhood sexual trauma, and whether there are any indications (i.e., from the nature of behavior changes or disciplinary problems) that her behavior changes or disciplinary problems in-service were in response to a stressor event (versus merely misconduct)?  The examiner should discuss any credibility issues raised by the record.\r\n\r\n2.  The RO should then review the record and readjudicate the claim.  If it remains denied, the RO should issue an appropriate SSOC and afford the Veteran and her representative the opportunity to respond.  The case should then be returned to the Board, if in order, for further review.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).  This claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2012).\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nGeorge R.

Kedem, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from 1962 to 1965.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2012 decision by which the RO denied entitlement to service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that while the Veteran claims service connection for PTSD; he has received a diagnosis of that psychiatric disorder.  A review of the claims file, however, reveals diagnoses of an anxiety disorder.  As such, the Board has recharacterized the claim as expressed above to include any acquired psychiatric disorder from which the Veteran presently suffers.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record).\r\n\r\nThe claim requires further development before being decided on appeal, so the Board is remanding the claim to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC) in Washington, DC.\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nA remand is required in this case to ensure there is a complete record upon which to decide this claim.  VA has a duty to make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate a claim for the benefit sought, unless no reasonable possibility exists that such assistance would aid in substantiating the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(a) (West 2002 & Supp. 2013); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c), (d) (2013).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran alleges that he has an acquired psychiatric disorder that is related to service.  He asserts that he suffers from PTSD, although the evidence available to the Board at this time does not reflect a diagnosis of PTSD.  Rather, the Veteran has been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.  A March 2007 written statement from the Veteran's sister submitted in connection with an unrelated claim indicates that the Veteran appeared different upon discharge.  At that time, she noticed a change in personality as well as nervousness in the Veteran.\r\n\r\nBecause there is evidence of a current psychiatric disorder and some evidence of its presence immediately following service separation, a VA mental disorders examination is necessary for a diagnosis of all extant acquired psychiatric disorders as well as an opinion regarding the likely etiology of each such disability diagnosed.  The examination instructions are contained in the second paragraph below.\r\n\r\nThe claims file contains records from the Kansas City VA Medical Center (MC) dated April 21, 2006 and November 18, 2009 to October 5, 2010.  The Veteran has indicated that he received treatment at that facility shortly after discharge to include in a May 2005 written statement.  As such, the RO must seek all clinical records from the Kansas City VAMC from January 9, 1965 to November 17, 2009 and from October 6, 2010 to the present.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this claim is REMANDED to the RO/AMC for the following additional development and consideration:\r\n\r\n1.  Associate with the claims file all Kansas City VAMC clinical records dated from January 9, 1965 to November 17, 2009 and from October 6, 2010 to the present.\r\n\r\n2.  Next, schedule a VA mental disorders examination for a diagnosis of all extant acquired psychiatric disorders.  Regarding each such disorder diagnosed, the examiner must opine regarding whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent or greater likelihood) related to service.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner is directed to consider all pertinent documents in the claims file and the Veteran's reported history as well as other lay evidence of record to include a March 2007 written statement from his sister.  \r\n\r\nNote: As used above, the term \"at least as likely as not\" does not mean merely within the realm of medical possibility, but rather that the weight of medical evidence both for and against a conclusion is so evenly divided that it is as medically sound to find in favor of causation as it is to find against it.\r\n\r\nThe examination report must indicate whether the requested claims file review was accomplished.  All opinions are to be accompanied by a rationale consistent with the evidence of record.  If the requested medical opinion cannot be given, the examiner should state the reason(s) why.\r\n\r\n3.  Readjudicate the issue on appeal in light of this and all other additional evidence.  If the claim remains denied, send the Veteran and his representative a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) and give them opportunity to respond to it before returning the file to the Board for further appellate consideration of this claim.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument concerning this claim the Board is remanding.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2013).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nM.

Martinez, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from February 1967 to September 1969.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) from an August 2011 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO) in Nashville, Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's claim on appeal was previously characterized as a claim of service connection for PTSD.  The Board notes that the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that when a claimant identifies PTSD without more, it may not be considered a claim limited only to that diagnosis, but rather must be considered a claim for any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by several factors including the claimant's description of the claim, the symptoms the claimant describes, and the information the claimant submits or that VA obtains in support of the claim.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (finding that the claimant did not file a claim to receive benefits only for a particular diagnosis, but for the affliction or symptoms that his mental condition, whatever it is, causes him).  In an August 2011 VA examination, the Veteran reported having had panic attacks and intrusive thoughts, and the examiner noted signs of impulsivity, concentration problems, and hypervigilance.  Accordingly, the Veteran's claim is not limited solely to PTSD; rather, the claim is properly characterized broadly as a claim of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThere is no competent evidence that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, at any time during the appeals process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nAn acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, was not incurred or aggravated in service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1110, 1111, 1112, 1113, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309 (2013).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  Duties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nVA has a duty to notify and a duty to assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5103, 5103A (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.159, 3.326(a) (2013).\r\n\r\nProper notice from VA must inform the claimant and his representative, if any, prior to the initial unfavorable decision on a claim by the AOJ of any information and any medical or lay evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b); Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  These notice requirements apply to all five elements of a service-connection claim (veteran status, existence of a disability, a connection between the Veteran's service and the disability, degree of disability, and effective date of the disability).  Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).  Information that a disability rating and an effective date for the award of benefits will be assigned if service connection is awarded must be included.  Id.\r\n\r\nHere, neither the Veteran nor his representative has alleged prejudice with respect to notice, as is required.  See Shinseki v. Sanders, 129 S. Ct. 1696 (2009); Hartman v. Nicholson, 483 F.3d 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Goodwin v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 128 (2008); Dunlap v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 112 (2007).  None is found by the Board.  In June 2011, the Veteran was notified via letter of the criteria for establishing service connection, the evidence required in this regard, and his and VA's respective duties for obtaining evidence.  He was additionally notified of how VA determines disability ratings and effective dates if service connection is awarded.\r\n\r\nTherefore, adequate notice was provided to the Veteran prior to the transfer and recertification of his case to the Board and it complied with the requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b).\r\n\r\nThe Board also finds that the duty to assist requirement has been fulfilled.  All relevant, identified, and available evidence has been obtained; specifically, the Veteran's service treatment records and VA examination report are in the file.  The Veteran has not referred to any additional existing evidence that is necessary for a fair adjudication of the claim which has not been obtained.\r\n\r\nThe record reflects that the Veteran underwent a VA examination to evaluate his claimed PTSD in August 2011.  The report from that examination and the medical opinion have been included in the claims file for review.  This examination and opinion involved a review of the claims file, a thorough examination of the Veteran, and an opinion supported by rationale.  The Board finds that this examination is adequate.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007); see also Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).  \r\n\r\nThe Board concludes that VA has satisfied the duty to assist provisions of law.  No further notice or assistance to the Veteran is required to fulfill VA's duty to assist him in development.  Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143 (2001); Smith v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 227 (2000).\r\n\r\nII.  Service Connection\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he suffers from PTSD, and attributes it to exposure to traumatic events in Vietnam.  He recounts his building being hit my mortar fire, crawling to a bunker for safety, placing his hand on a large wound in a soldier's injured leg, and participating in the Tet Offensive.  He claims service connection is warranted.\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service.  To establish service connection for the claimed disorder, there must be medical evidence of a current disability; medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Service connection may also be granted for chronic disorders, such as psychoses, when manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1111, 1112, 1113 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309 (2013).  To make this decision, the Board must consider all the evidence of record and make appropriate determinations of competence, credibility, and weight.  See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005).\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the Veteran seeks service connection specifically for PTSD, entitlement to service connection for PTSD in particular requires medical evidence diagnosing PTSD in accordance with the American Psychiatric Association  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (1994) (DSM-IV); a link-established by medical evidence- between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. �� 3.304(f) ; 4.125(a).\r\n\r\nWhen VA determines that a veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy, or that a veteran did engage in combat with the enemy but the claimed stressor is not related to such combat, such veteran's lay testimony, by itself, will not be enough to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.  Instead, the record must contain evidence that corroborates a veteran's account as to the occurrence of the claimed stressor.   See 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d), (f) (2013); Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  Evidence denoting participation in combat includes award of decorations such as the Combat Action Ribbon, Combat Infantryman Badge (CIB), Purple Heart Medal, and decorations such as the Bronze Star Medal that have been awarded with a Combat \"V\" device.\r\n\r\nRegarding the corroboration of stressors, the Board notes the recent amendment to 38 C.F.R. � 3.304 concerning stressors based on a veteran's \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.\"  Specifically, the amendment provides that, if a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to the veteran's \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" and if a VA or a VA-contracted psychiatrist or psychologist confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor, so long as there is not clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service.  Stressor Determinations for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, 75 Fed. Reg. 39,843, 39,852 (July 13, 2010) (to be codified at 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3); 75 Fed. Reg. 41 ,092 (July 14, 2010) (correcting the effective date of the rule published on July 13, 2010).  For purposes of this section, \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" means that \"a veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the veteran or others . . . and the veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror.\"  75 Fed. Reg. at 39,852.\r\n\r\nThe threshold requirement for the granting of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD under either the former or amended regulations, is evidence of a current disability.  In other words, in the absence of evidence of a current disability, in this matter a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD according to the DSM-IV, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer  v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). The Court has held that the requirement in a claim of service connection of current disability \"is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim and that a claimant may be granted service connection even though the disability resolves prior to the Secretary's adjudication of the claim.\"  See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007).\r\n\r\nFirst, the Board notes that the Veteran underwent an August 2011 VA psychiatric examination in which the examiner found in-service stressors of a fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, during the Veteran's service in Vietnam.  The Veteran's DD 214 shows that his military occupational specialty (MOS) was that of a postal clerk.  The Veteran's records do not confirm the receipt of any decorations or medals denoting participation in combat.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, even if the Veteran's stressors were to be conceded, upon thorough review of the claim file, the Board finds that the record does not support a finding that the Veteran suffers a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, at any time during the appeals period.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that a chronic psychiatric disorder was treated or diagnosed during service or after service.  The Veteran's November 1966 enlistment examination and September 1969 separation examination both revealed a clinically normal psychiatric examination.  In addition, there is no indication in any of his service treatment records that he was treated for symptoms consistent with, or diagnosed with, a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.  Indeed, in the August 2011 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he did not seek or receive psychiatric treatment before, during, or after service.  Furthermore, in an August 2008 VA PTSD screening, the Veteran denied feeling numb or detached from others, or being constantly on guard, watchful, or easily startled; the PTSD screening was negative.\r\n\r\nIn the August 2011 VA examination, the examiner reviewed the claims file and considered the Veteran's description of stressful events in service as well as his reports of panic attacks, impulsivity, and intrusive thoughts.  Nonetheless, following a thorough examination of the Veteran, the examiner found that the Veteran demonstrated stable and adequate psychosocial functioning, and reported good relationships with family and friends.  The examiner concluded that although the Veteran described symptoms of PTSD, he did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, or for any psychiatric disorder.\r\n\r\nIn light of the clinical findings of the August 2011 VA examination and the absence of favorable competent medical evidence of record showing a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD. \r\n\r\nIn reaching the above conclusion, the Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements that he has PTSD.  The Veteran is competent to testify as to his observations.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  But, the Veteran has not demonstrated that he is an expert when it comes to diagnosis or etiology of psychiatric disorders; he is therefore a layperson in this regard.  Lay witnesses may, in some circumstances, opine on questions of diagnosis and etiology.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  However, unlike disorders that may be observable as to both their incurrence and their cause, such as a dislocated shoulder, the diagnosis and cause of a psychiatric disorder, including PTSD, is not readily apparent to lay observation, and the Court has held that psychiatric diagnoses are generally the province of medical professionals.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 6 (2009) (\"It is generally the province of medical professionals to diagnose or label a mental condition, not the claimant\"); see also Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007) (unlike varicose veins or a dislocated shoulder, rheumatic fever is not a condition capable of lay diagnosis).  Moreover, even if credible and competent as to his observations, the Veteran's general lay assertions are outweighed by the specific and reasoned conclusions of the health care professional who found no diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, including PTSD.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning; threshold considerations include the qualifications of the person opining).  Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran's lay opinion is not entitled to significant weight as compared to the August 2011 VA opinion.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the most probative evidence of record reflects that the Veteran lacks a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, including PTSD under the DSM-IV, during the appeals period.  See Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 69-70 (1993).  Absent the required diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, including a DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD, at any time during the appeals period, there is no current disability to attribute to the Veteran's military service, irrespective of the occurrence of a stressor in service.  See Maggitt v. West, 202 F.3d 1370, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2000); D'Amico  v. West, 209 F.3d 132, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Collaro v. West, 136 F.3d 1304, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Hibbard v. West, 13 Vet. App. 546, 548 (2000).  The law limits entitlement for service-related diseases and injuries to cases where the underlying in-service incident has resulted in a disability.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328 (1997); see also Brammer  v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, and the claim must be denied.  The Board has considered the benefit of the doubt doctrine, but finds it inapplicable because the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107; 38 C.F.R. � 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990).\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nMICHAEL MARTIN\r\nVeterans Law Judge, Board of Veterans' Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"5bec3ada8102470b4a1117dd","name":"1409108.txt","plainText":"Citation Nr: 1409108\t\r\nDecision Date: 03/04/14    Archive Date: 03/12/14\r\n\r\nDOCKET NO.  03-14 363\t)\tDATE\r\n\t)\r\n\t)\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Reno, Nevada\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, other than posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including major depression.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nAppellant represented by:\tDisabled American Veterans\r\n\r\n\r\nWITNESS AT HEARINGS ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nAppellant\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nJ. Smith, Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from June 1972 to June 1975.\r\n\r\nThis appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2002 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Appeals (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Reno, Nevada. \r\n\r\nIn May 2005, the Veteran testified at a hearing held at the RO before another Veterans Law Judge (VLJ).  A transcript of the hearing has been associated with the Veteran's claims file. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was subsequently notified that the May 2005 VLJ was no longer employed by the Board and was afforded the opportunity for a new hearing; he elected to take the opportunity.  \r\n\r\nIn September 2008, the Veteran testified during a videoconference hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge; a transcript of that hearing is of record.  \r\n\r\nIn October 2010, the Board remanded the claim for additional development.\r\n\r\nIn August 2012, the Board denied the claim.  The Veteran appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  \r\n\r\nIn March 2013, the Court vacated the August 2012 Board decision and remanded the matter back to the Board for development consistent with the parties' Joint Motion for Remand and to Stay Proceedings (Joint Motion).\r\n\r\nThe Board has considered documentation included in the Virtual VA and VBMS systems in reaching the determinations below.  Virtual VA contains a brief from the Veteran's representative; the remaining documents are duplicative of those in the paper file.  VBMS does not contain any documents.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Board's August 2012 decision was vacated due to outstanding VA treatment records from the Long Beach VA Medical Center (VAMC) and Las Vegas VAMC.  The most recent records from Law Vegas are dated from November 2007, and the Board cannot point to treatment records from Long Beach.\r\n\r\nThe parties further suggested that a current VA examination may be needed, based on the complete claims file, to include a review of the above-referenced records.  The Board will remand the matter accordingly.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1. The RO should obtain all treatment records from the Long Beach VAMC, and records dated since November 2007 from the Las Vegas VAMC.\r\n\r\nIf no records can be obtained, VA's efforts must be documented, and compliance with the requirements of 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(e)(i)-(iv) (2013) must be achieved.\r\n\r\n2.  After any additional records are associated with the claims file, the Veteran should be afforded a VA psychiatric examination to address the nature and likely etiology of any psychiatric disorder other than PTSD.  The examiner is to be provided access to the paper file, Virtual VA, and VBMS as needed.  Any and all indicated studies deemed necessary by the examiner should be accomplished.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner is requested to offer comments and an opinion addressing whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent probability or greater) that any psychiatric disorder other than PTSD is due to an injury or other event or incident of the Veteran's period of active service.  \r\n\t\r\nAll opinions should be supported by a clear rationale, and a discussion of the facts and medical principles involved would be of considerable assistance to the Board.  \r\n\r\n3.  The Veteran is to be notified that it is his responsibility to report for VA examination and to cooperate in the development of the claim.  The consequences for failure to report for a VA examination without good cause may include denial of the claim.  38 C.F.R. �� 3.158, 3.655 (2013).\r\n  \r\n4.

Anderson, Associate Counsel \r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThis appeal was processed using the Virtual VA paperless claims processing system.  Accordingly, any future consideration of this appellant's case should take into consideration the existence of this electronic record.\r\n\r\nPlease note this appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c) (2013).  38 U.S.C.A. � 7107(a)(2) (West 2002).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active military service from February 1953 to December 1954.  \r\n\r\nIn December 2011, the Veteran testified during a Board videoconference hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ).  A transcript of that hearing is included in the claims file.  \r\n\r\nIn an April 2013 decision, the Board denied the Veteran's appeal.  The Veteran appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In October 2013, the Court granted a joint motion (Joint Motion) of the Veteran and the Secretary of VA, vacated the April 2013 decision, and remanded the matter to the Board for compliance with the instructions in the Joint Motion.  \r\n\r\nThis appeal is REMANDED to the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn the October 2013 Joint Motion (JMR), it was noted that during the Veteran's December 1, 2011 hearing he commented that he was in receipt of ongoing treatment for PTSD at the Houma VA Outpatient Clinic.  \r\n\r\nIn April 2013, the record contained records from the Houma VA Outpatient Clinic, but they only covered a period up to 2008.  \r\n\r\nImportantly, the Veteran's attorney has not submitted these records himself (an effort that could have greatly reduced the delay in the full adjudication of this case given the Veteran's age and the fact that the JMR was in October 20013). \r\n\r\nIn this regard, it is important for the Veteran to understand that the fact that the Veteran was being treated for PTSD is not in dispute.  The indispensable query is not treatment for PTSD, or a diagnosis of PTSD, but the Veteran's stressors in service.\r\n\r\nIn any event, per the October 2013 Joint Motion, this case must be remanded to allow the Agency of Original Jurisdiction additional opportunity to obtain the Veteran's treatment records from the Houma VA Outpatient Clinic for the period 2008 to the present.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(2) (2013).  \r\n\r\nTo avoid further delay, and to give the Veteran every consideration, upon receipt of such records, the VA will provide the Veteran with a VA psychiatric evaluation to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's PTSD, if any.  See generally McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n(Please note, this appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c) (2013).  Expedited handling is requested.)\r\n\r\n1.  Obtain all outstanding VA treatment records and reports from the Houma VA Outpatient Clinic.  Specifically, records for the period from January 2008 to the present should be obtained.  Efforts to obtain these records must be associated with the claims file and requests for these records must continue until the AOJ determines that the records sought do not exist or that further efforts to obtain those records would be futile.\r\n\r\n2.  Then, schedule the Veteran for a comprehensive VA psychiatric examination to obtain a current diagnosis including the severity of the Veteran's PTSD (if any), and to determine the nature and etiology of such diagnosis.  The entire claims file (i.e. the paper claims file, to include a copy of this REMAND, and any medical records contained in Virtual VA, CAPRI, and AMIE) must be reviewed by the examiner in conjunction with the examination.  If the examiner does not have access to Virtual VA, any relevant treatment records contained in Virtual VA file that are not available on CAPRI or AMIE must be printed and associated with the paper claims file so they can be available to the examiner for review.  The examination report should reflect that such a review was accomplished.  \r\n\r\nThe diagnosis must be based on examination findings, all available medical records, a complete review of comprehensive testing for PTSD, and all appropriate tests and studies should be conducted, and any consultations deemed necessary should be accomplished.  A multiaxial evaluation based on the current DSM-IV diagnostic criteria is required.  \r\n\r\nAfter a review of the file, the examiner is asked to complete the following: \r\n\r\nWhether it is at least as likely as not (a 50% or greater chance) that the Veteran currently suffers from PTSD related to his fear of hostile military or terrorist activity while on active duty, and whether it is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD.  \r\n\r\nFor purposes of this paragraph, \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" means that a Veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the Veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the Veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror.  \r\n\r\nIf PTSD is found, the event that caused the PTSD should be clearly stated in order that a factual determination may be made regarding the authenticity of the event or events cited by the examiner. \r\n\r\nAll opinions and conclusions expressed must be supported by a complete rationale in a report.  The examiner should reconcile any opinions with the service treatment records, post-service medical evidence, and lay statements of the Veteran.  If an opinion cannot be rendered without resorting to speculation, the examiner should discuss in detail why an opinion cannot be offered.  A complete rationale for all opinions expressed must be provided. \r\n\r\n3.  After completion of the above, the RO/AMC should adjudicate entitlement to service connection for PTSD, to include under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) (2013). \r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2013).\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nJOHN J.

Poulson, Counsel\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active service from October 1985 to October 1987.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2007 decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO), in Nashville, Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has been diagnosed with numerous psychiatric disorders over the years, to include panic attacks, agoraphobia, anxiety disorder, depression, panic disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder.  In August 2008, the Veteran withdrew his claim of service connection for PTSD.  The issue has been recharacterized as noted on the title page given the nature of the Veteran's claim and the medical evidence of record.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (the scope of a claim pursued by a claimant includes any diagnosis that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record).\r\n \r\nIn August 2008, the Veteran testified at a hearing before a Decision Review Officer (DRO).  In August 2011, he testified at a video conference hearing before the undersigned Acting Veterans Law Judge.  During the Board hearing, the Veteran submitted additional evidence along with a waiver of initial RO consideration.  Transcripts of both hearings are associated with the claims file.\r\n\r\nThis matter was previously before the Board in November 2011 at which time it was remanded for additional development.  It is now returned to the Board. \r\n\r\nIn correspondence dated in June 2013, the Veteran indicated that he wished to open a \"pension claim with aid and attendance.\"  This issue has not been adjudicated by the agency of original jurisdiction.  Therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction over it, and it is referred to the agency of original jurisdiction for appropriate action.  \r\nIn addition to the paper claims file, there is a Virtual VA paperless claims file associated with the Veteran's claim.  A review of the documents in such file reveals that they are either duplicative of the evidence in the paper claims file or are irrelevant to the issue on appeal.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nAfter carefully considering this matter, and for reasons expressed immediately below, the Board believes that this case must be remanded for further development of the record.  The Board regrets the delay associated with this remand, especially considering that this matter was the subject of a previous remand.  However, another remand is necessary to ensure that the Veteran is accorded full compliance with the statutory duty to assist. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he developed a psychiatric disability as a result of being sexually assaulted, and subsequently harassed, by a higher ranking service member. \r\nThe Veteran provides a competent and credible account of an in-service sexual assault and subsequent harassment.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  During the above hearings, he asserted that the sexual assault took place at Fort Drum, New York, sometime between March and August 1987 while he was stationed with the 10th Mountain Division.  He contends that the service member subsequently harassed him, and that this went on for many months until August 1997, at which time he took terminal leave and \"got away from him.\"  \r\n\r\nService personnel records confirm the Veteran's assignment to the stated unit and duty station at the time of the claimed sexual assault.  The records show that he was promoted in March 1987 and was found to be suitable for security clearance.  He was discharged from active duty in August 1987, and took terminal leave for 30 days prior to his October 1987 discharge.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records are missing, and attempts to obtain them through alternate sources have been exhausted.  See February 2008 Formal Finding on the Unavailability of Service Medical Records.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's former spouse, who was married to the Veteran at the time of the claimed assault, as well as the Veteran's mother, have provided competent and credible sworn testimony pertaining to a change in the Veteran's behavior shortly after his discharge from service.  These statements tend to bolster the credibility of the Veteran's account.  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds the evidence as a whole renders the Veteran's statements as to these matters competent, credible and highly probative and sufficient to corroborate his in-service sexual assault.  See Buchanan, supra; see also Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (finding that VA must consider lay evidence, but may give it whatever weight it concludes the evidence is entitled to).  Thus, the Board resolves all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and concedes the sexual assault and subsequent harassment. \r\n\r\nHowever, the etiology of any current psychiatric disability remains unclear.  The Veteran contends that he has suffered from panic attacks ever since service.  He maintains that he sought treatment from various providers for chest pain beginning shortly after discharge.  Post-service private treatment records establish that the Veteran sought medical treatment for various symptoms, to include chest pain, from 1988 to the early 1990's.  Unfortunately, those records are largely illegible.  In October 1994, a private doctor diagnosed panic disorder, which the Veteran reportedly attributed to a motor vehicle accident.  (The Board notes that the Veteran has denied making this statement.  See DRO Hearing Transcript at 2.)  An October 1997 Social Security Association decision reflects that the Veteran was awarded disability benefits based on a primary disability of panic attacks.  An April 1996 disability examination report shows that the Veteran reportedly started having panic attacks in March 1988 after he sustained a chest injury while working for the Army Corps of Engineers.  January 1999 private treatment records show that the Veteran reported no significant mental problems until he was fired from the Army Corps of Engineers after sustaining the chest injury, and that he alluded to possible sexual abuse as a child.  An April 2001 Social Security Administration questionnaire shows that the Veteran attributed his panic attacks and chest pain to the post-service chest injury.  VA treatment records dated from January 2006 to August 2010 show that the Veteran has been treated for panic attacks with agoraphobia.  In January 2007, his VA treating psychiatrist indicated that the Veteran's anxiety \"originated from-->emotional abuse he experienced back in service.\" \r\n\r\nThe Veteran submitted to a VA mental disorders examination in December 2011, which included a discussion of the in-service sexual assault and the Veteran's post-service symptomatology.  The examiner reviewed the claims file and gave an Axis I diagnosis of panic attacks, but found no evidence of a service connected mental disorder.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's presentation and verbal report was \"suggestive of a primary characterological disorder rather than a mood or anxiety disorder.\"  The examiner recognized that the Veteran \"may indeed experience significant anxiety at times, including panic attacks or phobic responses.\"  However, she determined that these symptoms are \"primarily linked to maladaptive personality traits.\"  The Board finds that the December 2011 opinion is confusing, contradictory, and inadequate for service connection purposes.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (VA must provide an examination that is adequate for rating purposes).  Thus, another examination and opinion should be obtained regarding the etiology of any psychiatric disability that the Veteran may be found to have.  See 38 C.F.R. � 5103A; 38 C.F.R. � 3.159; Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998) (the Board is obligated by law to ensure that the RO complies with its directives).\r\n\r\nFinally, as this matter is being remanded for the reasons set forth above, any additional VA treatment records of the Veteran for his asserted psychiatric disorder should also be obtained.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(b), (c); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b); see also Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992) (VA medical records are in constructive possession of the agency, and must be obtained if the material could be determinative of the claim). \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  The agency of original jurisdiction shall ask the Veteran to identify all locations of VA treatment or evaluation for his asserted disability and contact each VA medical facility identified by the Veteran to obtain ongoing medical treatment records pertaining thereto.  All records obtained must be associated with the Veteran's claims file\r\n\r\n2.  The agency of original jurisdiction shall schedule the Veteran for a VA mental disorders examination by an appropriate physician other than the examiner who conducted the December 2011 examination.  The purpose of the examination is to determine the nature, extent, and etiology of any psychiatric disorder that the Veteran has.  \r\n\r\nThe claims file, including all newly obtained evidence and a copy of this remand, must be made available to the examiner in conjunction with the examination.  A notation to the effect that this review has taken place should be made in the evaluation report.  All indicated tests and studies should be performed.  All pertinent psychiatric pathology should be noted in the examination report.\r\n\r\nFor any psychiatric disability diagnosed on examination, the examiner should determine whether it is at least as likely as not that any such disability either had its onset during the Veteran's active service, was manifested to a compensable degree within one year from separation from service, or is otherwise etiologically related to his active service.\r\n\r\nThe examiner must specifically address all relevant post-service treatment records.  In addition, the examiner should assume that, as the Veteran has asserted, he was the victim of a sexual assault and subsequent harassment during service.\r\n\r\nThe absence of evidence of treatment for a psychiatric disorder in the Veteran's service treatment records cannot, standing alone, serve as the basis for a negative opinion.\r\n\r\nIf the examiner is unable to provide an opinion without resort to speculation, he or she should explain why this is so and what if any additional evidence would be necessary before an opinion could be rendered. The examiner must provide a rationale for each opinion given.\r\n\r\n3.  The agency of original jurisdiction will then review the Veteran's claims file and ensure that the foregoing development actions have been conducted and completed in full, and that no other notification or development action, in addition to those directed above, is required.  If further action is required, it should be undertaken prior to further claims adjudication.\r\n\r\n4.  The agency of original jurisdiction will then readjudicate the Veteran's claim.  If the benefit sought on appeal remains denied, the Veteran and his representative shall be provided with a Supplemental Statement of the Case.  An appropriate period of time shall be allowed for response.\r\nThereafter, if appropriate, the case is to be returned to the Board, following applicable appellate procedure.  The Veteran need take no action until he is so informed.  He has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).  The purposes of this remand are to obtain additional information and comply with all due process considerations.  No inference should be drawn regarding the final disposition of this claim as a result of this action.\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Casadei, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from February 1971 to January 1975. \r\n\r\nProcedurally, the claims for service connection for PTSD and service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD were before the Board in May 2012.  In that decision, the Board denied service connection for PTSD and remanded the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran appealed the denial of service connection for PTSD to the Veterans Claims Court.  In August 2013, the Court Clerk granted a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR), vacating the Board's May 2012 decision on PTSD and remanded the issue to the Board for additional development.  \r\n\r\nWhile the claim for service connection for PTSD was on appeal at the Court, the RO granted service connection for depressive disorder (claimed as an acquired psychiatric disorder and formerly claimed as PTSD) and assigned a 30 percent rating, effective May 1, 2005.  \r\n\r\nThe claim for PTSD remained on appeal because separately diagnosed psychiatric conditions, such as PTSD and acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD (namely depressive disorder) here, can be service-connected.  See Amberman v. Shinseki, 570 F.3d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (noting that different psychiatric diagnoses may have symptoms that are not overlapping).  \r\n\r\nThat notwithstanding, they cannot be separately evaluated unless they result in different psychiatric manifestations.  Id; 38 C.F.R. � 4.14 (\"the evaluation of the same manifestation under different diagnoses is to be avoided\" because it is pyramiding).  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC) in Washington, DC.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nPursuant to the JMR, the claim for service connection for PTSD is remanded for additional development.  Specifically, the Veteran has asserted that he was in an aircraft over Vietnam which came under enemy missile attack, and he was involved in a secret Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) mission in Laos which involved insertion and recovery of a special operations team.  He provided information that the aircraft involved may have included the EC-135 and the KC-135.  He also notified VA in a psychotherapy setting that the CIA may have released information regarding its operations in Laos during the relevant time period.  \r\n\r\nUpon review of the record, there is no indication that the RO or the U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) or its associate agencies contacted the CIA for any relevant information it may have regarding the Veteran and his reported military activities.  As such, on remand, an inquiry to the CIA should be made.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  Contact the Veteran and request that he submit any additional information regarding his reported military activities, to include lay statements concerning the time, place, and circumstances of the claimed in-service stressor event(s).\r\n\r\n2.  Then, contact the CIA (and any other appropriate agency) to request information regarding a CIA mission in Laos which involved insertion and recovery of a special operations team.  \r\n\r\nDocument the attempts to obtain such information.  If the AMC/RO is unable to obtain any pertinent evidence from the CIA or related agencies, or if any records are unavailable, do not exist, or further attempts to obtain them would be futile, document this fact in the claims file. All such available documents should be associated with the claims folder or Virtual VA folder (as appropriate). \r\n\r\n3.  After ensuring that the development is complete, re-adjudicate the claim.  If not fully granted, issue a supplemental statement of the case to the Veteran and his representative before returning the claim to the Board.  Afford him the opportunity to submit written or other argument in response thereto before returning the claim to the Board, if otherwise in order.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

B. Yantz, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active duty service from July 1963 to January 1965.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2011 rating decision by a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  A notice of disagreement was received in March 2012, a statement of the case was issued in December 2012, and a substantive appeal was received in January 2013.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the current claim of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder was previously characterized by the RO as service connection for PTSD.  However, as the record documents the psychiatric diagnoses of PTSD as well as MDD during the period of the current claim, the Board has recharacterized the claim as indicated on the title page to afford the Veteran the broadest scope of review.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5-6 (2009).\r\n\r\nThe Board has reviewed the claims file, Virtual VA, and the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) to ensure that the complete record is considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The evidence reasonably establishes that the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD related to stressors in service that have been corroborated by credible supporting evidence.\r\n\r\n2.  The evidence reasonably establishes that the Veteran's MDD is causally related to her corroborated stressors in service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\n1.  The Veteran's PTSD was incurred in active service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102, 3.303, 3.304(f) (2013).\r\n\r\n2.  The Veteran's MDD was incurred in active service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303 (2013).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nThe VCAA, in part, describes VA's duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a).  The VCAA applies to the instant claim for service connection.  However, in light of the granting of service connection for PTSD and for MDD, further discussion of the VCAA is not necessary.\r\n\r\nLaws and Regulations\r\n\r\nService connection will be granted if it is shown that the Veteran suffers from a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty, during active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  Disorders diagnosed after discharge will still be service connected if all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d); see also Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994).\r\n\r\nEstablishing service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) a disease; injury, or event in service and (3) a nexus between the claimed disability and the disease, injury, or event in service and the present disability.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) (conforming with the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV)); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nIf a PTSD claim is based on in-service personal assault, then evidence from sources other than the Veteran's service records may corroborate the Veteran's account of the stressor incident, such as: records from law enforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases; statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy; and evidence of behavior changes following the claimed assault (including a request for a transfer to another military duty assignment; deterioration in work performance; substance abuse; episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable cause; or unexplained economic or social behavior changes).  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(5).\r\n\r\nCompetent medical evidence is evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions.  Competent medical evidence may include statements conveying sound medical principles found in medical treatises.  Competent medical evidence may include statements contained in authoritative writings, such as medical and scientific articles and research reports or analyses.  38 C.F.R. � 3.159(a)(1).\r\n\r\nCompetent lay evidence is any evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience.  Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person.  38 C.F.R. � 3.159(a)(2).  This may include some medical matters, such as describing symptoms or relating a contemporaneous medical diagnosis.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).\r\n\r\nIn determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that it has reviewed all of the evidence in the record, with an emphasis on the evidence relevant to this appeal.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, every piece of evidence of record.  Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (VA must review the entire record, but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence).  Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence as appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claim being decided.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that she suffers from PTSD and MDD as a result of sexual trauma incidents in service.  Specifically, she has provided consistent details throughout the record regarding how she was forcibly raped on one occasion by a male sergeant (in 1964), and how she endured attempted rape on two other occasions (once by another male sergeant, and once by a male superior) as well as ongoing sexual harassment from these and other men.  She alleges that she never reported any of the aforementioned incidents in service due to fear of retaliation as well as due to lack of information about how to report such crimes.  She contends that, after these incidents occurred, she asked to be transferred to another office, and thereafter she purposely allowed herself to get pregnant by another airman so that she could leave the service due to pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not document any complaints, findings, diagnosis, or treatment of PTSD, MDD, or any other acquired psychiatric disorder, nor do they contain any reference to the Veteran's alleged in-service sexual trauma incidents.  However, a December 1964 STR confirmed that she was pregnant (5 to 6 months along), and it was also noted at her January 1965 service separation examination that she was 26 to 27 weeks pregnant.  Her service personnel records confirmed that she was discharged in January 1965 for \"convenience of the government\" in light of her pregnancy.\r\n\r\nNearly 18 years after her service discharge, a VA hospital summary documented that the Veteran was hospitalized for six days in December 1982, with a diagnosis of psychotic neurosis (type undetermined), and was evaluated as having a \"hysterical personality\"; she did not make any mention of the in-service sexual trauma incidents at that time.\r\n\r\nThe record reflects that the Veteran first sought VA psychiatric treatment for her military sexual trauma incidents in June 2008.  Subsequent VA treatment records have documented her ongoing treatment for the diagnosed disabilities of PTSD and MDD as a result of these in-service stressor incidents.  In particular, in a February 2010 VA treatment record, a VA social worker noted that the Veteran met the criteria for PTSD related to military sexual trauma.  (The Board notes that, while \"anxiety\" is listed on her VA problem list, she has never been diagnosed with any formal anxiety disorder.)\r\n\r\nIn statements submitted in July 2010 and November 2010, the Veteran's granddaughter and daughters described the psychological symptoms they had witnessed in the Veteran (including outbursts during nightmares) over many years, and how the Veteran had finally admitted to them recently that such symptoms were related to the sexual trauma stressor incidents she had endured while in service.\r\n\r\nOn VA PTSD examination in October 2012, the Veteran described her military sexual trauma incidents (as outlined above), and the examiner (a VA clinical psychologist) determined that such stressors were adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD and with MDD (recurrent, in full remission), and noted that the diagnoses of PTSD and MDD were comorbid and related.  The examiner went on to state that the diagnosis of PTSD was a \"historical diagnosis\" and that the Veteran did not currently meet the full criteria for PTSD at the present time, as the Veteran's treatment (including group therapy from VA) had been very successfully and thus had significantly reduced her current symptoms.  The examiner opined that the \"Veteran's (historical) PTSD is most likely caused by a result of sexual trauma/rape while in the military.\"  In a November 2012 addendum, the examiner reiterated that the Veteran did not currently meet the full criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of record establishes that the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD and MDD related to in-service sexual trauma incidents that have been corroborated by credible supporting evidence.  Her service records confirm that she became pregnant in 1964, which resulted in her honorable discharge in January 1965; she has alleged that she became pregnant purposely so that she could be discharged.  She has consistently reported her military sexual trauma incidents and has been diagnosed with both PTSD and MDD throughout the period of the current claim.  The Veteran's granddaughter and daughters have also shared their personal accounts of the Veteran's psychological symptoms as a result of her military stressors.  Although the October 2012 VA examiner determined that the Veteran did not meet all of the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis at the time of that examination, the examiner nevertheless acknowledged that the Veteran had been diagnosed (historically) with PTSD during the course of her VA psychiatric treatment, which began in 2008 and continued throughout the period of the current claim.  See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007) (the requirement of current disability is satisfied when the disability is shown at any point during the pendency of the claim, even if the disability subsequently resolves).  Furthermore, the October 2012 examiner noted that the Veteran's diagnoses of PTSD and MDD were comorbid and related, and opined that the Veteran's (historical) PTSD was most likely caused by a result of sexual trauma/rape while in the military.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(5).\r\n\r\nGiven the evidence outlined above, and after resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's PTSD and MDD (which were both diagnosed during the period of the current claim) are causally related to stressors in service that have been corroborated by credible supporting evidence.  Therefore, the Board concludes that service connection for PTSD and for MDD is warranted.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is warranted.  Entitlement to service connection for MDD is warranted.  The appeal is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nALAN S.

Caylor, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active military service from August 2001 to June 2004 and service in the Army Reserve.\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2008 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Los Angeles, California.\r\n\r\nThe Board previously remanded this case for development in July 2012.\r\n\r\nThis appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c).  38 U.S.C.A. � 7107(a)(2) (West 2002).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  An August 2002 performance evaluation reveals a deterioration in work performance and corroborates the Veteran's claimed military sexual trauma.\r\n\r\n2.  The Veteran's claimed fear of hostile military and terrorist activity is consistent with the time, place, type, and circumstances of her service in Iraq in 2004.\r\n\r\n3.  In July 2013, a VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD, determined that both stressors were adequate to support the diagnosis, and attributed the Veteran's mental health symptoms solely to her PTSD.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303, 3.304(f) (2013).\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nK.

Kreitlow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active military service from June 1965 to August 1972, including two tours of duty in the Republic of Vietnam.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2007 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Houston, Texas, which denied service connection for PTSD and entitlement to nonservice-connected pension.  Subsequently, in an August 2010 rating decision, entitlement to nonservice-connected pension was granted.  As that was a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal, that claim is no longer on appeal to the Board.  Thus the only remaining issue on appeal is that listed on the title page of this decision.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has claimed service connection for PTSD.  Construing the claim liberally, however, the Board finds that it should be characterized as one for service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (per curiam order) (it is the responsibility of the Board to consider alternate current conditions within the scope of the claim).  The issue is thus restated on the title page of this decision.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The medical and lay evidence of record fails to demonstrate the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\n2.  The Veteran's depressive and anxiety symptoms are more likely than not related to his polysubstance abuse and/or dependence.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nA psychiatric disorder was not incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1112, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2013); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304 (2013).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  Notice and Assistance Requirements\r\n\r\nVA's duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits are described in 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107 and 5126; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326(a).  Appropriate notice was provided in July 2007, prior to the initial AOJ decision on his claim.  \r\n\r\nAll efforts have been made to obtain relevant, identified and available evidence, and VA has notified the Veteran of any evidence that could not be obtained.  VA, therefore, has made every reasonable effort to obtain all records relevant to the Veteran's claim.  The Veteran was afforded VA examination on his claim in May 2012.  The Board acknowledges that, at an Informal Conference held before a Decision Review Officer (DRO) at the RO in February 2014, the Veteran and his representative argued that the May 2012 VA examination was inadequate.  The Veteran's main contention was that he did not know what to say during the examination.  The DRO told the Veteran and his representative that he did not find the VA examination to be inadequate for rating purposes on its face and it is consistent with other evidence of record.  The Board agrees.  The report of this examination reflects that the examiner reviewed the Veteran's past medical history, recorded his current complaints, conducted appropriate examination, and rendered appropriate diagnoses and opinions consistent with the remainder of the evidence of record.  The Board, therefore, concludes that this examination report is adequate for purposes of rendering a decision in the instant appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. � 4.2; see also Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).  \r\n\r\nThus, the Board finds that VA has satisfied its duties to inform and assist the Veteran at every stage of this case.  Additional efforts to assist or notify him would serve no useful purpose.  Therefore, he will not be prejudiced as a result of the Board proceeding to the merits of his claim. \r\n\r\nII.  Analysis\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).  Service connection generally requires credible and competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) requires that diagnoses of mental disorders conform to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).\r\n\r\nIn making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record.  A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).  Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  When considering whether lay evidence is competent the Board must determine, on a case by case basis, whether the veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed.Cir.2009); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).\r\n\r\nThe Board is charged with the duty to assess the credibility and weight given to evidence.  Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1046 (1998); Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 367 (2001).  \r\n\r\nAs a finder of fact, when considering whether lay evidence is satisfactory, the Board may also properly consider internal inconsistency of the statements, facial plausibility, consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the veteran, and the veteran's demeanor when testifying at a hearing.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 38 (2007); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996). \r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he currently has PTSD that is due to his service in the Republic of Vietnam.  \r\n\r\nAlthough he claimed he has PTSD, the evidence of record fails to demonstrate that the Veteran has been given such a diagnosis.  VA treatment records show that the Veteran had a positive PTSD screen in February 2007.  On Mental Health consultation in March 2008, however, he was not diagnosed to have PTSD.  On assessment, the examining physician stated that the Veteran had some PTSD symptoms from Vietnam and a gunshot wound in 1989 but did not meet the full criteria for PTSD.  With regard to his service in Vietnam, the Veteran stated:  \" I don't know too much about Vietnam.  I don't think I have a lot of problems with that.  I don't think about it too much.  It's just things that happened in the past.\"  Also, when asked how his military service affected him, he answered:  \"It was a job.  I think I did a good job.\"  The physician also stated in assessing the Veteran that he had evidence of depressive symptoms, notably anhedonia, as well as a long history of alcohol dependence and a history of cocaine dependence.  The diagnoses given were alcohol dependence; rule out substance induced mood disorder versus anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified; and rule out dysthymic disorder.  \r\n\r\nOn follow up in May 2008, the Veteran reported that he did not feel depressed and denied anhedonia.  He also stated that his nerves bothered him in the morning but did not feel like he was too anxious most of the day.  He reported decreasing his alcohol intake from 6 16-oz beers a day to 1 to 2 16-oz beers.  The physician assessed the Veteran to have alcohol dependence with possible mild cognitive impairment.  The physician stated that it is likely his \"nerves\" in the morning were related to mild alcohol withdrawal.  The physician also considered it \"likely\" that the Veteran's sleep and anxiety problems were related to his alcohol use.\r\n\r\nOn follow up in July 2008, the Veteran reported doing \"fairly well.\"  The physician noted that the Veteran had mild anxiety and depressive symptoms.  However, no continued medication or mental health treatment were necessary, and the Veteran was discharged from the Mental Health Clinic.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, there was no additional mental health treatment until May 2012.  Depression and anxiety screens were negative.  The only mention of anxiety was related to a medical procedure the Veteran underwent in August 2010.  In May 2012, the Veteran was referred to Mental Health from the emergency room where he reported complaints of \"feeling depressed\" for about a day or so and requested help.  The Veteran did not report any symptoms of PTSD although he did report recent use of alcohol, cocaine and cannabis (within 24 hours prior).  When asked how his military service affected him, he did not answer.  It appears the Veteran was mostly concerned about his housing situation in that there was easy access to substances and he wanted to leave but he would be homeless if he did so.  The Veteran was diagnosed to have a substance induced mood disorder with depressive features and cocaine dependence.  \r\n\r\nIn May 2012, the Veteran was provided with an initial VA PTSD examination.  At that time, although the Veteran reported stressors of exposure to sniper fire, mortars and RPGs, the examiner stated that the reported stressors were not adequate to support the diagnosis of PTSD because the Veteran did not endorse significant distress associated with said experiences at the time.  He described the \"worst thing\" that happened to him as \"just being there;\" how he felt emotionally as \"some good days, some bad days;\" and elaborated that the bad days were when \"something didn't go right, ... something got misplaced.\"  He directly denied seeing any direct hit or witnessing death (either the event or aftermath, in contrast to his November 2007 stressor statement) nor any serious injury.  Consequently, the examiner found that there was no exposure to a traumatic event.  Furthermore, the examiner remarked that the traumatic event is not persistently re-experienced and there was no persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma or numbing of general responsiveness.  The Veteran did, however, report he avoids large crowds, cafes and clubs and endorsed persistent symptoms of increased arousal such as difficulty with concentration (noted to be endorsed on self-report instrument but denied verbally when asked and showed no evidence of on mental status examination) and difficulty falling or staying asleep.\r\n\r\nRather than PTSD symptoms, the examiner stated the Veteran reported having the following symptoms:  (1) depressed mood - not consistently, but when he has conflict with his daughter; recognizes he is not \"living up to his potential\"; and said his life has been going \"downhill\" since his wife died;  (2) anxiety - in that he experiences restlessness like he needs to be somewhere different and he smokes a cigarette, drinks and tries not to think about it and it mostly goes away; (3) panic attacks that occur weekly or less often (described as feeling like choking); (4) chronic sleep impairment - has bad dreams, wakes in a panic, trying to get away from something - present for last 10 to 20 years, also regularly wakes during middle of the night, awake for an hour or more, wakes again around 4:30 to 5:30 am, but also naps during the afternoon - last 10 plus years; (5) mild memory loss such as forgetting names, directions or recent events (said forgets day wife died, day got shot, wife's birthday) but no evidence of memory difficulty on examination; (6) impaired abstract thinking (gave concrete interpretation of proverb); (7) difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships (unstable living situation - living with cousin last month and was with unspecified other people for the previous year or so, work is irregular); (8) difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances including work or a work like setting; and (9) inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. The Veteran reported other symptoms to include fatigue, low energy and poor appetite.  \r\n\r\nAs a result of this examination, the examiner stated that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of PTSD that conforms to DSM-IV criteria.  Rather she diagnosed the Veteran to have polysubstance dependence (alcohol, cocaine and cannabis).  In rendering this diagnosis, the examiner stated that it was made primarily by review of medical records, including medical consequences of substances as the Veteran reported minimal to no significant negative consequences of drug/alcohol use and only acknowledged alcohol and crack cocaine use.  \r\n\r\nBased on the above evidence, the Board finds that the evidence fails to demonstrate that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD.  The Veteran's initial statement with his claim filed in March 2007 acknowledged that PTSD had not been diagnosed.  Significantly, his claim was made after the Veteran had a positive PTSD screen in February 2007 but prior to his initial Mental Health consultation in March 2008, which failed to result in a diagnosis of PTSD.  Likewise, no diagnosis of PTSD was rendered as a result of the May 2012 VA examination.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran stated at the February 2014 DRO informal conference that he did not know what to say at the examination but finds this not a reason to find the examination to be inadequate as it is clearly consistent with the Veteran's prior assessment for PTSD conducted in March 2008 and May 2007.  Furthermore, it is clear from the March 2008 Mental Health consultation note that the Veteran was asked specific questions relating to PTSD; however, he did not relate sufficient stressors and symptoms to warrant a diagnosis of PTSD.  Likewise, at the May 2012 VA examination, the examiner would have asked specific questions intended to illicit evidence of PTSD stressors and symptoms; however, the Veteran again failed to reply sufficiently to establish the presence of PTSD.  The Veteran's statement to the DRO that he did not know what to say at the VA examination only makes his report thereat more credible and persuasive because his responses to the examiner's questions would have been without any inherent bias that would have been there had he known what to say.  \r\n\r\nAs for the evidence indicating the Veteran has depressive and anxiety symptoms, the evidence demonstrates that these symptoms are more likely than not related to his long history of alcohol dependence and polysubstance abuse rather than his military service.  The Veteran has failed to relate his depressive and anxiety symptoms to his military service.  Rather he reported having depression relating to conflict with his daughter (see May 2012 VA examination report); when he fails to accomplish certain things (see March 2008 Mental Health consultation note); and due to his housing situation (see May 2012 Mental Health Triage note).  As for anxiety, he has stated he feels a little anxious when things are not going well (see March 2008 Mental Health consultation note) or in the mornings when he wakes up (see March 2008 Mental Health consultation note, May 2008 Mental Health note, and May 2012 VA examination report).  More importantly, in the May 2008 Mental Health note, the treating provider stated that the Veteran's anxiety and sleep problems are likely related to his alcohol dependence (notably the Veteran denied depression at that time so the opinion did not address that).  In July 2008, the Veteran only had mild depressive and anxiety symptoms and was discharged from Mental Health without medication as his symptoms were not severe enough to warrant additional mental health treatment.  In addition, VA treatment records subsequent to July 2008 (the last Mental Health follow up note for treatment starting in March 2008) fail to demonstrate that the Veteran continued to have depression and/or anxiety as multiple screens were negative and he failed to report any depression or anxiety symptoms when interviewed for homeless veteran housing in February 2013.  Furthermore, the May 2012 Mental Health Triage note shows a diagnosis of substance induced mood disorder with depressive features and the Veteran reported his main problem at that time was his housing situation and the potential for being homeless.  \r\n\r\nConsequently, the only evidence of record that indicates the Veteran has PTSD is his own statements to that effect.  A diagnosis of PTSD or any other psychiatric disorder requires that specific criteria set forth in the DSM-IV are met.  Thus, such a determination requires medical expertise and knowledge of the DSM-IV.  A lay person is, therefore, not competent to render a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder because such requires specific medical expertise and knowledge.  As such, the Veteran's lay statements not competent for the purposes of rendering a diagnosis of a particular psychiatric disorder.  His statements to the effect that he has PTSD, therefore, lack probative value.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, insofar as the Veteran has stated he has certain symptoms in statements made in support of his claim, the May 2012 VA examiner clearly considered those statements as demonstrated by his comments of the differences between what the Veteran reported at the examination and his statements made in support of his claim.  Clearly the examiner found that the Veteran's report at the VA examination carried more weight in his determination of whether the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD were met.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran has PTSD or that any depressive or anxiety symptoms he does have are related to his military service.  The Board has considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, but finds that the record does not provide an approximate balance of negative and positive evidence on the merits.  Service connection is, therefore, denied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet.

See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5-6 (2009).  Given the holding in Clemons, the Board has recharacterized the issues to the broader issue of entitlement of service connection for a psychiatric disability, as is reflected on the cover page.\r\n\r\nIn an August 2013 decision, the Board remanded the claim for further development.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the Veteran's file has been processed using the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS).  Additionally, a review of the Veteran's Virtual VA file reveals the April 2013 Board hearing transcript.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn the August 2013 decision, the Board requested that the examiner specifically comment on the multiple psychiatric diagnoses the Veteran has received.  While the examiner noted and commented on the Veteran's diagnoses of PTSD, alcohol dependence; unspecified drug dependence; anxiety; and tobacco use disorder; the examiner failed to address the Veteran's diagnosis of depression as seen in VA treatment records dated November 2011, December 2011 and May 2012.  While depression was not diagnosed at the time of the October 2013 VA examination, it has been diagnosed during the pendency of this appeal.  See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007) (instructing that the current disability requirement is satisfied when the claimant has a disability at the time the claim is filed or during the pendency of the appeal, even if the disability may have resolved prior to adjudication).  As such, a remand is necessary to obtain an addendum opinion regarding the Veteran's diagnosed depression.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1. The Veteran's claims file and a copy of this remand should be returned to the examiner that performed the October 2013 VA examination for an addendum opinion.  If the requested VA examiner is no longer available, another examiner should be asked to review the claims file and answer the questions posed below, or if this examiner determines that another examination would be helpful, the Veteran should be scheduled for a new examination.\r\n\r\nThe examiner should specifically comment on the Veteran's diagnosis of depression as seen in VA treatment records dated November 2011, December 2011 and May 2012 and comment as to whether the Veteran currently meets the DSM-IV criteria for such a diagnosis and if it is at least as likely as not that it developed due to service.  If it is determined that the Veteran does not presently meet the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of depression, the examiner should opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the previous diagnoses manifested due to service.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner is requested to provide a thorough rationale for any opinion provided.  An examiner's report that he or she cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation is inadequate unless the examiner provides a rationale for that statement. \r\n\r\n2. After completing the above, and any other development as may be indicated by any response received as a consequence of the actions taken in the preceding paragraphs, the Veteran's claim should be readjudicated based on the entirety of the evidence.  If the claim remains denied, the Veteran and his or her representative should be issued a supplemental statement of the case.  An appropriate period of time should be allowed for response.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.

Gang, Attorney\r\n\r\n\r\nWITNESS AT HEARING ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nVeteran\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nJ. W. Kim, Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from May 1967 to August 1968.\r\n\r\nThis appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2005 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Oakland, California.\r\n\r\nIn June 2012, the Veteran testified before the Board via videoconference.  In an August 2012 decision, the Board denied service connection for a psychiatric disability.  The Veteran appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.  Pursuant to a Joint Motion for Remand, in a November 2013 Order, the Court remanded the matter for readjudication in accordance with the joint motion.  In August 2014, the Veteran submitted additional evidence with a waiver of RO review.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nPursuant to the joint motion, the Board finds that further development is needed.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran claims he has PTSD as a result of an assault in service.  Specifically, he reports that while lathering his hair in the shower in June 1967, the water became scalding hot and he quickly stepped back and cleared the soap out of his eyes and saw another recruit named laughing at him.  He also indicated that he witnessed physical assaults on other recruits during basic training. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service medical records show that in June 1968 he was treated for angioneurotic edema and recurrent urticaria and prescribed Atarax for nervous problems.  His August 1968 discharge examination shows a normal psychiatric evaluation.  \r\n\r\nAt an August 2005 VA examination, the Veteran reported that his in-service stressor was an incident in which he was attacked in the shower.  He stated that someone turned off the cold water and scalded him.  He indicated that he reacted fast and pulled himself out of the shower and saw another recruit, who he named.  He noted that he did not report the incident and later developed rashes and edema and was tearful, with poor sleep, due to the incident.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD with secondary major depression and secondary cannabis dependence.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD with secondary depression was most likely related to a traumatic event the Veteran experienced while on active duty. \r\n\r\nAt a hearing before a DRO in August 2006, the Veteran testified that while he was in the shower another recruit turned off the cold water, scalding him, and he became very fearful from that point on.\r\n\r\nA March 2007 letter from the Vet Center shows that the Veteran's overall military experience may have led to depression. \r\n\r\nIn March 2011, a VA physician noted the Veteran's report that he had PTSD based on an attack in the shower in service.  The physician noted that the attack was not sexual in nature, but rather the Veteran was scalded by hot water, but did not sustain any burns.  The physician stated it was not clear how the Veteran was harmed by the incident in the shower.  The physician diagnosed the Veteran with depressive disorder, not otherwise specified, and concluded that the Veteran did not meet criterion A for PTSD.\r\n\r\nAt a June 2012 hearing before the Board, the Veteran indicated that while in service he was attacked in the shower when the cold water was turned off and saw a fellow recruit watching him.  He also indicated that he witnessed a company commander physically assault fellow recruits although he was not the victim of the assaults.  He testified that he internalized the attacks and the stress manifested itself as rashes and hives on his body.\r\n\r\nIn an August 2014 report, a private physician reviewed pertinent evidence in the Veteran's claims file and opined that the in-service stressor involving the assault in the shower was sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran had PTSD due to that in-service stressor.  In rendering the opinion, the physician noted the theory of the \"eggshell plaintiff\" and stated that the Veteran was an individual who is highly hypersensitive and can develop PTSD due to a relatively minor stressor.\r\n\r\nWhile the March 2011 VA physician opined that the stressor involving the assault in the shower was not sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD, that opinion appears to be based on the fact that the Veteran was not physically harmed by the stressor.  The Board observes that actual harm is not needed to be a sufficient PTSD stressor.  The physician also did not discuss whether seeing the physical assaults on other recruits was a sufficient stressor.  While the August 2014 private physician opined that the stressor involving the assault in the shower was sufficient and the Veteran has PTSD due to that stressor, that opinion is based on the finding that the Veteran was hypersensitive to stressors.  Without having examined the Veteran, the Board observes that that finding and the resulting opinion are of limited probative value.  Thus, the Veteran should be provided another VA examination to determine whether he has a psychiatric disability that had its onset in or is due to active service.\r\n\r\nPrior to the examination, the AOJ should obtain any outstanding medical records.  The record contains VA treatment notes through August 2011.  Thus, any treatment notes since that time should be obtained.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  Obtain any VA treatment records since August 2011.\r\n\r\n2.  Then, schedule the Veteran for a VA psychiatric examination to determine the nature and etiology of any psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and depression.  The examiner should review the claims folder and note that review in the report.  All indicated tests and studies should be performed.  The examiner should provide a full multi-axial diagnosis pursuant to DSM-IV and specifically state whether each criterion for a diagnosis of PTSD is met, to include discussion of the sufficiency of the stressors involving the assault in the shower and seeing the physical assaults of other recruits.  If the examiner finds that criterion A for a diagnosis of PTSD is met, the examiner should explain specifically how the Veteran's described experiences during service meet the criterion that he \"experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others.\"  The examiner should also specifically discuss whether it is credible that the Veteran's response to the claimed incidents involved \"intense fear, helplessness, or horror.\"  For each diagnosed psychiatric disorder, the examiner should opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent or greater probability) that the disorder had its onset in or is related to active service.  The examiner should address the June 1968 service medical record showing that the Veteran was treated for angioneurotic edema and recurrent urticaria and prescribed Atarax for nervous problems, the August 2005 VA examiner's opinion that the Veteran's PTSD with secondary depression was related to a traumatic event during active duty, the March 2007 Vet Center opinion that the Veteran's overall military experience may have led to depression, the March 2011 VA physician's conclusion that the Veteran did not meet criterion A for PTSD, and the August 2014 private physician's opinion that the stressor involving the assault in the shower was sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD and the Veteran has PTSD due to that stressor.  A rationale for all opinions should be provided.  \r\n\r\n3.  Then, readjudicate the claim, with consideration of all evidence added to the claims file since the issuance of the October 2011 supplemental statement of the case.  If any decision is adverse to the Veteran, issue a supplemental statement of the case and allow the appropriate time for response.  Then, return the case to the Board.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.

Jackson, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from March 1960 to September 1963.\r\n\r\nThis case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2006 rating decision issued by the RO. In June 2009, the Veteran testified before the Board at a hearing held at the RO; a transcript of the hearing is of record. The Board remanded the claim on appeal in January 2010 for further development of the record. Thereafter, in January 2012, the Board, in pertinent part, denied the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claim (Court). In March 2014, the Court issued a Memorandum Decision vacating the Board's January 2012 decision and remanded the issue back to the Board for additional adjudication.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the Veteran if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn the March 2014 Memorandum Decision, the Court found that the Board (1) failed to provide adequate reasons or bases for its decision by not discussing whether VA substantially complied with the Board's January 2010 remand order; (2) clearly erred in any implicit determination that the remand order was complied with; and, (3) clearly erred in finding that VA satisfied its duty to assist the appellant.\r\n\r\nIn the January 2010 remand, the Board, in pertinent part, instructed the RO to contact the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) and request that it determine if there are any classified service medical and personnel records for the Veteran, specifically concerning the events purportedly surrounding his capture in February 1962 and March 1962 and duty in a \"black ops\" unit. If the records existed, the RO was instructed to request that these records be released to VA.  If such records were not in the possession of the NPRC, they were to identify what government agency would keep such records. If the records did not exist, the RO was to include in the claims file a formal determination as to that fact and notify the Veteran accordingly. If classified records existed but could not be released to VA, the appellant was to be so informed.   \r\n\r\nThe Court determined that in the January 2012 decision, the Board erred in failing to ensure substantial compliance with its January 2010 remand order. Particularly, the Court observed that the RO only sought the appellant's personnel records from the NPRC, despite the Board's clear direction that they request that the NPRC determine whether there are any classified service medical and personnel records, particularly any which concern the claimed stressor events in February and March 1962. See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998) (holding that a Court or Board remand confers upon the appellant the right to compliance with that order); D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97, 105 (2008) (holding that there must be substantial compliance with the terms of a Court or Board remand).\r\n\r\nIn light of the Memorandum Decision, the Board finds that remand is warranted so that the RO may attempt to obtain additional service personnel records that reflect the Veteran's purported service in Vietnam and Laos. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1. Contact the NPRC and specifically request that it determine if there are any classified service medical and personnel records for the Veteran, primarily as it relates to events surrounding his purported duty in a \"black ops\" unit in Laos and North Vietnam in 1962 and his purported capture (and 6 day detainment) by a small group of North Vietnamese in February 1962 and March 1962.  If such records exist, request that these records be released to VA. If such records are not in the possession of the NPRC, request that they identify what government agency would keep such records.  \r\n\r\nA formal determination, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(2), must be entered if it is determined that the above records do not exist or that efforts to obtain them would be futile.  If classified records exist but due to their classification cannot be released to VA, this information should be provided to the Veteran.  In the event that it is determined that the records are unavailable, provide the Veteran with appropriate notice under 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c), and give him an opportunity to respond.\r\n\r\n2. After completing all indicated development, the RO should readjudicate the Veteran's claim on appeal in light of all the evidence of record. If any benefit sought on appeal remains denied, the Veteran and his representative should be furnished with a fully responsive Supplemental Statement of the Case.\r\n\r\nThereafter, if indicated, the case should be returned to the Board for the purpose of appellate disposition.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.

Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (scope of mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and other information of record).  Therefore, the claim of service connection for PTSD, has been recharacterized as service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran and his spouse testified in August 2013 before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge at a Travel Board hearing at the above VARO; a transcript is of record.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD, has been linked to in-service willful misconduct.  \r\n\r\n2.  A psychiatric disability other than PTSD, was not shown in service, or for years thereafter, and has not been linked to in-service disease or injury.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, was not incurred in or aggravated by his military service. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.1, 3.102, 3.301, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2014).\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.

Such notice must advise that a disability rating and an effective date for the award of benefits will be assigned if there is a favorable disposition of the claim.  Id.; 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.159, 3.326 (2012); see also Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 120-21 (2004) (Pelegrini II). \r\n\r\nPrior to initial adjudication of the Veteran's claim, a letter dated in September 2010 fully satisfied the duty to notify provisions of VCAA.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103; 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183, 187 (2002).  Additional notice was provided in June 2011.\r\n\r\nNext, VA has a duty to assist a Veteran in the development of the claim.  This duty includes assisting him in the procurement of service treatment records and other pertinent records, and providing an examination when necessary.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159 (2014).  The Board finds that all necessary development has been accomplished, and therefore appellate review may proceed without prejudice to the appellant.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384 (1993).  The claims file contains service treatment records (STRs), service personnel records, VA treatment records, and private treatment records.  \r\n\r\nThe RO did not afford the Veteran a VA examination on the basis that there is already sufficient medical evidence to decide the claim, and the Board agrees.  In McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006), the Court reviewed the criteria for determining when an examination is required by applicable regulation and how the Board applies 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c).  The three salient benchmarks are: competent evidence of a current disability or recurrent symptoms; establishment of an in-service event, injury, or disease; and indication that the current disability may be associated with an in-service event.  While the Veteran had been diagnosed with acquired psychiatric disabilities, there is no indication that they are associated with an in-service event that was not willful misconduct, as discussed below in detail.  Therefore, the Board finds that the evidence of record does not trigger the necessity of an examination in order to decide the claim on the merits.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has been afforded a hearing before a VLJ in which he presented oral argument in support of his claim.  In Bryant v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 488 (2010), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that 38 C.F.R. � 3.103(c)(2) (2010) requires that the VLJ who chairs a hearing fulfill two duties to comply with the above the regulation.  These duties consist of (1) the duty to fully explain the issues and (2) the duty to suggest the submission of evidence that may have been overlooked.  \r\n\r\nHere, during the hearing, the Veteran, through his testimony, demonstrated that he had actual knowledge of the elements necessary to substantiate his claim and the VLJ sought to identify any pertinent evidence not currently associated with the claims folder that might have been overlooked or was outstanding that might substantiate the claim.  Neither the Veteran nor his representative has asserted that VA failed to comply with 38 C.F.R. � 3.103(c)(2) nor has identified any prejudice in the conduct of the Board hearing.  By contrast, the hearing focused on the elements necessary to substantiate the claim.  As such, the Board finds that the duties set forth in 38 C.F.R. � 3.103(c)(2) were satisfied and that the Board can adjudicate the claim based on the current record.  \r\n\r\nII.  Service Connection\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated in active military service.  This means that the facts establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).  \r\n\r\nEstablishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed.Cir.2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F. 3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table).  \r\n\r\nService connection will also be presumed for certain chronic diseases, including psychoses, if manifest to a compensable degree within one year after discharge from service.  See 38 C.F.R. �� 3.307, 3.309 (2014).\r\n\r\nGenerally, VA law and regulations preclude granting service connection for a disability that is due to the veteran's own willful misconduct.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 105 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.1(m), 3.301(b) (2014). \r\n\r\nEstablishing service connection specifically for PTSD requires that there be (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a); (2) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; (3) and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f); see also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 138 (1997).  The diagnosis of a mental disorder must conform to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed. 2013) (DSM-V) and be supported by the findings of a medical examiner.  See 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a)  (2014).\r\n\r\nTo establish service connection for PTSD, the evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a recognizable stressor during service to support a diagnosis of PTSD will vary depending upon whether or not the Veteran engaged in \"combat with the enemy.\"  If the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, then, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d); see also 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West 2002); VAOPGCPREC 12-99.  Corroborating evidence is not needed if the claimed in-service stressor is related to the Veteran's \"fear of \r\nhostile military or terrorist activity.\"  The regulations require that: (1) A VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or contract equivalent, must confirm that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD; (2) the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service; and (3) the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nIf the veteran did not serve in combat, or if the claimed stressor is not related to combat, there must be independent evidence to corroborate a veteran's statement as to the occurrence of the claimed stressor.  See Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, 288-89 (1994).  The Veteran's testimony alone cannot establish the occurrence of a non-combat stressor that is not due to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.  See Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 166 (1996); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f). \r\n\r\nThe various diagnoses for the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder have included depression, anxiety disorder, and PTSD.  The Veteran specifically claimed service connection for PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe STRs do not show any complaints considered by medical personnel as  related to an acquired psychiatric disability.  When discharged from service in 1975, the Veteran denied ever experiencing depression or excessive worry, nervous trouble of any sort, or any illness other than those he already identified.  When examined for discharge the medical evaluation noted there were no psychiatric abnormalities.  \r\n\r\nPrivate treatment records beginning 2005 indicate the presence of depression and anxiety, but do not give an opinion on etiology or discuss any incident from service.\r\n\r\nAt October 2009 VA treatment the Veteran reported he had nightmares and flashbacks from an event that occurred in Thailand.  He reported that when he was buying illegal drugs a person attempted to rob him at knife point.  In the subsequent fight with the attacker, he snatched the knife and stabbed the attacker to death.  He  was diagnosed to have THC dependence, opiate dependence, heroin dependence, rule out PTSD, and depression, NOS.  February 2010 VA treatment records indicate that since the Veteran had been sober, anxiety and depression had become prominent.  He also reported symptoms of PTSD from killing a man in Thailand. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran wrote in an October 2010 statement that in December 1973 he was in Thailand when he was jumped by a man carrying a knife.  In the ensuing struggle the other man was stabbed.  The Veteran reported the person was bleeding heavily and while the Veteran was thinking about what to do, the person died.  Then, the Veteran, in a state of panic, cut the body open, put rocks inside it, and pushed it into a river.  Since then he had had nightmares and hallucinations.  The Veteran related that he coped over the next 37 years by self-medicating with illegal drugs.   Notably, the Veteran omitted the detail reported to his treatment provider that this occurred while he was buying illegal drugs and that the Veteran affirmatively snatched the attacker's knife and stabbed the person in an ensuing struggle.   \r\n\r\nSubsequent VA treatment records and letters from VA treating providers do not indicate any stressors related to service besides the 1973 incident in Thailand discussed above.  July 2013 statements from the Veteran's mother and sister indicate that the Veteran was sad, angry and withdrawn when he came home on leave during military service.  The Veteran's mother reported that in December 1980, while receiving VA inpatient treatment, the Veteran told her about what happened in Thailand, (although her statement leaves some doubt as to whether this is a reference to the killing the Veteran admitted to, as she also reports his horror of loading \"body bags of fallen soldiers\").  The Veteran's sister also reported the Veteran told her about \"the event in 1973\" in Thailand, although she too does not actually describe it.  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the December 1973 incident in which the Veteran killed a man was willful misconduct.  While the Veteran has consistently described the man who was killed as being the attacker, the incident happened when he was buying illegal drugs, and to cover up the events, he weighed down the body with rocks and disposed of it in a river.  Since there was willful misconduct on the part of the Veteran, this incident cannot be a stressor for the award of service connection.  See 38 C.F.R. �� 3.1(m), 3.301.  The Veteran has not reported any other incident from service that is a stressor for PTSD.    \r\n\r\nAlthough a nexus has been made between PTSD and the December 1973 in-service incident, service connection for PTSD must be denied because compensation may not be paid for diseases or disabilities that are due to willful misconduct.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.1(m). \r\n\r\nIn regards to an acquired psychiatric disability other than PTSD, the Board notes again that the STRs do not show any complaints, treatment or diagnosis related to a psychiatric disability.  The STRs indicate that when the Veteran was interviewed in November 1972 following an incident in which he drove while under the influence, the impression was potential alcoholism, and there were no complaints related to an acquired psychiatric disability.  On a December 1975 medical history report the Veteran indicated that he had never had depression or excessive worry, loss of memory or amnesia, or nervous trouble of any sort.  At the December 1975 separation examination the examiner noted that the Veteran was normal from a psychiatric standpoint.  The record also does not show that the Veteran had psychoses within a year of active service.  He was not diagnosed with an acquired psychiatric disability until several years after service.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Veteran is competent to report on his own symptomatology, to the extent that he is claiming he has had symptoms since service related to an acquired psychiatric disability, the Board does not find him to be credible.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  The STRs, including the Veteran's own December 1975 medical history report, which do not show symptomatology during service, are of more probative value than his current reports because they were contemporaneous to his active service.  The Board also notes that the VA treatment records do not show that the Veteran has always been truthful when describing his symptoms.  In March 2011, a VA treating provider felt that the Veteran was likely malingering for financial gain.  The Veteran did not appear psychotic, had not displayed behavior suggestive of psychosis, and his behavior was not consistent with psychosis.  His description of symptoms was not consistent with hallucinations and the Veteran did not have delusions or paranoia.  Testing was consistent with frequent exaggeration of symptoms, and the Veteran's stated goal at treatment was hospitalization to obtain help in appealing his compensation claim.  \r\n\r\nTo the extent that the Veteran and his family, through their statements and hearing testimony, are claiming that he has an acquired psychiatric disability due to an incident related to service that was not willful misconduct, they are not competent to make such a determination.  Their statements on etiology are therefore not afforded probative value.  See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77; citing Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir.2006)) (though the Federal Circuit held that lay evidence may be competent to establish a diagnosis of a condition, it did not state that lay evidence may be used to determine medical etiology).  The treatment records, including the January 2011 and July 2013 statements from treating providers, do not indicate that an acquired psychiatric disorder is due to any event, disease or injury from military service that was not willful misconduct.  \r\n\r\nBecause the evidence preponderates against the claim of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is inapplicable, and the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nMICHAEL E.

Davitian, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from November 1968 to June 1971, and from September 1984 to February 2005.  \r\n\r\nThis case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) on appeal from a March 2010 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Louis, Missouri, which denied the benefit sought on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe evidence does not show that the Veteran engaged in combat or experienced a stressor during active duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2012); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304 (2014).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nNotice and Assistance\r\n\r\nVA has duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326(a).  See also Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002); Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).  Notice was provided in a September 2008 letter.  Accordingly, the duty to notify has been fulfilled. \r\n\r\nWith regard to the duty to assist, the claim's file contains the Veteran's available service treatment records, service personnel records, VA and private medical records, and the transcript of a September 2013 hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge.  The Board has carefully reviewed the record and concludes that there has been no identification of further available evidence not already of record.  \r\n\r\nService treatment records from November 1968 to June 1971 are unavailable.  An October 2009 VA memorandum states that VA had determined that these service medical records were unavailable, all procedures to obtain them had been correctly followed, all efforts to obtain them had been exhausted, further efforts were futile, and, based on these facts, the records were unavailable.  The memorandum lists the attempts made to obtain the records.  The Board is aware that in such situations, it has a heightened obligation to explain its findings and conclusions and carefully consider the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  Cuevas v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 542, 548 (1992); O'Hare v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 365, 367 (1991).\r\n\r\nA VA examination was conducted in March 2012.  To that end, when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).  The Board finds that the March 2012 VA examination report is more than adequate in that it reflects a review of the Veteran's claims file, considers all of the pertinent evidence of record and provides a rationale for the opinion offered.  Parenthetically, the Board notes that, as discussed below, the opinion provided does not support the Veteran's claim as a stressor has not been established.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that all relevant facts have been properly and sufficiently developed in this appeal and no further development is required to comply with the duty to assist the Veteran in developing the facts pertinent to his claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he incurred PTSD during active duty.  During the hearing and the VA examination, he reported two stressors during active duty.  One occurred while he was with HQ Advisory Group 75th, U.S. Military Assistance Command (MACV), when a jeep in a convoy he was in was hit by a mortar.  The jeep driver was killed.  The Veteran was told that his name was Alfredo Gonzalez, and the Veteran was ordered to clean up the deceased's body parts.  The second stressor occurred when the Veteran was traveling by motorcycle in Thailand.  A friend named Jones, who was also riding a motorcycle, was decapitated as he drove with the Veteran.  In August 2008 correspondence and his claim for benefits, the Veteran stated that while with the MACV Advisory Team in Vietnam he engaged in firefights during which artillery was used. \r\n\r\nThe relevant law provides that service connection may generally be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).  In addition, service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d). \r\n\r\nIn particular, service connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV); (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor(s) occurred; and (3) medical evidence establishing a link between the current diagnosis and the stressor(s) in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nEffective July 13, 2010, VA amended its adjudication regulations governing service connection for PTSD by liberalizing, in certain circumstances, the evidentiary standard for establishing the required in-service stressor.  These amendments pertain to claimed stressors that are related to a veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.  \r\n\r\nIn each case where a veteran is seeking service connection for any disability, due consideration shall be given to the places, types, and circumstances of such veteran's service as shown by such veteran's service record, the official history of each organization in which such veteran served, such veteran's medical records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(a).\r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b).\r\n\r\nBased on a thorough review of the record, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD.  In so finding, the Board observes that there is no evidence that the Veteran was in combat or that he experienced a stressful event during service. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service personnel records and DD 214 fail to show that he was in combat.  Although the Veteran asserted that he was in combat, the Veteran has offered no specific details as to dates and locations.  He stated that he was with MACV at the time of the combat.  However, the Veteran's service personnel records fail to show that he was ever attached to MACV.  \r\n\r\nVA treatment records dated during the appeal period reflects a diagnosis of PTSD; combat related.  The March 2012 VA examination report provides an Axis I diagnosis of PTSD.  The report states that it is at least as likely as not that the PTSD diagnosis was related to the two stressors the Veteran reported concerning the convoy and motorcycles.  The report relates that the Veteran did not report any other stressors.  \r\n\r\nHowever, even when a claimant seeking service connection for PTSD has an unequivocal diagnosis of PTSD, service connection for PTSD requires a confirmed military service stressor, unless the claimed stressor is related to combat and the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn this case, as noted above, the Veteran's service personnel records and DD214 are negative for any evidence of combat.  Significantly, the Veteran has not provided any specific details in support of his contentions that he was in combat while attached to MACV.  In fact, as noted above, the Veteran's service personnel records fail to show that he was ever attached to MACV.  \r\n\r\nWhen a claimed stressor is not related to combat a veteran's lay testimony alone will not be enough to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.  Moreau, supra; Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 166 (1996).  The record must contain corroborative evidence that substantiates or verifies the Veteran's testimony or statements as to the occurrence of the claimed stressor.  West (Carlton) v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 70, 76 (1994); Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 (1993).\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence in this case to confirm any of the Veteran's alleged stressors.  The diagnoses of PTSD in the Veteran's VA treatment records and the March 2012 VA examination report do not corroborate that any stressor occurred.  The diagnoses are based solely on the Veteran's unsubstantiated assertions regarding what occurred in service.  A medical opinion premised upon an unsubstantiated account of a claimant is of no probative value.  Swann v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 229, 233 (1993) (generally observing that a medical opinion premised upon an unsubstantiated account is of no probative value, and does not serve to verify the occurrences described); Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (the Board is not bound to accept a physician's opinion when it is based exclusively on the recitations of a claimant).\r\n\r\nVA has attempted to corroborate the Veteran's claimed stressors.  A March 2010 VA memorandum in the claims file notes that the Veteran's service personnel records do not record that he was ever attached to HQ Advisory Group 75th (MACV).  The Vietnam Casualty List did not contain the name of Specialist Alfredo Gonzalez as being killed in Vietnam.  A March 2010 statement from the Joint Service Records Research Center reflected that examined records did not document that a person named Jones was killed, or was killed in an accident, in Thailand during the relevant period.  \r\n\r\nThe Board is not bound to accept the Veteran's uncorroborated account of his experiences.  Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1992); Swann, supra.  The question of whether a specific event reported by a veteran as a stressor actually occurred is a question of fact for the Board to decide, involving, as it does, factors as much historical as psychological.  Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614 (1992). \r\n\r\nIn the absence of a showing of combat with the enemy or evidence of a verifiable stressor, the Board concludes that the Veteran has failed to satisfy the criteria for service connection for PTSD.  As the Veteran bases his claim on the reported stressors, service connection cannot be granted without verification of them, regardless of the current diagnosis of PTSD or positive nexus opinion.\r\n\r\nIn sum, the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection for PTSD.  As the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.  See generally Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nMICHAEL MARTIN\r\nVeterans Law Judge, Board of Veterans' Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"5bec3ada8102470b4a1117e9","name":"1454469.txt","plainText":"Citation Nr: 1454469\t\r\nDecision Date: 12/10/14    Archive Date: 12/16/14\r\n\r\nDOCKET NO.  09-33 482\t)\tDATE\r\n\t)\r\n\t)\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Indianapolis, Indiana\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as due to in-service herbicide exposure and as secondary to service-connected diabetes mellitus and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nAppellant represented by:\tDisabled American Veterans\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nD. M. Donahue Boushehri, Counsel \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from June 1967 to June 1969.  He was awarded the Purple Heart and the Combat Infantryman Badge.\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2008 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Louis, Missouri.\r\n\r\nIn a February 2013 decision, the Board, in pertinent part, denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as secondary to herbicide exposure or diabetes mellitus.  The appellant subsequently filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In November 2013, while the case was pending at the Court, the VA Office of General Counsel and the appellant's attorney filed a Joint Motion for Partial Remand, requesting that the Court vacate the portion of the Board's February 2013 decision that pertained to the denial of service connection for hypertension.  (The Veteran withdrew his appeal with respect to the issue of entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy of the upper extremities, which had also been denied in the Board's February 2013 decision.)  In a December 2013 Order, the Court granted the Joint Motion, vacating the Board's February 2013 decision as it pertained to the denial of service connection for hypertension, to include as secondary to herbicide exposure or diabetes mellitus, and remanding the claim to the Board for compliance with directives that were specified by the Joint Motion.  The claim was remanded by the Board in June 2014 for an additional VA examination. \r\n\r\nIn his August 2009 substantive appeal, the Veteran requested a hearing before a Member of the Board at his local RO.  He withdrew this request in writing in April 2010.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nAs noted in the previous remand, the Board referred to the Joint Motion which noted that the Secretary has acknowledged that there is \"limited or suggestive evidence of an association between hypertension and exposure to herbicides.\"  Upon remand, the AOJ obtained a June 2014 VA opinion as to whether the Veteran's hypertension is due to herbicide exposure.  The examiner stated that \"First of all there is no correlation between agent orange and hypertension.\"  Given the acknowledgement by the Secretary that there is some evidence of an association, this opinion is inadequate as based on an inaccurate premise.  The Board finds another opinion is necessary which considers the evidence. \r\n\r\nIn addition, in a November 2014 appellate brief, the Veteran's representative argued that the Veteran's hypertension may be aggravated by his service-connected PTSD.  As no opinion has been obtained concerning his new theory of entitlement, the Board finds an additional opinion is necessary as to whether the Veteran's hypertension is caused or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD. \r\n\r\nFinally, it is unclear as to whether the Veteran's service treatment records are complete.  A request for any additional service treatment records should be made.  The Veteran should also be provided additional VCAA notice on remand, and any recent VA treatment records should be obtained.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Send the Veteran a VCAA notice letter addressing his claim for service connection for hypertension as secondary to service-connected diabetes mellitus and/or PTSD.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.310.\r\n\r\n2.  Obtain copies of any outstanding VA medical records and associate these copies with the claims folder.\r\n\r\n3.  Make arrangements to obtain a complete copy of the Veteran's service treatment records, to include all clinical records.\r\n\r\n4.  Thereafter, return the claims folder to the clinician who examined the Veteran in June 2014 for a supplemental opinion, as discussed below.  If the clinician who performed the June 2014 examination is not reasonably available, the opinion may be rendered by a different qualified medical professional.  The claims folders must be thoroughly reviewed by the examiner.\r\n\r\n(a)  The examiner should provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent probability or more) that the Veteran's hypertension had its clinical onset during active service or is related to any incident of service, to include exposure to herbicides.  \r\n\r\nIn providing this opinion, the examiner must specifically consider:\r\n\r\n(i)  Any additional service treatment records that may have been associated with the claims folder; and\r\n\r\n(ii) The fact that the National Academy of Science (\"NAS\") Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 2006, and later versions, have recognized that hypertension has been categorized as having \"limited or suggestive evidence\" of association with herbicide exposure.  See Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, Veterans and Agent Orange Update: 2006 (2007).\r\n\r\n(b)  If the examiner determines that the Veteran's hypertension is not related to his active service, he/she should provide opinions as to the following questions:\r\n\r\n(i)  Whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent probability or more) that the Veteran's hypertension was caused by his PTSD.\r\n\r\n(ii)  Whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent probability or more) that the Veteran's hypertension was aggravated by his PTSD.\r\n\r\nIf the examiner determines that an additional examination of the Veteran is required in order to provide the requested opinions, then the Veteran should be scheduled for an appropriate examination.  \r\n\r\nAny opinion expressed must be accompanied by a complete rationale.  \r\n\r\n5.  After the development requested above has been completed, again review the record.  If any benefit sought on appeal remains denied, the Veteran and his representative should be furnished a supplemental statement of the case and given the opportunity to respond thereto.  Thereafter, the case should be returned to the Board, if in order.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.

Adams, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from July 1970 to March 1972.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2009 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Louisville, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe RO certified the issue on appeal as entitlement to service connection for PTSD, to include depression, sleep disorder, and anxiety.  Because the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim and reported symptoms and all other information of record, the Board has re-characterized this claim more broadly to encompass all psychiatric disorders.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nAfter review of the claims file, the Board finds that additional development is necessary prior to adjudication of the Veteran's claim.\r\n\r\nIn July 2013 the VA was afforded a VA examination to ascertain the nature and etiology of his claimed acquired psychiatric disorder.  The examiner found that while the Veteran's reported stressor met the requirements for a DSM-IV PTSD stressor, he did not meet the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis.  Specifically, the Veteran did not report any symptoms of avoidance, re-experiencing, or hyperarousal.  The examiner noted that he had a history of mood disturbances but that these had been in remission for approximately two years.  Further, the examiner stated that there was no discernible nexus between the Veteran's mood disturbances and his in-service stressor.\r\n\r\nThe evidence also reflects that the Veteran has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder in the past.  Specifically, VA treatment records from February and April 2009 contain an Axis I diagnosis of bipolar disorder by history.  Additionally, a January 2009 report assessment and plan section indicates that the Veteran was to be treated for bipolar disorder and referred him to mental health services.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the proximity of the Veteran's treatment for bipolar disorder, coupled with the July 2013 examiner's notation that the Veteran continued to experience symptoms as recently as 2011, is evidence of a current psychological disorder.  In light of the Veteran's confirmed in-service stressor and current disorder, a medical opinion regarding the nexus of the Veteran's bipolar disorder is required.  While the 2013 examiner did opine that there was no discernible nexus between the Veteran's mood disturbances and his in-service stressor, this opinion is not supported by any rationale and is thus inadequate for VA purposes.  The opinion is also inadequate because it does not address whether the Veteran's bipolar disorder is related to any other aspect of his military service besides the specific stressors asserted in his PTSD claim.  As such, remand is necessary to obtain an opinion as to the etiology of the Veteran's bipolar disorder.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1. Request and obtain all VA treatment records for the Veteran from July 2009 to the present.  All attempts to obtain these records should be documented in the claims file.\r\n\r\n2. Thereafter, schedule the Veteran for an appropriate VA examination to assess the nature and etiology of his bipolar disorder.  The claims file, including a copy of this remand, should be reviewed by the examiner.  Any medically indicated tests should be conducted.  The examiner should provide accurate and fully descriptive assessments of all symptoms and make any indicated diagnoses.  After examination and review of all of the evidence, the examiner is asked to opine as to the following:\r\n\r\nWhether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent probability or greater) that any diagnosed psychiatric disorder, to include the Veteran's historically diagnosed bipolar disorder, began in service, was caused by service, or is otherwise related to his military service.\r\n\r\nA complete rationale for all opinions must be provided.\r\n\r\n3. Notify the Veteran that he must report for any scheduled examination and cooperate in the development of the claim.  Failure to report for a VA examination without good cause may result in denial of the claim.  38 C.F.R. �� 3.158, 3.655 (2014).\r\n\r\n4. When the above development has been completed, readjudicate the issue on appeal.  If any benefit sought on appeal remains denied, issue a Supplemental Statement of the Case to the Veteran and his representative.  After the Veteran and his representative have had an adequate opportunity to respond, return the appeal to the Board.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.

R. Stephens, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 20, 1986, to March 26, 1986. \r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) on appeal from an August 2007 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Des Moines, Iowa, which denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Veteran's request, she was scheduled for a videoconference hearing in April 2009.  However, the Veteran failed to appear for that hearing.  A postponement was not requested or granted.  The Veteran has not asserted any good cause for missing the hearing or requested that it be re-scheduled.  Under these circumstances, the regulations consider the hearing request to have been withdrawn. 38 C.F.R. � 20.704 (2014). \r\n\r\nThis matter was previously remanded by the Board in December 2011 and November 2013 for further development.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the Veteran's specific claim related to service connection for PTSD. During the pendency of this appeal, a Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) decision held that an appellant, who is a lay person, is not competent to diagnose his/her specific psychiatric disability.  Therefore, VA must consider whether the appellant's psychiatric symptoms regardless of the label attached to them warrant service connection.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  The evidence shows that the Veteran has been diagnosed with various psychiatric disorders, to include PTSD. Accordingly, the Board has recharacterized the issue as service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a remand is required in this case. Although the Board regrets the additional delay, it is necessary to ensure that there is a complete record upon which to decide the Veteran's claim.\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a February 2012 VA examination to diagnose and determine the etiology of any diagnosed mental disability.  During the examination, the Veteran reported that she had a hospital note documenting internal bleeding from forced intercourse.  A copy of this treatment note does not appear to be associated with the claims folder.  While the examiner advised the Veteran to submit this note to the AOJ, it does not appear that she has done so.  This note may have an impact on this appeal and the Veteran should be afforded another opportunity to submit the note. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Ask the Veteran to submit a copy of the hospital note discussing internal bleeding from forced intercourse referenced in the February 2012 examination report.  \r\n\r\n2.  If the Veteran is unable to locate the hospital note referenced in the February 2012 examination report, ask her to identify the facility that generated the note and the approximate date of treatment.  Thereafter, with any required assistance from the Veteran, please make appropriate efforts to obtain a copy of the note.\r\n\r\n3.  If the note referenced in the February 2012 examination report is located, schedule the Veteran for an examination to determine the nature and etiology of any current acquired psychiatric disability. The claims file, and a copy of this Remand must be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner in conjunction with the examination.  The examination report must indicate that the claims file was reviewed in conjunction with the examination.\r\n\r\na) Based on examination findings, historical records, and medical principles, the examiner must give a medical opinion, with full rationale, as to whether the Veteran currently has a diagnosis of PTSD, or any other psychiatric disability. \r\n\r\nb) If a diagnosis of PTSD is deemed appropriate, the examiner should opine whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., a 50 percent probability or greater) that any in-service stressful experience described by the Veteran occurred (personal or sexual assault).  In reaching this opinion the examiner should discuss whether the Veteran's in-service treatment for vaginitis (February 25, 1986) and \"honeymoon infection\" (March 17, 1986) are indicative of, or consistent with, a sexual assault.\r\n\r\nc) For any psychiatric disability or disabilities diagnosed, the examiner should opine whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., a 50 percent or greater probability) that the current disability was in whole or part the result of the claimed in-service personal assault or is otherwise attributable to service. \r\n\r\nOpinions should be provided based on the results of examination, a review of the medical evidence of record, and sound medical principles. The examiner must provide a rationale for the opinion provided and reconcile any opinion with any contradictory evidence of record.\r\n\r\nIf the examiner is unable to offer the requested opinion, it is essential that the examiner offer a rationale for the conclusion that an opinion could not be provided without resort to speculation, together with a statement as to whether there is additional evidence that could enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge. See Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382 (2010).\r\n\r\n2.  After undertaking any other development deemed appropriate, the RO will re-adjudicate the issues on appeal. If any benefit sought is not granted, the Veteran and his representative should be furnished with a supplemental statement of the case and afforded an opportunity to respond before the record is returned to the Board for further review.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Nelson, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant served on active duty from February 1984 to June 1984.\r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from February 2006 and January 2007 rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Los Angeles, California.\r\n\r\nIn July 2013 the appellant testified during a hearing at the RO before the undersigned.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nIn January 2015, VA was informed that the Veteran died in November 2014.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nDue to the death of the appellant, the Board has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of this appeal at this time.  38 U.S.C.A. � 7104(a) (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 20.1302 (2014); but see 38 U.S.C.A. � 5121A (West 2014); 79 Fed. Reg. 52,977 (Sept. 5, 2014) (to be codified at 38 C.F.R. pts. 3, 14, and 20). \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the appellant died during the pendency of the appeal.  As a matter of law, appellants' claims do not survive their deaths.  Zevalkink v. Brown, 102 F.3d 1236, 1243-44 (Fed. Cir. 1996); Smith v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 330, 333-34 (1997); Landicho v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 42, 47 (1994).  This appeal on the merits has become moot by virtue of the death of the appellant and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 7104(a) (West 2014); 79 Fed. Reg. 52,977, 52,984 (Sept. 5, 2014) (to be codified at 38 C.F.R. � 20.1302).\r\n\r\nIn reaching this determination, the Board intimates no opinion as to the merits of this appeal or to any derivative claim brought by a survivor of the Veteran.  79 Fed. Reg. 52,977, 52,984 (Sept. 5, 2014) (to be codified at 38 C.F.R. � 20.1106).  \r\n\r\nThe Board's dismissal of this appeal does not affect the right of an eligible person to file a request to be substituted as the appellant for purposes of processing the claim to completion.  Such request must be filed not later than one year after the date of the appellant's death.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5121A (West 2014); 79 Fed. Reg. 52,977, 52,982 (Sept. 5, 2014) (to be codified at 38 C.F.R. � 3.1010(b)).  A person eligible for substitution includes \"a living person who would be eligible to receive accrued benefits due to the claimant under section 5121(a) of this title ....\"  38 U.S.C.A. � 5121A (West 2014); see 79 Fed. Reg. 52,977, 52,982 (Sept. 5, 2014) (to be codified at 38 C.F.R. � 3.1010(a)).  An eligible party seeking substitution in an appeal that has been dismissed by the Board due to the death of the claimant should file a request for substitution with the VA office from which the claim originated (listed on the first page of this decision).  79 Fed.

Gielow, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had honorable active service from August 1980 to August 1984 and from April 1985 to September 1985.  A subsequent enlistment from September 1985 to August 1990 resulted in an other-than-honorable character of discharge, but a July 1991 character of discharge determination-recently associated with the claims file on remand-found that, because the Veteran's actions did not constitute willful and persistent misconduct, this period of service \"is considered to be under honorable conditions for VA purposes.\"   \r\n\r\nThis appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) arose from an October 2002 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Los Angeles, California.\r\n\r\nThe Board has remanded this matter for additional development on six prior occasions, including in July 2005, October 2008, May 2010, August 2012, March 2013, and November 2013.  The three most recent remands were deemed necessary in order to obtain a character of discharge determination for the Veteran's last period of active duty service from September 1985 to August 1990.  As a copy of the July 1991 character of discharge determination has since been associated with the appellant's electronic claims file, the Board may proceed with an adjudication on the merits at this time.  \r\n\r\nDespite the fact that the Veteran was never provided with another Supplemental Statement of the Case following the Board's last three remands in August 2012, March 2013, and November 2013, which specifically directed for the AOJ to readjudicate the appellate issue in a Statement of the Case if the benefit sought was not granted in full, in violation Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998), there is no prejudice to the Veteran in this case given the favorable nature of the Board's decision herein.   Nor is there any prejudice to the Veteran despite the fact that VA obtained additional VA treatment records after the issuance of the most recent Supplemental Statement of the Case in June 2012.  See records downloaded to Virtual VA in February 2015 (VA treatment records relating to, in part, the Veteran's psychological treatment); 38 C.F.R. � 20.1304(c) (creating an exception for referring pertinent evidence to the AOJ when \"the Board determines that the benefit or benefits to which the evidence relates may be fully allowed on appeal without such referral\").   \r\n\r\nAs a final introductory matter, the Board notes that the issue of whether new and material evidence has been submitted to reopen the claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD has been raised by the record.  See September 2014 representative argument (\"Please consider this brief in support of [the Veteran's] service connected compensation for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD.\" (Emphasis added).  However, this issue (the Board notes that service connection for PTSD was last denied in an October 2008 Board decision that bifurcated and remanded the issue of whether new and material evidence had been received to reopen the claim for service connection for a psychiatric disorder other than PTSD) has not yet been adjudicated by the AOJ.  Therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction over it, and it is referred to the AOJ for appropriate action.  38 C.F.R. � 19.9(b) (2014).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nResolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD-variously diagnosed as bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety-was incurred during active duty service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1112, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (2014).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(CONTINUED ON THE NEXT PAGE)\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  VA's Duties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nTo the extent that there may be any deficiency of notice or assistance, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding with adjudication of the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD or the merits.  Given the favorable nature of the Board's decision herein, any error in notice or assistance is harmless.\r\n\r\nII.  Service Connection for an Acquired Psychiatric Disorder other than PTSD\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD have been met.\r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, the evidence establishes a current disability during the appeal period.  See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007) (the requirement of a \"current disability\" is satisfied if a disorder is diagnosed at the time a claim is filed or at any time during the pendency of the appeal).  The Board first notes that this case has been pending on appeal for a long time, throughout which the Veteran has consistently sought psychiatric treatment.  A review of the record reflects that the Veteran filed his claim to reopen service connection for a psychiatric disorder in April 2002, and since that time, VA treatment records initially discussed several diagnoses, including a history of bipolar I versus bipolar II disorder, mood disorder not otherwise specified, bipolar disorder, and rule out bipolar I disorder.  See October 2002, December 2002, and January 2003 VA treatment records.  Subsequent VA treatment records seemed to consolidate his non-PTSD diagnoses, as it was noted that the Veteran was \"well d[iagnose]d with bipolar [disorder]\" in a September 2005 VA treatment record.  Recent treatment records downloaded to Virtual VA consistently determined that the Veteran has bipolar disorder, as well as depressive symptoms related to bipolar disorder, and was prescribed bipolar psychotropic medications.  See March 2014 through January 2015 VA treatment records.  According to a VA psychological examination in March 2011, the Veteran's diagnosis was bipolar disorder, mixed, and explained that \"this diagnosis is responsible for him having mood disturbance problems manifesting [with] both depressive and manic symptoms.\"  However, in October 2014, Veteran submitted a July 2014 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ), filled out by a private psychiatrist, which indicated that the Veteran met the criteria for both Axis I diagnoses of bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.  Even though the Veteran's symptoms have been variously diagnosed as bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression, the above evidence clearly demonstrates the existence of an acquired non-PTSD psychiatric disorder throughout the appeal period.\r\n\r\nThe crux of the matter hinges on whether the Veteran's psychiatric disorder, however it is definitively diagnosed, is related to service, including the psychiatric symptoms noted during his last period of active duty.  [As stated in the Introduction, according to a July 1991 character of discharge determination, this period of service is to be treated as under honorable conditions for VA purposes and thus is not a bar to VA benefits under 38 U.S.C.A. � 5303(e) (2014) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.12(f) (2014)].  As noted in the Board's previous remand, \"the evidence of record shows that the Veteran was treated for cocaine dependence and a failed suicide attempt during his final term of service, and he was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment within two years of his separation from the last period of active service.\"  Indeed, a review of service treatment records reflects that the Veteran's separation Report of Medical History reflected a history positive for depression or excessive worry and nervous trouble of any sort.  It was specifically noted that the Veteran received in-patient mental health treatment in January 1990 Tripler Army Hospital for depression. \r\n\r\nIn ascertaining whether any of his current symptoms are related to the symptoms first shown in service, the Board recognizes that there are differing opinions of record.  Notably, in a June 2012 addendum opinion to the March 2011 VA examination report, a VA examiner found \"NOTHING to suggest that any psychiatric disability was incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  His current diagnosis is NOT caused by, or a result of military service.\"  However, the VA examiner does not discuss the in-service symptoms and in-patient treatment for depression, nor does the VA examiner provide any further rationale for his negative nexus conclusion.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Veteran's specific diagnosis of bipolar disorder, the VA examiner further noted that there was nothing to indicate that it pre-existed active military service or that this condition was permanently aggravated by subsequent service.  The examiner explained that the onset did not occur during service; rather, the VA examiner stated that \"[h]e was first diagnosed having bipolar . . . since military service.\"  In this regard, to the extent that the Veteran's psychiatric history reflects that he suffered personal trauma from his childhood prior to service (see September 1992 letter from a private registered nurse), the Board notes that no psychiatric disability was noted upon his entrance and enrollment into active duty service.  Accordingly, the Veteran is entitled to the presumption of soundness.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 1111 (\"[E]very Veteran shall be taken to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service.\").  Moreover, the VA opinion above is evidence that affirmatively weighs against rebuttal of the presumption of soundness.  Here, there is simply no \"clear and unmistakable evidence\" that the condition, even though not noted upon entrance, preexisted service and was not aggravated thereby.  See, e.g. Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 240 (2012) (discussing the types of evidence that may constitute or contribute to clear and unmistakable evidence of lack of aggravation); Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Therefore, the operative question remains whether the Veteran is entitled to service connection on a direct basis.\r\n\r\nContrary to the negative VA addendum opinion, the Veteran submitted a July 2014 DBQ from his private psychologist that specifically determined that \"while depression and anxiety have existed for many years, period of time in Desert Storm [] greatly increased his deterioration.\"  Crucially, although not sufficient to rebut the presumption of soundness discussed above, this private opinion strongly denotes the causal effect of the Veteran's service on his current psychiatric disability, thereby providing a link between service and the Veteran's current non-PTSD diagnoses.  Furthermore, the Veteran also submitted a September 2014 statement from the Veteran's treating psychologist at VA, who determined that the Veteran's \"symptoms, significantly affecting his daily functioning, have reportedly been persistent since his time in the service.  . . . I can see from a review of his records that his symptoms have presenting ongoing difficulty for him since his service time.\"  This competent evidence strongly supports a finding of in-service incurrence.  Because both the private psychologist and the Veteran's treating psychologist take into account the lengthy history and plethora of psychiatric symptoms demonstrated in the record over the years, including those noted during service (unlike the negative VA opinion), the Board finds these positive opinions to be highly probative.  In fact, the Board can find no adequate basis to reject the positive evidence of record demonstrating that the Veteran's current psychiatric disorder continuously existed since his last period of service, based on a lack of credibility or probative value.  Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 22, 26 (1998).\r\n\r\nGiven the diagnoses rendered during the appeal period and the favorable nexus evidence of record which places the incurrence during service, the Board resolves doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that the evidence supports the establishment of service connection.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102.  As such, the Veteran's service-connection claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a psychiatric disorder other than PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nDEBORAH W.

Poulson, Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from August 1980 to August 1983.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2011 decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Columbia, South Carolina.  The issue has been recharacterized given the nature of the Veteran's claim and the medical evidence of record.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).\r\n \r\nIn October 2014, the Veteran and his wife testified at a video conference hearing before the undersigned Acting Veterans Law Judge.  A transcript of the hearing is associated with the claims file, which reflects that the Board would keep the record open for a period of 30 days for the submission of additional evidence.  See Hearing Transcript at 13.  No additional evidence has been received.\r\n\r\nThe AOJ issued a Statement of the Case (SOC) in May 2013.  Records from the Social Security Administration (SSA) were subsequently added to the claims file. There is no waiver for these records; however, this evidence is not relevant to the issue on appeal, as the Veteran sought SSA disability benefits for disabilities other than a psychiatric disability.  Thus, a remand for the issuance of a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) is not necessary. \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1. The evidence of record reflects that the Veteran does not have a current PTSD diagnosis.\r\n\r\n2.  An acquired psychiatric disability, to include depression and anxiety, did not have its clinical onset in service and is not otherwise related to active duty; a psychosis was not exhibited within the first post service year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nA psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety, was not incurred in or aggravated by the Veteran's active service, and a psychosis may not be presumed to have been incurred therein.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5103, 5013A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309 (2014).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nVA has a duty to provide notice to the Veteran with respect to establishing entitlement to benefits, and a duty to assist with development of evidence under 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5103, 5103A (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) (2014).  \r\n\r\nBy way of a July 2011 pre-adjudication letter, VA notified the Veteran of the information and evidence need to substantiate his service connection claim.  This letter requested specific information about the reported stressor.  This letter also notified the Veteran of the criteria for assigning a disability rating and an effective date.  See Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).  Accordingly, the Board finds that VA satisfied its duty to notify.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, the Board finds that VA has complied with its duty to assist the Veteran in the development of his claim.  The evidence of record includes service treatment records (STRs), service personnel records, VA treatment records, private treatment records, Social Security Administration (SSA) records, lay statements, and testimony.  Additionally, the RO contacted the U.S. Army and Joint Service Records Research Center (JSRRC) and the U.S. Army Crime Records Center in an attempt to corroborate the alleged in-service stressor.  Negative replies were received from both agencies.  The RO subsequently made a formal finding of lack of information to corroborate the alleged stressor.  The Veteran has been notified of these negative responses.  See May 2013 SOC.\r\n\r\nNo examination was conducted in connection with the Veteran's claim.  However, as explained herein, there is no competent evidence of PTSD and no evidence of psychological complaints during service.  Nor is there an indication that any currently diagnosed psychiatric disability is etiologically related to service.  Hence, a remand for an opinion is not necessary to decide this claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(4); see also Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2010).\r\n\r\nFinally, neither the Veteran nor his representative assert that VA failed to comply with 38 C.F.R. � 3.103(c)(2) or identified any prejudice in the conduct of the October 2014 hearing.  The Board thus finds that he is not prejudiced and the Board can adjudicate the claim.  See Bryant v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 488 (2010).\r\n \r\nII.  Analysis\r\n\r\nService connection means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated during service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304 (2014).\r\n\r\nIn order to prevail on the issue of service connection for any particular disability, there must be evidence of a current disability; evidence of in-service occurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and medical evidence, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence, of a nexus between an in-service injury or disease and the current disability.  See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); see also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that \"[w]hether lay evidence is competent and sufficient in a particular case is a factual issue to be addressed by the Board\").\r\n\r\nService connection for certain chronic diseases, such as psychosis, may also be established based upon a legal \"presumption\" by showing that it manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1112 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.307, 3.309 (2014).  The option of establishing service connection through a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology rather than through a finding of nexus is specifically limited to the chronic disabilities listed in 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(a).  See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (rejecting the argument that continuity of symptomatology in � 3.303(b) has any role other than to afford an alternative route to service connection for specific chronic diseases).  In addition, service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after service when all the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d) (2014).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence establishing a diagnosis of the disorder, credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor(s) actually occurred, and a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran, in written statements and testimony before the Board, attributes his current mental health problems to witnessing the aftermath of a motor vehicle accident during service.  Specifically, he claims that he saw the decapitated body of his friend.  The Veteran maintains that he developed permanent psychiatric trauma as a result of that in-service stressor.  \r\n\r\nA review of the Veteran's STRs fails to show any treatment for, or diagnosis of, any psychiatric complaints.  An April 1980 enlistment examination contains a normal psychiatric evaluation.  The Veteran reported that he had no history of depression, excessive worry, or nervous trouble of any sort.  He elected not to have a separation examination.  See August 1983 STR.\r\n\r\nPost-service private and VA medical records show that the Veteran suffered a stroke in July 2010.  Shortly thereafter, he began seeking ongoing outpatient treatment for mental health problems.  His symptoms have been alternately diagnosed as depression and anxiety.  \r\n\r\nAfter a careful review of the pertinent evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted for PTSD or any other acquired psychiatric disability.\r\nWith regard to the Veteran's claim that he has PTSD, at no time during the appeal period has PTSD been diagnosed.  The Board acknowledges a positive PTSD screen in November 2011.  However, the fact that the Veteran had a positive PTSD screen does not constitute evidence of a competent diagnosis of PTSD.  Notably, a July 2012 VA mental health record indicates that the Veteran asked for a PTSD test, explaining that \"he was told by a lawyer he would need a diagnosis of PTSD on his chart in order to receive [service connection] compensation.\"  Service connection cannot be granted in the absence of a current disability.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). \r\n\r\nThe Board also finds that the competent evidence does not show a relationship between the Veteran's service and his currently diagnosed depression and anxiety.  As an initial matter, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements with respect to the alleged stressor are not credible.  See Madden v. Gober, 123 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (the Board is entitled to discount the weight, credibility, and probity of evidence in light of its own inherent characteristics and its relationship to other items of evidence); see also Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) (VA cannot ignore a veteran's testimony simply because the veteran is an interested party; personal interest may, however, affect the credibility of the evidence).  He has provided inconsistent accounts regarding whether he actually witnessed the aftermath of the accident.  A September 2011 VA mental health record shows that the Veteran reported that a friend of his was killed (decapitated) in a motor vehicle accident.  The clinician wrote: \"He did not see this, but heard about it from friends.\"  Similarly, a July 2012 VA mental health note indicates that the Veteran reported the decapitation of his friend due to an accident during service.  The clinician wrote: \"In the past he has admitted he was not present when this happened, but heard about it from friends.\"  \r\n\r\nHowever, in a September 2012 stressor statement, the Veteran wrote: \"[I]t was raining and we told him not to go off post but he decided to go and lost control of the vehicle and had an accident. When we got to the scene, I saw him still in the seatbelt, blood still gushing from his neck, and his head was in the back window.\"  During the October 2014 hearing, the Veteran provided a similar description of the alleged stressor:\r\n\r\n[W]e had guard duty and it was raining.  And I told him, we had [sic] another friend told him, wait till -- wait till the next day before you go, because he was going downtown because he had a girl friend, and he never made it.  He hit a tree.  Cut his head off.  When we finally went to the scene of the accident, the whole head was severed from his neck.  His head was in the back windshield and he was still in the driver's seat.  I could see a lot of blood shooting out his neck.\r\n\r\nHearing Transcript at 6.  \r\n\r\nThe Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that \"everything started coming back again\" after his stroke in 2010.  See Hearing Transcript at 8.  The inconsistencies of the Veteran's statements are understandable given the memory impairment that resulted from his stroke, but they undermine his credibility nonetheless.  Therefore, the Board assigns no probative value to the Veteran's claim that he witnessed the decapitated body of his friend.\r\n\r\nThe evidence also does not show that the onset of any current psychiatric disorder occurred during service.  There is no indication of psychiatric treatment or intervention during the Veteran's active service or for the years immediately following service.  Indeed, the earliest showing of psychiatric complaints is in 2010, which is more than 25 years following service discharge.  The Court has indicated that normal medical findings at the time of separation from service, as well as the absence of any medical records of a diagnosis or treatment for many years after service is probative evidence against the claim.  See Maxson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 453, 459 (1999), aff'd sub nom. Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  Thus, the lack of any evidence of psychiatric complaints, symptoms, or findings until nearly three decades after service is itself evidence which tends to show that no psychiatric disorder had its onset during service.  Moreover, mental health professionals have attributed the currently diagnosed depression and anxiety to the Veteran's declining physical health.  See November 2010 VA Treatment Record (finding that some of the Veteran's psychiatric complaints were due to his stroke) and August 2011 Treatment Record (diagnosing depression and anxiety and finding that the Veteran was having difficulty coping with his physical problems).\r\n\r\nFinally, the competent evidence of record does not show that psychosis was diagnosed within one year of separation.  Thus, presumptive service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is not warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. �� 3.307, 3.309.\r\n\r\nThe Board is mindful that the Veteran asserts that he has experienced chronic psychiatric problems as a result of his service.  The Veteran and his wife are competent to testify as to the presence of post-service mental health symptoms, which are capable of lay observation.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, as a lay person, they have not been shown to have the clinical expertise to opine as to medical etiology or to render a medical opinion.  Accordingly, their assertions as to medical causation and etiology, absent corroboration by objective medical evidence and opinions, lack sufficient probative value to establish a nexus between his current psychiatric problems and his time in service.  See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005); see also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety, and the claim is denied.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b) (West 2014); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety, is denied. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nAlexandra P.

Keselyak, Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had five months of active service during the period from August 1971 to August 1972; 192 days were non-pay periods of time lost.\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of February 2007 and July 2008 rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Petersburg, Florida, and Atlanta, Georgia, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a Travel Board hearing in January 2014.  A transcript of the testimony offered at the hearing has been associated with the record.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nA remand by the Board confers on an appellant, as a matter of law, the right to compliance with the remand order.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).  If the Board proceeds with final disposition of an appeal, and the remand order has not been complied with, the Board errs in failing to ensure compliance.  Id. at 271. While the Board regrets additional delay in this case, the matter must be remanded for the reasons discussed below.\r\n\r\nWhen the matter was last before the Board, it was remanded to afford the Veteran a medical examination and obtain an opinion on the etiology of any psychiatric disability, to include PTSD.  The Veteran claims that he has psychiatric disability related to in-service assault, and VA specifically sought an opinion as to the likelihood of the occurrence of the claimed physical assault.\r\n\r\nIn July 2014, the Veteran was examined by a VA psychologist, who assessed cocaine use disorder, alcohol use disorder and unspecified depressive disorder.  The examiner concluded that the diagnoses - depression and substance abuse - were not due to or caused by the Veteran's military experience that took place over 40 years ago.  An addendum to the opinion  also dated in July 2014, notes the VA examiner's opinion that he could not \"give a medical opinion regarding specific events that took place in a person's life many, many years ago without resorting to mere speculation.\"  The examiner did not offer any rationale for either opinion, and after the examination and opinions were offered, relevant VA and service records were associated with the record.  \r\n\r\nOnce VA has provided a VA examination, it is required to provide an adequate one.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).  This generally means that a medical examination report must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007).  An examination is adequate if it \"takes into account the records of prior medical treatment, so that the evaluation of the claimed disability will be a fully informed one.\"  Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 311 (quoting Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 121, 124 (1991)).  An examination must be based upon consideration of the Veteran's prior medical history and examinations.  Stefl, 21 Vet. App. at 123.  The Secretary has an affirmative duty to gather the evidence necessary to render an informed decision on a claim.  Douglas v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 19 (2009). Because the examiner did not provide rationale for his conclusions and did not have the benefit of reviewing all relevant evidence, the examination report is inadequate and must be returned.  38 C.F.R. � 4.2.\r\n\r\nAlso, in its March 2014 remand, the Board directed the AOJ to provide notice to the Veteran in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(e) regarding the unavailability of any further service treatment and personnel records in the possession of a Federal agency.  In April and June 2014 letters, the AOJ generally asked the Veteran to provide any records, including service treatment records, in his possession in support of the claim.  The letters did not advise the Veteran that VA was unable to obtain additional service records.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran did indeed provide VA with some service treatment and personnel records related to the circumstances of his discharge; however, the Board's remand directives require that he be provided notice containing the following information:  \r\n\r\n(i) The identity of the records VA was unable to obtain;  \r\n\r\n(ii) An explanation of the efforts VA made to obtain the records; \r\n\r\n(iii) A description of any further action VA will take regarding the claim, including, but not limited to, notice that VA will decide the claim based on the evidence of record unless the claimant submits the records VA was unable to obtain; and\r\n\r\n(iv) A notice that the claimant is ultimately responsible for providing the evidence.  \r\n\r\nSee 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(e)(1) (2015).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Since additional service treatment and personnel records do not appear to have been requested since 2005, request any such records from the appropriate source(s).  If no additional records are obtained, provide the Veteran with notice in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(e) regarding the unavailability of any further service treatment and personnel records.  The notice must contain the following information:  \r\n\r\n(i) The identity of the records VA was unable to obtain; \r\n\r\n(ii) An explanation of the efforts VA made to obtain the records; \r\n\r\n(iii) A description of any further action VA will take regarding the claim, including, but not limited to, notice that VA will decide the claim based on the evidence of record unless the claimant submits the records VA was unable to obtain; and\r\n\r\n(iv) A notice that the claimant is ultimately responsible for providing the evidence.  \r\n\r\nSee 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(e)(1) (2015).\r\n\r\n2.  Refer the electronic claims folder to the examiner who performed the July 2014 examination (if available) to obtain an addendum opinion as to the etiology of the diagnosed psychiatric disabilities.  Specifically, the examiner is asked to address whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., whether there is at least a 50 percent probability) that the claimed in-service assault took place, and whether it is at least as likely as not that PTSD or any other psychiatric disability, is related to that assault.  The examiner should also offer an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not that any psychiatric disability is otherwise related to service.  The examiner's attention is directed to service records submitted by the Veteran in June 2015 concerning a psychiatric disorder and the Veteran's reports to VA clinicians that he was assaulted in service.  See, e.g., July 1999 and August 2013 VA treatment records.   \r\n\r\nIf the 2014 examiner finds that another examination is necessary or is unavailable to complete the addendum, the Veteran should be scheduled for a new examination.\r\n\r\nThe electronic claims folder must be made available to the examiner for review in conjunction with the examination.  A complete rationale for all opinions should be provided. If the examiner cannot reach a conclusion without resorting to speculation, he or she should explain why a response would be speculative.\r\n\r\n3.  Thereafter the issue on appeal should be readjudicated.  If any benefit sought on appeal is not granted to the Veteran's satisfaction, the Veteran and his representative should be provided with a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) and afforded the opportunity to respond thereto.  The matter should then be returned to the Board, if in order, for further appellate process.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West 2014).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nS. S.

Chisholm, Attorney at Law\r\n\r\n\r\nWITNESS AT HEARING ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nAppellant\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nM. Prem, Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from August 1970 to May 1974.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2006 rating decision by a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). \r\n\r\nIn May 2014, the Board found that new and material evidence was received to reopen the claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include PTSD.  It then denied the claim on a de novo basis.  In May 2015, pursuant to a Joint Motion for Remand, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) vacated the Board's decision.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran presented testimony at a Board hearing in May 2012. A transcript of the hearing is associated with the Veteran's claims folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's psychiatric disability was incurred during service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for an award of service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.6, 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2014).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nApplicable law provides that service connection will be granted if it is shown that the Veteran suffers from disability resulting from an injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty, in the active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303. That an injury occurred in service alone is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury. If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity. 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b). Additionally, for Veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities, such as psychoses, are presumed to have been incurred in service if manifest to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from service. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.307, 3.309. Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nThe service treatment records reflect that the Veteran was treated for anxiety in July 1972 at the Wiesbaden Hospital in Germany.  A neurological examination was normal.  The impression was \"(s)ome anxiety otherwise no organic neurological problem.\"  \r\n\r\nIn August 1972, the Veteran was admitted to the hospital with a three day history of abdominal discomfort, nausea, and diarrhea (claims file Volume 3).  He recovered from these symptoms after several days, but was transferred to the psychiatric ward following an episode of alcoholic ingestion and disruptive behavior.  He talked about using drugs and wanting to jump out a window.  He was observed as noisy and loud, until he was placed in a seclusion room.  Another treatment report (from the same time period) reflects that the Veteran was found in his room stripped to the waist.  He had an unsteady gait and was using foul language.  He talked about going to Vietnam and dying.  He was put to bed with the side rails up, but he continued to be uncooperative.  Hand and leg restraints were used.   He was assessed with an emotional instability reaction.  \r\n\r\nIn December 1972, the Veteran was involved a motor vehicle accident.  He sustained several injuries.  He appeared nervous and apprehensive.  His behavior was noted to be \"rather inappropriate\" concerning the death of his friend (in the same motor vehicle accident).  He was prescribed Valium for restlessness and apprehension.  \r\n\r\nThere are no further findings for the remainder of the Veteran's service, and his January 1974 separation examination was normal with respect to psychiatric disabilities.\r\n\r\nThe first post service medical evidence consists of a November 1996 correspondence from Dr. D.A. of the Fremont Medical Center.  It states that Dr. D.A. has been treating the Veteran for severe anxiety and depression for the past 3-4 years. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran underwent a VA examination in December 1996.  He stated that he was \"really depressed.\"  The examiner noted a history of Recurrent Major Depression.  The Veteran reported that he was working in a casino until his gaming room was shut down.  He has been unemployed since then.  He had recently lost his apartment, and he was in the middle of divorce proceedings.  He was diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder, type II.  Psychological stressors listed were: job, financial, and divorce issues.  There was no indication that his psychiatric symptoms were related to service. \r\n\r\nOutpatient treatment records reflect a suicide attempt in January 1997.  He was diagnosed with rule out schizoaffective disorder, alcohol dependency in remission. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran underwent another VA examination in December 1997.  The examiner noted that the Veteran was being evaluated for the first time for the purpose of establishing service connection for depression.  The Veteran reported that after finishing basic training, he was sent to a fuel center where he would work with gas. It made him sick and affected his skin.  He asked for a transfer for 18 months and was briefly sent to work in a hospital.  However, he was eventually sent back and \"at that point he snapped.\"  He began crying and woke up in restraints.  He was hospitalized for a week before being sent back to duty.  Shortly thereafter, he began hearing voices.  He was discharged in 1974 and went to school off and on before getting a B.A. degree in 1983.  He started receiving treatment for depression in 1990.  He lost custody and visitation rights to see his daughter because he could not pay child support.  He stated that he was homeless.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with schizoaffective disorder, chronic, moderate to severe.  He was unable to render an opinion about service connection because he did not have access to service treatment records to confirm the Veteran's reports of treatment for in-service symptoms. \r\n\r\nA June 1998 private treatment report from Dr. J.L.P. reflects that the Veteran continued to attribute his anxiety and depression to service (though he mentioned no specific in-service incident).  He reported suicide attempts in 1995 and 1996.  The examiner stated that the Veteran had a long-standing history of suicidal ideation, and he diagnosed the Veteran with Major Depression Single Episode with Psychotic Features.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran underwent a VA examination in March 2004.  The examiner reviewed the claims file in conjunction with the examination.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's schizoaffective disorder did not occur during service and was not caused or aggravated by service.  His opinion was based on the timeframe of various treatment records and some inconsistencies in the records.  For example, the fact that hallucinations are not mentioned in the treatment records until the mid-1990s despite earlier treatments, including as early as 1989.  He also noted two letters of work performance in 1973 that describe good work by the Veteran. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran underwent a VA examination in August 2005.  The examiner reviewed the claims file in conjunction with the examination.  Once again, the Veteran reported a history of hospitalizations in the 1970s while in Germany, as well as a hospitalization in Las Vegas in the 1990s (following a suicide attempt).  He reported that he had been having a hard time finding a job as a short order cook once prospective employers find out that he has hepatitis C.  After a thorough examination, the examiner found it less likely than not that the Veteran's schizoaffective disorder and panic disorder are related to his in-service emotional instability.  He further noted some inconsistencies and likely untrue statements.  He noted that the Veteran's report of being on lithium without routine laboratory testing is very unlikely to be true.  He also noted that during the examination, the Veteran stated that he took the bus.  However, when the examination was over, the Veteran walked slowly to the door.  When he got to the main door, his pace was normal. Then the Veteran got in a Cadillac and sped away.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's statements that he does not drive and that he is having significant financial difficulty were undermined by these events. \r\n\r\nAn April 2006 psychiatry note, written by Dr. E.P.A. reflects that the Veteran reported hearing voices and attempting suicide while in service.  She stated that the Veteran's military records were lost but it sounds like his symptoms started in the military.  She diagnosed schizoaffective disorder and stated that the Veteran's \"psychiatric symptoms clearly started in the military.\"   \r\n\r\n Dr. E.P.A. submitted an August 2008 correspondence in which she stated that she was the Veteran's care provider for the past six years.  She further stated that she believes that the Veteran's schizoaffective disorder began during military service. She stated that the Veteran served in the Air Force from 1972-1974 and that during this time, he began hearing voices 3-4 times per week.  The voices would tell him to harm himself, and the Veteran began to drink alcohol in order to quiet them.  He attempted suicide during service and was hospitalized in a psychiatry ward for one week. His symptoms were so severe that he had to be put in restraints.  She stated that although the Veteran was treated for alcohol abuse, these symptoms indicated more than an alcohol problem.  She stated that in 1974, the Veteran was prescribed Lithium by someone who may or may not have been a psychiatrist (the Veteran could not remember).  Dr. E.P.A. stated that the Veteran had been consistent in reporting these in-service symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn July 2015, the Veteran submitted a private medical opinion from Dr. R.I.F.  He reviewed the Veteran's claims file and diagnosed the Veteran with schizoaffective disorder - a psychotic disorder.  He opined that it was more likely than not, \"almost certain,\" that the Veteran manifested symptoms of schizophrenia-spectrum during service.  He further opined that the medical record strongly suggests that the Veteran was in a prodromal (beginning) state of schizophrenia during service, and that at least one in-service event could reasonably be expected to have exacerbated it.  The medical opinion was thorough, and the conclusion was supported by the Veteran's symptoms as noted in the service treatment records, as well as medical treatises.     \r\n\r\nVA examiners in March 2004 and August 2005 have offered opinions that weigh against the Veteran's claim, and Drs. E.P.A. and R.I.F. have rendered August 2008 and July 2015 opinions that weighs in favor of the claim. \r\n\r\nThe Court has held that the Board must determine how much weight is to be attached to each medical opinion of record.  See Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467 (1993).  Greater weight may be placed on one medical professional's opinion over another, depending on factors such as reasoning employed by the medical professionals and whether or not, and the extent to which, they reviewed prior clinical records and other evidence.  Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36 (1994). \r\n\r\nAdequate reasons and bases, in short, must be presented if the Board adopts one medical opinion over another.  In assessing evidence such as medical opinions, the failure of the physician to provide a basis for his opinion goes to the weight or credibility of the evidence in the adjudication of the merits.  See Hernandez-Toyens v. West, 11 Vet. App. 379, 382 (1998).  Other factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion are the physician's access to the claims file and the thoroughness and detail of the opinion.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. 444, 448-9 (2000).  In some cases, the physician's special qualifications or expertise in the relevant medical specialty or lack thereof may be a factor.  In every case, the Board must support its conclusion with an adequate statement of its reasoning of why it found one medical opinion more persuasive than the other.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise in this case.  Consequently, service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include PTSD is warranted. \r\n\r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nThere is no need to undertake any review of compliance with the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) and implementing regulations in this case since there is no detriment to the Veteran as a result of any VCAA deficiency in view of the fact that the full benefit sought by the Veteran is being granted by this decision of the Board.  See generally 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326(a) (2014).  The Board notes that an RO letter dated May 2005 informed the Veteran of the manner in which disability ratings and effective dates are assigned.  The RO will take such actions in the course of implementing this grant of service connection, and the Veteran may always file a timely notice of disagreement if he wishes to appeal from those downstream determinations.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nERIC S.

Costello, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from September 1980 to September 1983.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2011 rating decisions of the Department of the Veteran Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). \r\n\r\nIn September 2015, the Veteran testified regarding this matter at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge.  A transcript of the hearing has been associated with the claims file. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran initially filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  However, in Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims clarified how the Board should analyze claims for PTSD and other acquired psychiatric disabilities.  As emphasized in Clemons, the veteran's claim \"cannot be limited only to that diagnosis, but must rather be considered a claim for any mental disability that may be reasonably encompassed.\"  Id.  Upon review of the evidence, which shows diagnoses of PTSD related to military sexual trauma, and identity problems, the Board has re-characterized the issue as shown on the title page.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends she has PTSD, attributable to a military sexual assault that occurred during service.  Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nThe law provides that if a PTSD claim is based on an in-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than the veteran's service records may corroborate the veteran's account of the stressor incident.  Gallegos v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 329 (2008); see 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(5).  Examples of such evidence include, but are not limited to: records from law enforcement authorities, rape crises centers, mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy.  Evidence of behavioral changes following the claimed assault is one type of relevant evidence that may be found in these alternate sources.  Examples of behavioral changes that may constitute credible evidence of a stressor include, but are not limited to: request for transfer to another military duty assignment; deterioration in work performance; substance abuse; episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable cause; or unexplained economic or social behavioral changes.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(5).  In cases involving personal assault, the existence of a stressor in service does not have to be proven by the \"preponderance of the evidence\" because this would be inconsistent with the benefit of the doubt, or equipoise, doctrine contained in 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b).  YR v. West, 11 Vet. App. 393, 399 (1998); Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272, 279-280 (1999).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, under 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), VA can submit any evidence, including alternate source evidence, to a medical or mental health professional for interpretation.  Bradford v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 200 (2006).  Most significantly, for claims involving an in-service personal assault, after-the-fact medical evidence can be used to establish a stressor.  See id; Patton, 12 Vet. App. at 278.  \r\n\r\nService treatment records do not reflect that she was treated for a psychiatric disability during active service, or that she complained of any injuries that may be attributable to a physical or sexual assault.  Both her September 1983 separation examination and report of medical history note no psychiatric problems.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran asserts in her July 2010 claim that during active duty from 1980 to 1983, she was sexually assaulted by another woman.  These incidents occurred for one and a half years.  She reported the situation to her company commander on numerous occasions.  The woman who was assaulting her was later transferred from Baumholder, West Germany, to Stugart, West Germany.  She elaborated in a November 2010 statement that from 1981 to 1982 in Baumholder, West Germany, she was assaulted by a woman named D. G.  After she returned from the military, the Veteran was still haunted by the assaults.  She experienced depression, substance abuse, alcohol, drugs, breakup of primary relationship (divorce), changes in performance and evaluations, and request change of duty assignment due to these alleged assaults.  In another November 2010 statement, she states Captain H. was aware of the situation and never acted upon it until the alleged assailant and the Veteran became embroiled in many fights.  This was when the alleged assailant was finally transferred.  \r\n\r\nVA mental health clinical records, from January 2011 to April 2012 reveal that the Veteran underwent psychotherapy sessions with a licensed clinical social worker.  These records details the Veteran's reported the assault began while she was in the 8th Infantry Division HHC 708th Maintenance Battalion.  The Veteran reported the alleged assailant was in her company and they lived in the same barracks.  The alleged assailant had befriended her and several months later arranged to be her roommate.  They were roommates for about two months then the alleged assailant made her first sexual overture to her.  During the forced relationship, she started using drugs and alcohol and used for 16 years.  She further states she experienced job instability and a poor and distance relationship with her daughter.  The Veteran reported the alleged assailant requested to be reassigned and was sent to Fort Riley.  The Veteran also requested to be reassigned, but completed her 18 month assignment at the duty station.  The Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD related to military sexual trauma.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran submitted a statement in June 2011 from a fellow solider, G.E.H., who states he was stationed with the Veteran in Baumholder, West Germany, under the 8th Infantry Division HHC 708th Maintenance Battalion.  They were located at this location from 1981-1983.  He was friends with the Veteran.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran further contends in a June 2012 statement that she informed her base superiors, Captain B.H. and First Sergeant W.D.W. of the abuse.  In 2013, the Veteran submitted lay statements from her daughter, friend, sister, and fellow ministry member discussing the Veteran's unhappiness and troubled behavior after the alleged assault period.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran avers in an August 2013 statement that during service she started acting out and after service she had a criminal history, which further supports her claim for PTSD.  In September 2015 the Veteran submitted an April 1983 service personnel record that states the Veteran's rank had been reduced to PV2/E2.  She further submitted another service personnel record that was dated October 1981, but was otherwise illegible.  She identified it as an Article 15 she received in Germany after the alleged assault.  Additionally, she submitted her civilian criminal record report, which indicates numerous offenses since 1986.  \r\n\r\nDuring her September 2015 Board hearing, G.E.H. testified by phone, stating he saw the Veteran being attacked by the alleged assailant numerous times.  He elaborated that other people saw the events, but did not get involved.  He reported these events to his superiors, specifically first sergeant W.D.W. and company commander B.H.  He believed there was a connection between the B.H. and the alleged assailant.  The Veteran stated these assaults occurred until the alleged assailant, who was a private first class, was transferred out sometime between January 1982 and July 1982.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, in September 2015 she submitted another statement from G.E.H., in which he states he witnessed the Veteran being physically assaulted by the alleged assailant.  He further notes that he was told by other soldiers that the alleged assailant could \"get away with murder,\" as her and the company commander were closer friends.  In another statement by G.E.H. submitted in September 2015, he notes the Veteran told him about the sexual assaults and he reported these incidents to the first sergeant, who retired shortly after, then reported it to the new first sergeant.  When nothing was done he reported it to his section sergeant, who set up an appointment with his company commander Captain B.H.  G.E.H. explains he waited a few weeks then requested to see the ballation commander and waited several months, but the matter was never looked into.  \r\n\r\nWhile the Veteran has been seen by a VA licensed clinical social worker who has diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD related to the claimed in-service sexual assault trauma, the Veteran has yet to undergo an psychiatric examination by a VA psychiatrist or psychologist.  In light of the Veteran's complaints of an in-service sexual assault, her mental health treatment containing diagnoses of an acquired psychiatric disorder since service, service personnel records showing disciplinary actions, criminal record since service, and statements from G.E.H., the Board finds that the Veteran should be afforded a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of any acquired psychiatric disorder.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83 (2006).  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1. Obtain and associate with the claims file any additional  evidence relevant to mental health that may have come into existence since the claims folder was last before the AOJ.\r\n\r\n2. Schedule the Veteran for an appropriate VA psychiatric examination for the purpose of ascertaining the nature and etiology of the claimed psychiatric disorder.  All appropriate tests and studies should be performed and all clinical findings reported in detail.  The claims file should be provided to the appropriate examiner for review, and the examiner should note that it has been reviewed.   For any and all diagnosed psychiatric disorder(s), the examiner shall offer an  opinion as to the following questions:\r\n\r\nIs it at least as likely as not (at least a 50 percent probability) that any diagnosed psychiatric disabilities began during or was caused by her active duty service? Specifically, is it at least as likely as not that the Veteran has PTSD as a result of military sexual assault trauma?  Why or why not? \r\n\r\nNote: The examiner is reminded that the term \"as likely as not\" does not mean \"within the realm of medical possibility,\" but rather that the evidence of record is so evenly divided that, in the examiner's expert opinion, it is as medically sound to find in favor of the proposition as it is to find against it.\r\n\r\nA rationale for all medical opinions shall be provided.  If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resorting to speculation, he or she shall provide complete explanations stating why this is so.  In so doing, the examiner shall explain whether any inability to provide a more definitive opinion is the result of a need for additional information, or that he or she has exhausted the limits of current medical knowledge in providing an answer to that particular question.\r\n\r\n3. Then, readjudicate the claim.  If the claim remains denied, a supplemental statement of the case should be provided to the Veteran and her representative.  After they have had an adequate opportunity to respond, the case should be returned to the Board for further appellate review. \r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.

Gibbs, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty from July 1970 to January 1972.  This matter is before the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) on appeal of a September 2012 rating decision by the St. Louis, Missouri Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which denied service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe record shows a psychiatric diagnosis other than PTSD.  In accordance with Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009), the claim seeking service connection for PTSD has been recharacterized, as shown on the first page of this document, to encompass any psychiatric disability shown, however diagnosed.  \r\n\r\nThe issue of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the Veteran if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he currently has PTSD.  He points to his military service in Vietnam as the cause of the disorder.  For example, at the time of a VA examination in September 2012, the Veteran reported such stressors as hostile/sniper fire near his bunker location during night time hours, and an incident when a flare was accidentally set off in a bunker. \r\n\r\nOn the September 2012 VA examination, the examiner found that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, but opined, in part, that the Veteran was suffering from adjustment disorder with depressed mood, associated with complicated bereavement stemming from his son's tragic death in a house fire in the early 1970s.  The examiner, however, found that \"the condition is not assessed to be associated with the Veteran's period of service.\" \r\n\r\nAs stated above, the Veteran was discharged from service in January 1972.  A review of the record reveals that there is no documentation that verifies the exact date of death of the Veteran's son, but only a brief statement about the death occurring in the early 1970s.  The Board notes that the 2012 medical record indicates that the death occurred after the Veteran returned from service in Vietnam.  The Board also notes that Veteran's service records indicate that he was released from active duty one day after returning from Vietnam.  However, the Board finds that further development regarding the timeline of events is necessary.  Such information is essential for determining whether an event occurred in service that resulted in or gave rise to the current psychiatric disability.  Therefore, the RO should seek specific information and evidence from the Veteran to verify the basis upon which the diagnosis was made.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Veteran reported VA treatment in Tulsa, Oklahoma, around 1982, and more recently at the VAMC in Columbia, Missouri.  These records should be obtained.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a medical diagnosis that differs from the claimed condition - in this case, PTSD - does not necessarily represent a separate claim; and what constitutes a claim cannot be limited by a lay veteran's assertion of his condition in his application, but must be construed based on the reasonable expectations of the non-expert claimant and the evidence developed in processing the claim.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. (2009).  Therefore, not only must the issue on appeal now be characterized generally as one of service connection for a psychiatric disorder to include PTSD, but further development, under the duty to assist, is also needed.  To that end, the RO should send another Veterans Claim Assistance Act (VCAA) letter to the Veteran.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Ensure VCAA notice is sent to the Veteran in regard to a claim of entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder other than PTSD.\r\n\r\n2.  Request that the Veteran clarify whether his son's death occurred after January 25, 1972, the date he separated from service, and ensure any necessary documentation is associated with the record.  \r\n\r\n3.  Thereafter, secure for the record copies of the Veteran's complete service personnel records, (i.e., his complete 201 file).  If any such documents are unavailable, it should be noted in the record.\r\n\r\n4.  Obtain all outstanding records of relevant VA and non-VA treatment since service, including records of:\r\n\r\na. VA treatment in Tulsa, Oklahoma, around 1982; and\r\nb. VA treatment recently (since approximately 2011) at the VAMC in Columbia, Missouri.\r\n\r\n5.  After the completion of the above development, adjudicate the claim of service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, taking into consideration all evidence added to the file.  If the benefit sought remains denied, furnish the Veteran and his representative an appropriate Supplemental Statement of the Case, and return the case to the Board.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims \r\n\r\nthat are remanded by the Board or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Mitchell, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from May 1978 to July 1981.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2013 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Lincoln, Nebraska.  \r\n\r\nIn August 2015, the Veteran testified during a Board videoconference hearing before the undersigned Acting Veterans Law Judge.  A transcript of that hearing is of record.\r\n\r\nThis appeal includes documents contained in the Virtual VA and Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) paperless claims processing systems.  Accordingly, any future consideration of this appellant's case should take into consideration the existence of all of these records.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nAlthough further delay is regrettable, the Board finds that additional development is necessary prior to appellate review.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has contended that service connection is warranted for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) based on in-service events.  The Veteran asserts that while he was stationed aboard the USS Cleveland (LPD 7), he witnessed several air crashes that resulted in the death of the pilot, and in one instance the Veteran reported that he and the pilot made eye contact before the crash.  The Veteran also asserts that he witnessed soldiers being thrown overboard into the Indian Ocean.  \r\n\r\nIn August 2013, a formal finding of a lack of information required to corroborate stressor(s) associated with the Veteran's claim was completed.  It was determined that the information required to corroborate the stressful events described by the Veteran were insufficient to send to the US Army and Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC).  It was noted that the Veteran's personnel records confirmed he was stationed aboard the USS Cleveland (LPD 7).  \r\n\r\nAt the August 2015 Board hearing, the Veteran provided detailed testimony regarding the stressors of witnessing several air crashes resulting in pilot deaths, and witnessing fellow soldiers being thrown overboard into the Indian Ocean, all occurring during a 180 day tour aboard the USS Cleveland (LPD 7).  While the Veteran does not know the precise dates of the events, he has firmly reiterated that they occurred during the USS Cleveland's 180 day tour in the Indian Ocean.  The Board finds that the Veteran's testimony, and the evidence in the Veteran's personnel records that confirms the Veteran was stationed on the USS Cleveland (LPD 7), is sufficient to verify the Veteran's claimed stressors.  \r\n\r\nAs the Veteran has provided the time frame and duty location of the above stressors (180 days aboard the USS Cleveland LPD 7 in the Indian Ocean), upon remand, the RO should attempt to verify the aforementioned stressors, requesting relevant information from the Veteran where necessary and documenting all efforts during the verification process.  Additionally, on remand, the RO should contact the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Department of the Navy, the Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC), and any other appropriate facility, to attempt to obtain the complete deck logs for the USS Cleveland (LPD 7) for the period from May 1978 to July 1981.\r\n\r\nIf the claimed stressors can be corroborated, the Veteran should be scheduled for a VA psychological examination to determine whether he has a current psychiatric disorder that is related to his military service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Obtain and associate any outstanding VA treatment records pertinent to the claim on appeal.\r\n\r\n2.  Contact the NARA, the Department of the Navy, the JSRRC, and/or any other appropriate facility to request complete deck logs for the USS Cleveland (LPD 7) from May 1978 through July 1981.  Any additional action necessary to obtain copies of the deck logs, to include follow-up action requested by the contacted entity, should be accomplished.  If multiple requests are required to obtain all the information sought, they should be made.  All requests and responses received from each contacted entity should be associated with the claims file.  If the complete deck logs are unavailable, a formal finding of unavailability should be prepared and associated with the claims file.\r\n\r\n3.  Based on the information provided by the Veteran regarding stressors he experienced aboard the USS Cleveland (LPD 7), the RO should take steps to verify the claimed in-service stressors, to include contacting all such entities deemed appropriate to provide any available information which might corroborate the Veteran's claimed stressors.  Such stressors include the report of witnessing several air crashes resulting in pilot deaths, and witnessing fellow soldiers being thrown overboard into the Indian Ocean during a 180 day tour aboard the USS Cleveland (LPD 7) in the Indian Ocean.  \r\n\r\n4.  Upon acknowledgment of any verifiable stressors, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of any current PTSD.  The claims folder should be reviewed and that review should be indicated in the examination report.  The rationale for all opinions should be provided.  Specifically, the examiner should provide the following information:\r\n\r\nAfter examining the Veteran and reviewing the relevant evidence in the Veteran's claims file, the examiner should offer an opinion, consistent with sound medical principles, as to whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent or greater probability) that he has PTSD due to stressors experienced during service, to include his experiences while stationed aboard the USS Cleveland (LPD 7).\r\n\r\nIn rendering the requested opinion, the physician should specifically consider and discuss the Veteran's contentions, lay statements of record, and medical records regarding the conditions and experiences in service and their effect on the Veteran.  The examiner must be informed that the Board accepts as credible the Veteran's assertions with respect to his in-service experiences.\r\n\r\nThe examiner must explain the rationale for all opinions given, citing to supporting factual data and medical literature as deemed appropriate.  \r\n\r\nIf the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, the examiner should provide an explanation as to why this is so, and must state whether there is additional evidence that would permit the necessary opinion to be made.\r\n\r\n5.  Then, readjudicate the claim.  If the decision is adverse to the Veteran, issue a supplemental statement of the case, allow the appropriate time for response, and then return the claim to the Board.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

T. Sprague, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active service in the United States Marine Corps from June 1968 to May 1970.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2009 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in New York, New York.  The claim was before the Board on a previous occasion, and was remanded in May 2013 for evidentiary development.  Unfortunately, the mandates of that remand were not adhered to in their entirety, and, for reasons discussed below, an additional remand is unfortunately necessary.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he developed a current acquired psychiatric disorder as a result of his service in the Marine Corps.  He asserts that he witnessed several distressing incidents both during his recruit training and with his additional service outside of a training environment.  Specifically, he has alleged that, during his recruit training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island (MCRDPI), South Carolina, his drill instructors were exceptionally harsh in their tormenting of recruits.  He has asserted that a garbage can was placed over his head while a whistle was blown into it and that his mother and sister's photographs were mocked in sexually suggestive and offensive manners in front of him.  Further, while there is some confusion with regard to the physical state of the personnel he has claimed to witness, he has alleged that he came upon two Marine recruits who attempted suicide and, apparently, was told that one of these individuals later died.  He also asserts that there were other attempts at suicide throughout the base because of the harsh nature of the training.  Lastly, he asserts that while outside of training, he saw wounded Marines transit through his location on return from assignment in Vietnam (to include those who lost limbs).  The Veteran was stationed in Okinawa, Japan, which, as a Pacific Island, is en route to the United States for flights originating in Southeast Asia.  \r\n\r\nThe claim has been before the Board on a previous occasion, and it was directed that an opinion be afforded with respect to currently-diagnosed PTSD and bipolar disorder.  Specifically, the Board noted that the Veteran, during active service, developed a duodenal ulcer which required a period of hospitalization.  The Veteran has asserted that the ulcer was resultant from symptoms of anxiety and stress experienced during his recruit training at MCRDPI.  It was requested that the examiner review this evidence, as well as the statements of the Veteran and the medical evidence or record, to determine as to if the ulcer was resultant from high levels of mental stress and psychiatric impairment experienced during the intense period of Marine Corps recruit training.  The returned opinion, dated in November 2013, did not address this question at all.  An addendum was entered, however, in April 2014, in which the examiner stated that PTSD was not caused by the presence of an ulcer.  This was not what was asked by the Board, and thus, cannot be considered an acceptable opinion for purposes of evaluating the Veteran's condition.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner, in her addendum opinion, noted that bipolar disorder is \"explained by bio-psycho-social methods.\"  In explaining what this means, it was described that there is potentially a genetic component, and that \"psychosocial means some psychological and social factors could cause these disorders\" and that \"sometimes we do not find any cause.\"  This rationale is not adequate to address the issue on appeal.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).  \r\n\r\nIndeed, the Veteran has expressly contended that the social environment of the Marine Corps Recruit Depot caused him to develop anxiety and mood problems.  He asserts that these were so severe that an ulcer was developed and that he has had long-standing mood difficulties.  Additional medical records, dating to April 2008, show the Veteran as complaining, in a clinical setting (prior to the filing of his claim for compensation), of \"long-standing\" problems with mood and irritability, and a June 2009 opinion, authored by the same examiner who examined the Veteran's claims file in 2013 and 2014, noted that PTSD was related to generalized boot camp experiences (no rationale is associated with this opinion).  \r\n\r\nGiven the failure to adequately address the Board's questions, the claim must be remanded for remedial development.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998).  In this regard, the Board notes that there is ample evidence that the Veteran experiences bipolar or other mood disorder in addition to also having a historical diagnosis of PTSD.  It is requested that the Veteran be sent to an examiner other than the one who examined the Veteran in 2009 (and reviewed the claim in 2013 and 2014) for a new, comprehensive opinion addressing the nature and etiology of any currently present acquired psychiatric disability.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Schedule the Veteran for a comprehensive VA psychiatric examination with an examiner other than the one who examined him in 2009 (and reviewed his claim in 2013 and 2014).  In this regard, it is asked if it is at least as likely as not (50 percent probability or greater) that any current acquired psychiatric disability, to include bipolar disorder, PTSD, or any other mood disorder, had causal origins in active service.  Specifically, the examiner must reference the Veteran's in-service assessment of duodenal ulcer at the time proximate to his recruit training at MCRDPI, and should opine as to if this resulted from high anxiety/stress symptoms which were early manifestations of current psychiatric problems.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner should note the Veteran's assertions of the stressful nature of recruit training for Marines during the Vietnam era (his reports of loud banging on garbage cans and insults to his female relatives in his presence, etc.), and should also note his reports of seeing injured Marines return from Vietnam via his duty station on Okinawa.  Commentary should be made as to if the psychosocial factors associated with the extreme environment of Marine Corps Recruit Training of 1968 contributed to the onset of current acquired psychiatric disability.   \r\n\r\nA detailed rationale must be associated with every conclusion offered in the narrative portion of the examination report.  The lack of documentation in the service treatment records, in itself, is not a sufficient basis on which to form a rationale (and any opinion which relies solely on this will be returned for remedial action).  Should consultations with other specialists be necessary (i.e. gastroenterology with respect to the alleged relationship of ulcers to in-service psychological stress), the examiner should feel free to refer the case.  \r\n\r\n2.  Upon completion of the above-directed development, re-adjudicate the Veteran's claim.  Should the claim remain denied, issue an appropriate supplemental statement of the case and return the claim to the Board for adjudication.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.

Spragins, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active service in the United States Army from May 1969 to November 1971.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2012 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Huntington, West Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe record shows that an April 2009 VA Form 21-22 appointed the West Virginia Division of Veterans Affairs as the Veteran's representative.  The Board notes that this veterans service organization has since been redesignated as the West Virginia Department of Veterans Assistance.  See W. Va. Code � 9A-1-1 (2011).\r\n\r\nIn a July 2015 decision, the Board reopened the claim for service connection for PTSD and expanded the issue to encompass all acquired psychiatric disorders.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  The Board granted service connection for an anxiety disorder NOS and denied service connection for PTSD.  As such, the only issue remaining on appeal was entitlement to an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD and anxiety disorder NOS.  The Board remanded that issue for further development in July 2015, and the case has since been returned to the Board for appellate review.\r\n\r\nThis appeal was processed using the Virtual VA paperless claims processing system and the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS).  Accordingly, any future consideration of this case should take into consideration the existence of these records.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ.  VA will notify the Veteran if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn the July 2015 remand, the Board determined that a VA examination was needed  to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's psychiatric disorders other than PTSD and an anxiety disorder NOS.  Specifically, the Board directed the examiner to provide a diagnosis of any acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD and anxiety disorder NOS, and if he or she disagreed with a diagnosis in file, the examiner should explain why the diagnosis was not warranted.  It was noted that the Veteran had been assessed as having a mood disorder NOS and dysthymia with agitated mood.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2015 at which time he was diagnosed with an unspecified anxiety disorder.  However, he is already service-connected for that disability, and the examiner did not address any of the other diagnoses of record.  Therefore, an additional VA examination and medical opinion are needed to ensure compliance with the prior remand. See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  The AOJ should request that the Veteran provide the names and addresses of any and all health care providers who have provided treatment for a psychiatric disorder.  After acquiring this information and obtaining any necessary authorization, the AOJ should obtain and associate these records with the claims file.\r\n\r\nThe AOJ should also secure any outstanding, relevant VA medical records, to include any treatment records from the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center dated since September 2015.\r\n\r\n2.  After completing the above actions, the Veteran should be scheduled for a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of any current acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD and anxiety disorder NOS.  Any studies, tests, and evaluations deemed necessary by the examiner should be performed.\r\n\r\nThe examiner is requested to review all pertinent records associated with the claims file, including the Veteran's service treatment records, post-service medical records, and statements.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the Veteran is competent to attest to factual matters of which he had first-hand knowledge, including observable symptomatology.  If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner should provide a fully reasoned explanation.\r\n\r\nThe examiner should identify all current psychiatric disorders.  He or she should specifically indicate whether the Veteran has dysthymia, persistent depressive disorder, insomnia, and mood disorder NOS.  If not, the examiner should address the prior diagnoses of record and explain why such a diagnosis is not warranted.\r\n\r\nFor each diagnosis identified other than PTSD and anxiety disorder NOS, the examiner should opine whether it is at least as likely as not that the disorder manifested in or is otherwise related to the Veteran's military service.\r\n\r\n(The term \"at least as likely as not\" does not mean within the realm of medical possibility, but rather that the medical evidence both for and against a conclusion is so evenly divided that it is as medically sound to find favor of conclusion as it is to find against it).\r\n\r\nA clear rationale for all opinions would be helpful and a discussion of the facts and medical principles involved would be of considerable assistance to the Board.  Because it is important \"that each disability be viewed in relation to its history[,]\" 38 C.F.R. � 4.1, copies of all pertinent records in the Veteran's claims file, or in the alternative, the claim file, must be made available to the examiner for review.\r\n\r\n3.  After completing the foregoing development, the AOJ should conduct any other development as may be indicated as a consequence of the actions taken in the preceding paragraphs.\r\n\r\n4.  Thereafter, the case should be reviewed by the AOJ on the basis of the additional evidence.  If the benefits sought are not granted, the Veteran and his representative should be furnished a Supplemental Statement of the Case and be afforded a reasonable opportunity to respond before the record is returned to the Board for further review.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Ryan, Associate Counsel \r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from December 1969 to July 1971.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2010 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe December 2014 Board remand instructed the AOJ to schedule the Veteran for a VA psychological examination to determine the nature and etiology of his claimed mental disorder.  A review of the record reveals that the Veteran missed his examination due to a medical emergency.  The Veteran has requested that the examination be rescheduled.  As the Veteran has presented good cause for his failure to appear at the examination, his request will be granted and another mental health examination should be scheduled in compliance with the Board's initial remand directives.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998). \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Schedule the Veteran for a new VA examination with an appropriately qualified mental health professional to determine the nature and etiology of any current acquired psychiatric disorder.  The claims file, including a copy of this REMAND, must be made available to the examiner.  A record of the review of the claims file should be documented in the examination report.\r\n\r\nFollowing the examination of the Veteran and a review of the record, the examiner should provide a medical opinion addressing the following:\r\n\r\na.  Identify the current psychiatric diagnoses.\r\n\r\nb.  State whether the prior psychiatric diagnoses in the VA treatment records and the private treatment records to include PTSD, alcohol dependence, depressive disorder, NOS, anxiety disorder, mood disorder, and adjustment disorder with mixed features, are valid.  If not, state why.\r\n\r\nc.  For each diagnosed psychiatric disorder, the examiner should provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent probability or more) that the disorder had its onset in service or is otherwise etiologically related to his military service.\r\n\r\nIn answering the above, the VA examiner should consider and address the Veteran's lay statements regarding the nature and history of his mental health symptoms.\r\n\r\nAll examination findings, along with the complete rationale for all opinions expressed, should be discussed in the examination report.\r\n\r\n2.  After the above has been completed, the RO must review the claims file and ensure that all of the foregoing development actions have been conducted and completed in full.  If any development is incomplete, appropriate corrective action must be implemented.  If any report does not include adequate responses to the specific opinions requested, it must be returned to the providing examiner for corrective action.\r\n\r\n3.  Thereafter, readjudicate the issue on appeal. \r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v.

Watkins, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from January 1989 to January 2012.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder claim comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2012 rating decision of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Paul, Minnesota, which denied the benefit sought on appeal.  The Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) in March 2012.  The RO issued a Statement of the Case (SOC) in May 2012.  In January 2013, the Veteran filed his Substantive Appeal.  Thus, the Veteran perfected a timely appeal of this issue.  The acquired psychiatric disorder was originally decided as two issues, but due to the similarity of the symptoms, the Board has combined the issues into one issue of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.\r\n\r\nThis appeal was processed using the VBMS paperless claims processing system.  Accordingly, any future consideration of this Veteran's case should take into consideration the existence of this electronic record, in addition to the Veteran's Virtual VA paperless claims file.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the Veteran if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA psychiatric examination in February 2012.  He was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.  The VA examiner then provided a medical nexus opinion regarding the secondary service connection theory of the Veteran's claim.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310 (2015).  However, the VA examiner did not provide a medical nexus opinion regarding the direct service connection theory of the Veteran's claim (i.e., whether the acquired psychiatric disorder had its onset in service or is otherwise etiologically related to service).  38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (2015).  \r\nBased on the Veteran's lay statements of an in-service incurrence of the acquired psychiatric disorder and the anxiety disorder diagnosis shortly after service in February 2012, this medical opinion is necessary before the Veteran's claim can be decided on the merits.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(d) (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.159(c)(4) (2015).  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, upon remand, all pertinent treatment records for the claimed psychiatric disorders must be obtained.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(a)(1), (b)(1), (c)(1) (West 2014).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  Send the Veteran a letter asking him to provide the names and addresses of all physicians who have treated him for his claimed psychiatric disorders since service.  After obtaining any necessary authorizations from the Veteran, obtain and associate with the record all pertinent treatment records.\r\n\r\n2.  Thereafter, schedule the Veteran for an appropriate VA examination to ascertain the nature and etiology of the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, to include anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and PTSD.  Any and all indicated evaluations, studies, and tests deemed necessary by the examiner should be accomplished.  The claims file and a copy of this Remand must be made available to the examiner.  The examiner shall note in the examination report that the claims folder and the Remand have been reviewed.  \r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the record, the examiner should offer medical opinions on the following:\r\n\r\na) State whether the Veteran has a current psychiatric diagnosis, to include anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and/or PTSD, consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV).  \r\n\r\nb) If the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD, state whether it is based on an incident of the Veteran's service, to include fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.\r\n\r\nc) If the Veteran has a current psychiatric diagnosis other than PTSD, is it at least as likely as not (a 50 percent probability or greater) that the acquired psychiatric disorder had its onset in service or is otherwise etiologically related to service?  In forming the medical opinion, the examiner is asked to address and consider the anxiety disorder diagnosis in February 2012, a month after the Veteran's military discharge in January 2012.\r\n\r\nA complete rationale must be provided for all opinions offered, and the examiner must consider and discuss the Veteran's lay statements regarding his history and symptomatology concerning his disability.\r\n\r\n3.  After the above actions have been completed, readjudicate the Veteran's claim.  If the claim remains denied, issue to the Veteran and his representative a Supplemental SOC (SSOC).  Afford them the appropriate period of time within which to respond thereto.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Cannaday, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from November 1965 to September 1967.  His awards and decorations include the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Vietnam Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the Veteran's DD-214 indicates that he that he served as a light weapons infantryman in the Republic of Vietnam.  \r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2009 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nThe Board remanded the case for further development in March 2015.  The case has since been returned to the Board for appellate review\r\n\r\nThis appeal was processed using the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS).  The Virtual VA electronic claims file contains documents that are either duplicative of the records in VBMS or irrelevant to the issue on appeal.  The Board notes that the appellant's representative indicated that there is a notification in VBMS that documents are \"currently pending scanning.\"  However, although there is a notice in VBMS that the Veteran's \"C-File\" was listed as an item pending scanning as of March 10, 2015, a review of VBMS reflects that the Veteran's claims file was scanned on March 17, 2015, and additional documents were scanned in thereafter following receipt.  Moreover, the appellant's representative states that the Veteran's file seems to be complete.  Thus, the Board finds that it has a complete file upon which to adjudicate the Veteran's claim.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's CVA did not manifest during active service or within one year of his separation from service, is not otherwise related to active service, is not related to his herbicide exposure, and is not caused or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's CVA was not incurred in active service, may not be presumed to have been so incurred, and is not proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated by a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1110, 1112, 1116 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309 (2015).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a substantially complete application for benefits, VA must notify the claimant what information or evidence is needed in order to substantiate the claim and it must assist the claimant by making reasonable efforts to get the evidence needed.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5103(a), 5103A; 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b); see Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183, 187 (2002).  The notice required must be provided to the claimant before the initial unfavorable decision on a claim for VA benefits, and it must (1) inform the claimant about the information and evidence not of record that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) inform the claimant about the information and evidence that VA will seek to provide; and (3) inform the claimant about the information and evidence the claimant is expected to provide.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b)(1); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 120 (2004).\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of an application for a service-connection claim, VA must review the information and the evidence presented with the claim and provide the claimant with notice of what information and evidence not previously provided, if any, will assist in substantiating, or is necessary to substantiate, each of the five elements of the claim, including notice of what is required to establish service connection and that a disability rating and an effective date for the award of benefits will be assigned if service connection is awarded.  See Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the RO provided the Veteran with a notification letter in April 2009, prior to the initial decision on the claim.  Therefore, the timing requirement of the notice as set forth in Pelegrini has been met and to decide the appeal would not be prejudicial to the claimant.  Moreover, the requirements of the notice were met in this case.  In the letter, the RO notified the Veteran of the evidence necessary to substantiate the claim and of the division of responsibilities in obtaining such evidence.  The letter also explained how disability ratings and effective dates are determined.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the duty to assist the Veteran has also been satisfied in this case.  The Veteran's service treatment records as well as all identified and available post-service medical records are in the claims file.  The Veteran has not identified any available, outstanding records that are relevant to the claim decided herein. \r\n\r\nFurther, the Veteran was afforded VA examinations in May 2009 and April 2015.  When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).  The Board finds that the April 2015 VA medical opinion is adequate to decide the case because it is based on an accurate factual premise and a review of the claims file, including the Veteran's reported medical history, complaints, and lay statements.  The opinion also addresses the central medical issues and is supported by an adequate rationale.  Accordingly, the Board finds that VA's duty to assist with respect to obtaining a VA examination or opinion for the issue on appeal has been met.  38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(4).\r\n\r\nAs noted above, the case was remanded in March 2015 to afford the Veteran a new VA examination regarding the etiology of his CVA.  The Veteran was afforded with a new VA examination that addressed the questions in the March 2015 remand.  Accordingly, the remand directives were ultimately accomplished and, as such, there has been substantial compliance with the prior remand instructions.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998); see also Dyment v. West, 13 Vet.App. 141, 146-47 (1999) (requiring substantial compliance with a remand order).\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the Board concludes that VA has fulfilled the duties to notify and assist the Veteran in this case.  Hence, there is no error or issue that precludes the Board from addressing the merits of this appeal. \r\n\r\nLaw and analysis\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131.  Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).\r\n\r\nIn addition, for Veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.307, 3.309.\r\n\r\nFor the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  If chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim.  38 C.F.R. �� 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).\r\n\r\nFurther, if a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service, certain diseases shall be service-connected if the requirements of section 3.307(a)(6) are met even though there is no record of such disease during service, provided further that the rebuttable presumption provisions of section 3.307(d) are also satisfied.  38 C.F.R. � 3.309(e).  Section 3.307(d)(6) provides that the term \"herbicide agent\" means a chemical in an herbicide used in support of the United States and allied military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975. 38 C.F.R. � 3.307(d)(6)(i).  Section 3.307(d)(6) also provides that a veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.307(d)(6)(iii).  Service in the Republic of Vietnam includes service in the waters offshore and service in other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam.  Id.  \r\n\r\nThe diseases presumed to be associated with herbicide exposure include: chloracne or other acneform diseases consistent with chloracne, type 2 diabetes (also known as type II diabetes or adult-onset diabetes), Hodgkin's disease, ischemic heart disease (including, but not limited to, acute, subacute, and old myocardial infarction; atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease including coronary artery disease (including coronary spasm) and coronary bypass surgery; and stable, unstable and Prinzmetal's angina), all chronic B-cell leukemias (including, but not limited to, hairy-cell leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia), multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Parkinson's disease, acute and subacute peripheral neuropathy, porphyria cutanea tarda, prostate cancer, respiratory cancers (cancer of the lung, bronchus, larynx, or trachea), and soft-tissue sarcomas (other than osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, or mesothelioma).  38 C.F.R. � 3.309(e). \r\n\r\nThe diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(e) shall have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more any time after service, except that chloracne, porphyria cutanea tarda, and acute and subacute peripheral neuropathy shall have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within a year after the last date on which the veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.307(a)(6)(ii). \r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs has determined that there is no positive association between exposure to herbicides and any other condition for which the Secretary has not specifically determined that a presumption of service connection is warranted.  See Notice, 67 Fed. Reg. 42600 -42608 (2002). Notwithstanding the foregoing, regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d); see also Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  In other words, a presumption of service connection provided by law is not the sole method for showing causation in establishing a claim for service connection for disability due to herbicide exposure.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007) (holding that the availability of presumptive service connection for some conditions based on exposure to Agent Orange does not preclude direct service connection for other conditions based on exposure to Agent Orange).\r\n\r\nIn considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board concludes that the evidence of record weighs against a finding that the Veteran is entitled to service connection for CVA.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has contended that his CVA is related to his military service, to include his exposure to herbicides therein and as secondary to his service-connected PTSD.  See August 2009 Notice of Disagreement; April 2009 Statement in Support of Claim.  Specifically, the Veteran has stated that he was sprayed twice with Agent Orange, drank water, and ate food that was exposed to Agent Orange.  See April 2009 Statement in Support of Claim; April 2010 Statement in Support of Claim.  The Veteran has also contended that his CVA happened as a result of his PTSD.  Specifically, he has indicated that his heart races from PTSD, which could affect his atrial fibrillation.  Additionally, the Veteran has indicated that he smoked due to the stress of the job, and that the May 2009 VA examiner indicated that his stroke could be related to his smoking.  See May 2015 Correspondence; May 2009 VA examination.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, the Veteran's awards and decorations include the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Vietnam Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the Veteran's DD-214 indicates that he that he served as a light weapons infantryman in the Republic of Vietnam.  Therefore, based on the Veteran's in-country service in Vietnam, it is presumed that he was exposed to herbicides.  Moreover, the Veteran's PTSD is a service-connected disability.  As such, the remaining question is whether the Veteran's CVA is related to his herbicide exposure in service or to his service-connected PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran stated that he believes that most of his health problems are due to Agent Orange exposure and being in combat.  See April 2009 Statement in Support of Claim.  However, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not document any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of CVA.  Further, there is no indication in the Veteran's STRs that he complained of CVA or any symptoms related to CVA.  Importantly, at his October 1965 pre-induction examination the Veteran's heart and vascular system was marked as normal.  Similarly, at his September 1967 clinical evaluation, his heart and vascular system was marked as normal.  \r\n\r\nThe post-service medical evidence shows that the Veteran had his CVA in January 2009.  See January 2009 VA treatment record.  Specifically, a January 2009 VA treatment record shows that the Veteran was admitted to the Milwaukee VA medical center (VAMC) for right sided weakness and numbness.  The Veteran denied a headache, change in vision, trauma, pain, palpitations, chest pain, slurring of speech or facial weakness.  At that visit, the Veteran was given a primary diagnosis of CVA with a secondary diagnosis of Paroxysmal A. fib.  The doctor noted that the Veteran's symptoms began to resolve 36 hours after onset and was much improved with residual patchy numbness on discharge.  The Veteran was prescribed to continue to take Lovenox injections for 10 days following discharge, and to take Warfarin as scheduled per anticoagulation clinic.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the evidence weighing against a showing that the Veteran's CVA manifested during active duty service or within close proximity thereto, the Board further finds that the weight of the evidence of record does not establish a link between the Veteran's CVA and his military service or his service-connected PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA examination in May 2009.  At that examination, the examiner opined that the Veteran's CVA was less likely than not related to his service-connected PTSD and most likely due to his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with embolus originating from the heart or from peripheral venous circulation traversing to the left atrium through the patent foramen ovale.  The examiner stated that his diffuse ischemic white matter changes of the brain are most likely related to his past history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking.  The opinion from that examination was not adequate to decide the issue and so a new examination and opinion was obtained in April 2015.  Thus, the May 2009 VA opinion is of limited probative value.\r\n\r\nIn the April 2015 opinion, the examiner confirmed that the CVA occurred in January 2009.  However, the examiner opined that the Veteran's CVA less likely than not originated during his period of active service or is otherwise etiologically related to his active service, to include exposure to Agent Orange, was caused by his service connected PTSD, or was permanently worsened by his service connected PTSD.  In so finding, the examiner indicated that the Veteran's neurologist provided an assessment of a cardioembolic stroke secondary to paroxysmal A fibb (atrial fibrillation).  The examiner then explained that assessment, stating that a blood clot developed in the Veteran's heart secondary to his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation while he was not anticoagulated, and that a blood clot embolized to his brain causing the ischemic stroke.  This indicates that the examiner knows the precise cause of the Veteran's CVA.  Further, the examiner noted that the Veteran's stroke occurred more than 40 years after exiting active military service and that a cardioembolic ischemic stroke is not an Agent Orange presumptive disease.  The examiner further opined that the Veteran's stroke was not caused by or related to active military service, Agent Orange, or his service-connected PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds the April 2015 opinion to have significant probative value.  The examiner reviewed the claims file, performed an in-person examination, considered the Veteran's reported history, and supported his conclusions with an adequate supporting rationale.  He also addressed the Veteran's contentions in this case. \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the Veteran provided a March 2009 medical opinion from his Milwaukee VAMC Doctor.  In that medical opinion, the Doctor opined that the Veteran's CVA is at least as likely as not related to his diagnosis of PTSD.  However, as the Doctor did not provide a rationale for his opinion, the Board finds that his medical opinion of limited probative value.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet.App. 295, 304 (2008) (noting that \"most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning\"); Stefl, 21 Vet.App. at 125 (holding that \"a mere conclusion by a medical doctor is insufficient to allow the Board to make an informed decision as to what weight to assign to a doctor's opinion\"); see also Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 107 (2012) (stating, \"if the opinion is merely lacking in detail, then it may be given some weight based upon the amount of information and analysis it contains.\").  \r\n\r\nThe Board has also considered the Veteran's lay statements.  Specifically, that the Veteran's his health problems are related to his exposure to Agent Orange and that his CVA is related to his PTSD.  The Veteran is certainly competent to report observable symptoms.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, the Board finds that he is not competent to provide an opinion as to whether his CVA is attributable to exposure to Agent Orange or to his PTSD, as that matter involves complex medical determinations based upon internal medical processes and is not capable of lay observation.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet.App. 428, 438 (2011) (Lance, J. concurring) (\"[T]he beliefs of lay witnesses (including claimants) on issues of diagnosis and medical causation are not competent evidence in situations where those issues require medical expertise to resolve.\"); see also Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 n. 4 (\"Sometimes the layperson will be competent to identify the condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer.\").  The Veteran has not contended, and the evidence does not show, that he has the medical expertise to provide such opinions.  See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377; Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 465.\r\n\r\nMoreover, even if the lay statements of record were competent to determine that the Veteran's CVA is related to his herbicide exposure or his PTSD, the Board finds that the specific, reasoned opinion of the April 2015 VA examiner is of greater probative weight than the lay assertions and the March 2009 medical opinion in this regard.  The examiner performed an in-person examination, reviewed the claims file, the Veteran's own reported history, and the lay statements of the Veteran.  He also has training, knowledge, and expertise on which he relied to form his opinion.  In addition, he addressed the Veteran's contentions and provided an adequate rationale for the conclusion reached.  As such, the Board finds that the April 2015 VA examiner's opinion is of greater probative weight than the combined probative weight of the Veteran's lay statements and the March 2009 medical opinion.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Board notes that the Veteran has indicated that he smoked because of the stress of service and that there is a report stating that his stroke could be from smoking.  With regard to tobacco use, for claims filed after June 9, 1998, the law prohibits service connection of a death or disability on the basis that it resulted from an injury or disease attributable to the use of tobacco products by a Veteran during active duty service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1103 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.300(a) (2015).  \"Tobacco products\" means cigars, cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco.  Id. \r\n\r\nService connection, however, is not precluded where the disability or death resulted from a disease or injury that is otherwise shown to have been incurred or aggravated during service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.300(b)(1).  For purposes of this section, \"otherwise shown\" means that the disability or death can be service-connected on some basis other than the Veteran's use of tobacco products during service.  Id.  \r\n\r\nVA's Office of General Counsel has explained that the legal bar to service connection for a disability or death attributable to tobacco use does not bar a finding of secondary service connection for a disability or death related to the Veteran's use of tobacco products after the Veteran's service, where that disability or death is proximately due to or aggravated by a service-connected disability that is not service-connected on the basis of being attributable to the Veteran's use of tobacco products during service.  VAOPGCPREC 6-2003 (October 28, 2003).  In other words, secondary service connection may be established for disability or death related to post-service tobacco use that is the result of or aggravated by a service-connected disability unrelated to tobacco use.  Id.  The GC opinion further held that VA adjudicators must resolve (1) whether the service-connected disability caused the Veteran to use tobacco products after service; (2) if so, whether the use of tobacco products as a result of the service-connected disability was a substantial factor in causing a secondary disability; and (3) whether the secondary disability would not have occurred but for the use of tobacco products caused by the service-connected disability.  If these questions are answered in the affirmative, the secondary disability or death may be service-connected.  Id.  \r\n\r\nUpon review of the evidence, the Board finds that the most probative evidence of record does not establish that the Veteran's CVA was proximately due to or aggravated by the Veteran's service connected PTSD.  Here, as stated above, the April 2015 examiner specifically indicated that he could determine the cause of the Veteran's CVA.  The examiner explained that a blood clot developed in the Veteran's heart secondary to his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation while he was not anticoagulated, and that blood clot embolized to his brain causing the ischemic stroke.  Additionally, the examiner specifically opined that the Veteran's stroke was not caused by or permanently worsened the Veteran's service-connected PTSD.  \r\n\r\nImportantly, the Board notes that the Veteran, himself, has indicated that his stroke was related to being taken off of the medication warfarin.  The Veteran stated that a Doctor told him that he was taking the Veteran off of warfarin, because the Veteran was under 70 and had not had a stroke.  The Veteran stated that the Doctor must not have checked his file to see why the Veteran was on it.  Further, the Veteran stated that by the time the he tried to see his primary Doctor, he had already had the stroke.  See May 2015 Correspondence.  The Board notes that there is no indication of record that the Veteran is taking warfarin for any service-connected disability or as a result of exposure to herbicides in service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t(CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim.  As such, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied.  Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for cerebral vascular accident, to include as due to exposure to herbicides and as secondary to service-connected coronary artery disease, is denied.    \r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nANTHONY C.

Hampton, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from February 1957 to February 1960.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an October 2000 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in New York, New York.\r\n\r\nThe Board most recently denied the Veteran's claim in April 2012, and he appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In June 2013, the Court granted a joint motion for remand and returned the case to the Board for action consistent with the joint motion.  Specifically, the parties to the joint motion agreed that the Board erred when it determined that VA had adequately assisted the Veteran in obtaining information to verify his claimed in-service stressors.  Accordingly, in May 2014 the Board remanded the Veteran's claim to the originating agency for additional development.\r\n\r\nThe record before the Board consists of electronic records within Virtual VA and the Veterans Benefits Management System.\r\n\r\nThis appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c) (2015).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nAlthough further delay is regrettable, the Board finds that additional development is required before the Veteran's claim is decided.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran claims that his currently diagnosed PTSD is related to incidents which occurred during his service as an air policeman in Korea from August 4, 1959, to February 5, 1960.  Specifically, the Veteran asserted, first, that he was exposed to hostile fire while on patrol.  The Board notes that while a VA physician stated in a September 1999 letter that the Veteran was exposed to hostile fire while patrolling \"the border,\" the Veteran clarified in April 2002 and March 2007 statements that he had never been sent to the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), but instead was exposed to hostile fire while patrolling the perimeter of Kunsan Air Force Base (AB).  In addition, the Veteran has attributed his PTSD to having witnessed the aftermath of the hanging of Korean civilians (including a young girl with whom he had a close relationship) by a local gang when he was assigned to secure the crime scene.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, in June 2013, the Court granted the parties' joint motion for remand, and remanded the Veteran's claim for action consistent with the joint motion.  In pertinent part, the parties' motion first notes that VA had sent a request to the U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) seeking to verify the Veteran's claimed in-service stressors.  JSRRC responded stating that it had researched the period \"July through December 1959\" and had not found documentation of the stressors.  The parties then noted that JSRRC had not stated whether records from the remaining portion of the Veteran's period of service, from January 1960 to February 1960, were available or had been reviewed, and no follow-up request to JSRRC was made.  As such, the parties agreed that a remand was warranted in order for VA to make an additional request to JSRRC to account for the months of January 1960 and February 1960.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in May 2014 the Board remanded the Veteran's claim for the required development.  Specifically, in pertinent part, the Board instructed the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) to send copies of the Veteran's DD Form 214, service personnel records, and any stressor statements submitted by the Veteran to JSRRC in order for an attempt to be made to verify the Veteran's alleged in-service stressor of \"having been exposed to hostile fire on the border between North and South Korea\" during his period of service, specifically from January 1960 through February 1960.\r\n\r\nThe AOJ subsequently received the Veteran's service personnel records, which showed that he served as an air policeman in the 6167th Support Squadron at Kimpo AB in Korea from August 4, 1959, to August 20, 1959, and with the 6175th Support Squadron at Kunsan AB from August 24, 1959, to February 4, 1960.  The AOJ then sent an additional verification request to JSRRC in May 2015 and received a response stating: \"[w]e researched the July to December 1959 history submitted by the 6314th Air Base Wing (6314th ABW), the higher headquarters of the 6167th Support Squadron (6167th SS).  The history documents the mission of the 6167th SS was to operate and maintain Kimpo Air Base (AB), Korea, and to provide air base support of units assigned or attached to the 6167th SS at Kimpo AB.  Unfortunately, the history does not document that the unit came under hostile fire.  Therefore, we are unable to document that [the Veteran] was exposed to hostile fire while patrolling the North and South Korean borders.\"\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that a remand by the Court or the Board confers on the Veteran, as a matter of law, a right to compliance with the remand instructions and imposes upon VA a concomitant duty to ensure compliance with the terms of the remand.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998).  In this regard, the Board notes that like JSRRC's response obtained prior to the Court's remand, the latest response is confined to the period of July 1959 to December 1959, and does not address the Veteran's period of service in January and February 1960.  Importantly, the omitted time period forms a portion of the Veteran's service at Kunsan AB, where his claimed exposure to hostile fire took place.  Because the absence of a response from JSRRC accounting for the entirety of the Veteran's service was the reason for the Court's remand, and because no such response has been obtained, the Board finds that an additional remand is required.\r\n\r\nThe Board also notes that JSRRC's response addressed only the Veteran's alleged stressor of having undergone hostile fire, and not his claim of having witnessed the aftermath of the hanging of Korean civilians.  As such, an attempt to verify both stressors must be requested on remand.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Board notes that there has been some confusion regarding where the Veteran claimed to have been exposed to hostile fire during service.  It appears that the AOJ initially interpreted the aforementioned VA physician's reference to \"the border\" to be a claim that the hostile fire took place on the DMZ.  The record shows, however, that the Veteran later clarified that the \"border\" referred to was the perimeter of Kunsan AB, which he was assigned to patrol.  As such, the location where the claimed hostile fire took place must be made clear to JSRRC in the verification request made pursuant to this remand. \r\n\r\nOn remand, relevant ongoing medical records should be obtained.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(c) (West 2014); see also Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992) (VA medical records are in constructive possession of the agency, and must be obtained if the material could be determinative of the claim).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this case is REMANDED to the RO or the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, D.C., for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO or the AMC must send an additional request to JSRRC in order for an attempt to be made to verify the following in-service stressors claimed by the Veteran:\r\n\r\na) exposure to hostile fire from \"slicky boys,\" or thieves, while assigned to patrol Kunsan AB in Korea as an air policeman with the 6175th Support Squadron from August 24, 1959, to February 4, 1960;\r\n\r\nb) witnessing the aftermath of the hanging of Korean civilians by a local gang when he was assigned to secure the crime scene, at some time from August 4, 1959, to February 4, 1960.\r\n\r\nThe RO or the AMC must attach copies of the Veteran's DD Form 214, his service personnel records, as well as all of his statements related to his stressors, not simply paraphrased descriptions.\r\n\r\nIf JSRRC is unable to provide information of the type requested, the RO or the AMC must request JSRRC to identify any alternate agency or department that may provide verification of the alleged incidents.\r\n\r\n2.  The RO or the AMC should also undertake any other development it determines to be warranted.\r\n\r\n3.  Then, the RO or the AMC should readjudicate the issue on appeal.  If the benefit sought on appeal is not granted to the Veteran's satisfaction, the Veteran and his representative should be furnished an appropriate supplemental statement of the case and be afforded the requisite opportunity to respond.  Thereafter, the case should be returned to the Board for further appellate action.\r\n\r\nBy this remand, the Board intimates no opinion as to any final outcome warranted.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran need take no action until he is otherwise notified, but he may furnish additional evidence and/or argument during the appropriate time frame.  See Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis REMAND must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board or the Court for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West 2014).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nShane A.

Stephen Eckerman, Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active service from August 1986 to May 1988. \r\n\r\nThis appeal comes to the Board of Veterans Appeals  (Board) arises from an October 2012 rating action by the Regional Office (RO) in St. Paul, Minnesota, which denied a claim for service connection for \"an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include, but not limited to depression and anxiety.\"\r\n\r\nTo avoid any prejudice to the Veteran, the Board has recharacterized the issue broadly, as stated on the cover page of this decision.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009); Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 86-87 (2009).\r\n\r\nIn May 2015, the Veteran was afforded a video conference hearing before John J. Crowley, who is the Veterans Law Judge rendering the determination in this claim and was designated by the Chairman of the Board to conduct that hearing, pursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. � 7102(b) (West 2014 & Supp. 2015).\r\n\r\nThis appeal was processed using the VBMS and Virtual VA paperless claims processing system. Accordingly, any future consideration of this appellant's case should take into consideration the existence of this electronic record.\r\n\r\nThe issues of entitlement to an increased rating for service-connected traumatic brain injury, and entitlement to a total rating on the basis of individual unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU), have been raised by the record in a March 2016 statement, but have not been adjudicated by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  Therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction over them, and they are referred to the AOJ for appropriate action.  38 C.F.R. � 19.9(b) (2015).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran does not have an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, due to his service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nAn acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, was not incurred in, or as a result of, service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131, 5107 (West 2014 & Sup. 2015); 38 C.F.R.  �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304(f) (2015).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran asserts that he has an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, due to his service.  In oral and written testimony, he has reported experiencing a number of stressors during his service, to include a death of a soldier who got caught between two tanks during a training exercise, bomb threats made on his base in Germany, and duty on the border with East Germany that was stressful.  See e.g., Veteran's March 2013 stressor statement; transcript of Veteran's hearing, held in May 2015.  \r\n\r\nThe Board initially notes that service connection is currently in effect for disabilities that include a traumatic brain injury.\r\n\r\nAlthough additional medical evidence has been associated with the claims file since the most recent supplemental statement of the case, dated in February 2015, a waiver of RO review has been received in July 2016.  38 C.F.R. � 20.1304  (2015).\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  Service connection may also be granted on the basis of a post-service initial diagnosis of a disease, where the physician relates the current condition to the period of service.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).  In such instances, a grant of service connection is warranted only when, \"all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred during service.\"  Id.  \r\n\r\nIn order to establish service connection for PTSD, the evidence of record must include a medical diagnosis of the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. \r\n � 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nThe regulations governing PTSD were amended, effective July 13, 2010.  75 Fed. Reg. 39843 - 52 (July 13, 2010).  Specifically, this amendment eliminates the requirement for corroborating that the claimed in-service stressor occurred if a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to his/her fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the veteran's service.  Id.  In this case, as discussed infra, the Veteran is not shown to have service involving a fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.  \r\n\r\nEffective August 4, 2014, VA amended the portion of its Schedule for Rating Disabilities that addressed mental disorders to remove outdated references to the DSM and to replace them with references to the recently updated DSM-5.  The provisions of the interim final rule applied to all applications for benefits that are received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after August 4, 2014.  The Secretary did not intend for the provisions of the interim final rule to apply to claims that had been already certified for appeal to the Board, or that were pending before the Board, the Court, or the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 45,093 - 45,094 (Aug. 4, 2014).  In this case, the new provision is not for application, as the claim was adjudicated by the RO in October 2012.\r\n\r\nWhere the claimed stressor does not involve participation in combat and did not take place in a war zone, as in this case, there must be independent evidence to corroborate the Veteran's statement as to the occurrence of the claimed stressor.  Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, 288-89 (1994).  A veteran 's testimony, by itself, cannot, as a matter of law, establish the occurrence of a non-combat stressor.  Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 166 (1996).  Moreover, a medical opinion diagnosing PTSD does not suffice to verify the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressors.  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 142 (1997); Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395-396 (1996).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's personnel files show that his military occupation specialty was tracked vehicle repairman.  He spent 11 months in Germany.  \r\n\r\nIn July 2013, the RO issued a memorandum in which it concluded that there was insufficient evidence of record to warrant an attempt to verify any claimed stressor with the JSRRC (the U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center).  \r\n\r\nThe RO noted that March and June of 2013, it had requested additional details of the claimed stressors from the Veteran, but that no response had been received.  The Board further notes that this memorandum notes service in Vietnam between 1967 and 1968, and that this appears to be an editing error by the RO, as the Veteran is not shown to have served during this time period.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records do not show any relevant treatment, complaints, or diagnoses; a separation examination report is not of record.  The Veteran himself has never indicated treatment for this problem during service.\r\n\r\nAs for the post-service medical evidence, it includes VA progress notes, which show that as of 2011, the Veteran was diagnosed with disorders that include an anxiety disorder, and a major depressive disorder/depression NOS (not otherwise specified).  This evidence contains a few notations of \"possible PTSD,\" and \"features of PTSD.\"  \r\n\r\nA VA PTSD disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ), dated in May 2013, shows that the examiner, a psychologist (Dr. Y), stated that the Veteran's claims file had been reviewed.  The Veteran reported that, \"the whole border thing bothered me.\"  He had difficulty thinking of a specific stressor, but ultimately stated that \"there was a guy who was run over by an APC (armored personnel carrier) at the training grounds in Germany,\" and that he was 50 feet away.  He said that he helped provide first aid for the injured soldier, who he did not know.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's report was somewhat different from his stressor statement, in which he reported witnessing seeing a soldier who had been pinned between two tanks.  The report shows that the examiner concluded that it is less likely as not that the Veteran has PTSD that conforms to DSM-IV criteria.  The report notes the following: the Veteran had trouble identifying a stressor.  For a significant period of time he identified one stressor that was different from what he had previously claimed in his stressor statement.  He was quick to claim problems, but often could not provide credible descriptions of the symptoms.  He claimed to have daily intrusive memories, but not of any specific event.  He claimed to have recurrent nightmares several times a week, but was not clear about the content of the dreams.  Thus, it was questionable that the dreams were related to his reported stressor.  He claimed to have near-dissociative flashbacks a few times a week, lasting 10 to 15 minutes at a time, in which he thought that he was in Germany, and to have near-daily triggered memories causing intense emotional distress.  He identified helicopters as a trigger, but could not explain how it related to his claimed stressor.  Additionally, he was not clear about what memories were being triggered, saying, \"All of it.\"  He was very general in his claims and despite claiming rather severe levels of distress, he was observed to be quite calm throughout the interview.  \r\n\r\nThese observations, combined with his MMPI-2 (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory) profile that was invalid due to over-reporting of items rendered his self-report non-credible.  As such, an opinion could not be offered without resorting to mere speculation.  There was no Axis I diagnosis.  \r\n\r\nThe RO subsequently noted that the Veteran had provided additional details of his claimed stressors, and that additional medical evidence had been received since the May 2013 VA PTSD DBQ, and requested another opinion.  \r\n\r\nA VA PTSD DBQ, dated in September 2014, shows that a psychologist (Dr. K), stated that the Veteran reported that his service in Germany was \"very tense,\" and that he had served near the Fulda Gap, which would have been a key strategic point in any fighting with the Soviet Union.  He also reported seeing a man who was run over by a tracked vehicle, and providing medical care until the man could be evacuated.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's validity indices for his MMPI-2-RD test suggested that the Veteran's self-report was significantly over-inclusive of distress, specifically, he endorsed a far above-average number of rarely-endorsed items.  His profile was found to be consistent with exaggeration of distress to such a degree as to render the remainder of the testing invalid and impossible to interpret.  The examiner stated that the Veteran's self-report was considered to be unreliable and non-credible in the context of the current evaluation.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran does not have a mental disorder that conforms with DSM-5 criteria.  There was no Axis I diagnosis; the examiner explained that he was unable to provide a diagnosis due to unreliable self-report.  \r\n\r\nThe May 2013 and September 2014 VA DBQs show that the examiners determined that the Veteran's self-reports were not credible.  See also May 2012 VA neuropsychological evaluation (noting \"inconsistent and indiscriminate responding\" to testing).  The Board therefore finds that the Veteran is not an accurate historian.  See Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 16, 19-20 (1991); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995).  \r\n\r\nTo the extent that the claim includes a claim for PTSD, the Board finds that this condition is not shown.  See Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (under 38 U.S.C.A. � 1131, an appellant must submit proof of a presently existing disability resulting from service in order to merit an award of compensation).  Notwithstanding the notations in VA progress notes of \"possible PTSD,\" or features of PTSD,\" which are equivocal by their terms, there is no competent evidence to show that the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD.  The May 2013 and September 2014 VA examiners both specifically concluded that a PTSD diagnosis could not be provided, because the Veteran's self-reports were non-credible.  These opinions are considered highly probative, as the examiners summarized the Veteran's relevant service treatment records and post-service medical history, and as the opinions are accompanied by a sufficient explanation and findings.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000); Neives-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); see also Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382, 290 (2010) (holding that in order to rely upon an examiner's conclusion that an etiological opinion would be speculative, the examiner must explain the basis for such an opinion or the basis must otherwise be apparent in the review of the evidence).  Accordingly, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim that the Veteran has PTSD due to his service, and that the claim must be denied.  Gilpin.  Simply stated, the best evidence provides evidence against this claim.  \r\n\r\nTo the extent that he has presented a claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD, the Veteran is not shown to have received any relevant treatment during service.  Therefore, a chronic condition is not shown during service.  See 38 C.F.R.  � 3.303(a), (b).  The Veteran has been diagnosed with disorders involving anxiety and depression, however, the earliest medical evidence to show the existence of an acquired psychiatric disorder is dated in 2011, many years following separation from service.  There is no competent opinion of record in support of the claim.  In this regard, two VA examiners concluded that they could not provide either a diagnosis or an etiological opinion because the Veteran's self-reports were unreliable.  The duty to assist a claimant is not a one-way street, and the claim must accordingly be decided based upon the evidence of record.  Olsen v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 480 (1992) (the duty to assist a claimant is not a one-way street, and the claim must accordingly be decided based upon the evidence of record); Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 406 (1991); see also Kowalski v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 171, 178 (2005) (the claimant is obligated to cooperate in the development of evidence, and failure to do so puts him at risk of an adverse adjudication based on an incomplete and underdeveloped record).  These opinions are considered highly probative on the issue of whether or not there is a basis to provide an etiological opinion, as the examiners summarized the Veteran's relevant service treatment records and post-service medical history, and as the opinions are accompanied by sufficient explanations and findings.  Prejean; Neives-Rodriguez; Jones.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, and that the claim must be denied.  \r\n\r\nWith regard to the appellant's own contentions, although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, see Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011), as to the specific issues in this case (the cause of the Veteran's problem, not the problem itself) they fall outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  In this regard, the Veteran is claiming service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, and this is not the type of condition that is readily amenable to mere lay diagnosis or probative comment regarding its etiology.  Jandreau; Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007).  The issue on appeal is based on the contention that an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is related to the Veteran's service.  The Veteran's service treatment reports and post-service medical records have been discussed.  Two VA examiners have concluded that a diagnosis and an etiological opinion cannot be provided due to unreliable self-reports.  Given the foregoing, the Board finds that the medical evidence outweighs the appellant's contentions to the effect that he has the claimed condition due to his service.  Madden v. Gober, 125 F. 3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  \r\n\r\nThe Board has considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, as is stated above, the preponderance of the evidence is against the appellant's claim, and the doctrine is not for application.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\nDuties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThere is no indication in this record of a failure to notify.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3rd 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2015).\r\n\r\nPursuant to the duty to assist, VA must obtain \"records of relevant medical treatment or examination\" at VA facilities.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(c)(2).  All records pertaining to the condition at issue are presumptively relevant.  See Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  \r\n\r\nIn addition, where the Veteran \"sufficiently identifies\" other VA medical records that he or she desires to be obtained, VA must also seek those records even if they do not appear potentially relevant based upon the available information.  Sullivan v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 786, 793 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (citing 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(3)).  In this case, the Veteran has not indicated that such records exist, and all pertinent records have been obtained.  The Veteran has been afforded an examination, he has been determined to not have PTSD, and two VA examiners have concluded that an etiological opinion cannot be provided due to unreliable self-reporting.  To the extent that the September 2014 VA examiner indicated that the criteria for PTSD had not been met under DSM-5 (as opposed to DSM-IV), given the lack of a verified stressor, and the examiner's ultimate conclusion that he was unable to provide an etiological opinion due to unreliable self-reporting, this can be no more than harmless error.  See Conway v. Principi, 353 F.3d 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran has not been prejudiced by a failure of VA in its duty to assist, and that any violation of the duty to assist could be no more than harmless error.  Id.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nJOHN J.

Krunic, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from February 1973 to June 1981.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2011 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Roanoke, Virginia.  Jurisdiction was subsequently transferred to the RO in Louisville, Kentucky.   \r\n\r\nThe issue on appeal was originally adjudicated by the RO as entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  The Board has recharacterized the claim to consider a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, to more accurately reflect the nature of the claim.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5-6  (2009).\r\n\r\nA hearing was also held before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge at the Central Office in Washington, D.C., in June 2016.  A transcript of the Board hearing is of record.  The undersigned Veterans Law Judge held the record open for a 60-day period following the hearing to allow for the submission of additional evidence; however, the Veteran and his representative did not submit any additional evidence thereafter.\r\n\r\nThis appeal was processed using the Virtual VA and Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) paperless claims processing system.  Accordingly, any future consideration of this Veteran's case should take into account the existence of this electronic record.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the Veteran if further action is required.\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that remand is required to obtain a VA examination and afford the Veteran an additional opportunity to submit stressor details. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has asserted that he has PTSD that is related to multiple in-service stressors.  During his Board hearing, the Veteran testified that in approximately October or November 1975 while stationed in Japan, his master gunnery sergeant, whom he had befriended, was killed in a motorcycle accident.  See Board hearing transcript at 6-8.  The Veteran also testified that he slipped and hit his head against a forklift and injured his head and neck.  See Board hearing transcript at 11.  The Veteran further testified that during boot camp, between February and May 1972, his weapon was found to be unsecured.  Subsequently, he was punished by having his weapon confiscated and was dragged through mud with a belt around his neck and beaten during a motivation camp following the incident.  See Board hearing transcript at 12-14.  On remand the Veteran should be afforded an additional opportunity to submit stressor information in support of his claim and the RO should attempt to verify the Veteran's asserted in-service stressors.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Board notes that the Veteran has not been provided a VA examination in connection with his claim for PTSD.  Although the Veteran was afforded a VA mental disorders examination (other than PTSD) in June 2014, the examination was in connection with his claim for service connection for residuals of traumatic brain injury.  Furthermore, despite VA treatment records indicating that the Veteran is diagnosed with multiple psychiatric diagnoses, including PTSD, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran as having a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury only.  Under these circumstances, the Board finds that a VA examination and a medical opinion are needed to determine the nature and etiology of any current psychiatric disorder that may be present, to include PTSD.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81  (2006); see also 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(d)(2) (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(4) (2015).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1. The AOJ should request that the Veteran provide the names and addresses of any and all health care providers who have provided treatment for any psychiatric disorders, to include PTSD.  After acquiring this information and obtaining any necessary authorization, the AOJ should obtain and associate these records with the claims file.\r\n\r\nThe AOJ should also secure any outstanding VA treatment records, including any records from the Hampton VA Medical Center.\r\n\r\n2.  Send the Veteran a VA Form 21-0781 (statement in support of claim for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) and request that he provide the specific details about the claimed stressors associated with his PTSD.   \r\n\r\n3. Upon receipt of the aforementioned VA Form 21-0781 (or other appropriate PTSD development letter), or after a reasonable amount of time has passed without response, if it is determined that sufficient details have been provided so as to warrant an attempt to verify the Veteran's stressors, attempt to verify the in-service stressor(s) through the U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) and/or other appropriate source(s), following the procedures set forth in 38 C.F.R. � 3.159.  \r\n\r\n4.  After completing the foregoing development, provide the Veteran with a VA examination to determine the etiology of any current psychiatric disorder that may be present, to include PTSD.  The examiner must elicit from the Veteran a history of his psychiatric symptoms, to include whether he experienced any symptoms during service.  The examiner must review all pertinent records associated with the claims file, including the Veteran's service treatment records, post-service medical records, and lay statements, and it should be confirmed that such records were available for review.  An explanation for all opinions expressed must be provided.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran is competent to attest to observable symptomatology.  If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner should provide a fully reasoned explanation.\r\n\r\nThe examiner must identify all current psychiatric disorders.  If any previously diagnosed disorder is no longer present, the examiner must provide an explanation.\r\n\r\nFor each disorder identified other than PTSD, the examiner must state whether it is at least as likely as not (a 50 percent or greater probability) that the disorder manifested in or is otherwise related to the Veteran's military service, including as a result of his reported in-service stressors. \r\n\r\nWith respect to PTSD, the AOJ must provide the examiner with a summary of any verified in-service stressors and instruct the examiner that only these events and any stressors related to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity may be considered for the purpose of determining whether exposure to an in-service stressor has resulted in PTSD.  The examiner should first determine whether the diagnostic criteria to support the diagnosis of PTSD have been satisfied.  If the PTSD diagnosis is deemed appropriate, the examiner must comment on the link between the current symptomatology and any verified in-service stressor and the fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Veteran is service-connected for residuals of traumatic brain injury.  The examiner should state whether any psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is caused by or aggravated by his service-connected disability. \r\n\r\n(The term \"at least as likely as not\" does not mean within the realm of medical possibility, but rather that the medical evidence both for and against a conclusion is so evenly divided that it is as medically sound to find favor of conclusion as it is to find against it).\r\n\r\nA clear rationale for all opinions would be helpful, and a discussion of the facts and medical principles involved would be of considerable assistance to the Board.  \r\n\r\n5.  When the development requested has been completed, the case should be reviewed by the AOJ on the basis of additional evidence received.  If the benefits sought are not granted, the Veteran and his representative should be furnished a supplemental statement of the case and be afforded a reasonable opportunity to respond before the record is returned to the Board for further review.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West 2014).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nANTHONY C.

Leifert, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the Army from February 1968 to April 1970. \r\n\r\nThis appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) arose from a December 2007 rating decision in which the RO, inter alia, denied service connection for PTSD.  The Veteran filed a notice of disagreement (NOD) in November 2008.  In July 2009, the RO issued a statement of the case (SOC), and the Veteran filed a substantive appeal (via a VA Form 9, Appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals ) in August 2009.\r\n\r\nIn May 2016, the Veteran testified during a Board hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) at the Las Vegas satellite office of the Reno RO; a transcript of that hearing is of record.\r\n\r\nWith respect to characterization of the claim on appeal, the Board notes that, while the Veteran's claim has only been adjudicated as one for service connection for PTSD, given the various diagnoses of acquired psychiatric disorders of record, including PTSD and depression, not otherwise specified (NOS), the issue has been expanded and re-characterized, as reflected on the title page,.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record).\r\n\r\nThis appeal is now being processed utilizing the paperless, electronic Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) and Virtual VA claims processing systems. \r\n\r\nFor reasons expressed below, the matter on appeal is being remanded to the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). VA will notify the Veteran when further action, on his part, is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Board's review of the claims file reveals that further AOJ action in this appeal is warranted.  Specifically, there appear to be pertinent medical records outstanding.\r\n\r\nDuring his May 2016 Board hearing,  the Veteran testified that he has been attending two different group therapy sessions, one every other Tuesday in Kingsman, Arizona, and another in Las Vegas.  He is seen by his social worker M.A. and Dr. B.  The claims file currently includes VA treatment records from the Prescott VA Medical Center (VAMC), dated from June 2000 through March 2014; and from the Las Vegas VAMC dated from March 2011 through April 2016.  Thus, outstanding mental health records-to  include Prescott VAMC records dated since March 2014 , and Las Vegas VAMC records dated since April 2016-likely exist.  The Board emphasizes that records generated by VA facilities that may have an impact on the adjudication of a claim are considered constructively in the possession of VA adjudicators during the consideration of a claim, regardless of whether those records are physically on file.  See Dunn v. West, 11 Vet. App. 462 (1998); Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992).  Hence, the AOJ should obtain  all outstanding, pertinent records of mental evaluation and/or treatment of the Veteran, following the procedures prescribed in 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c) as regards requests for records from Federal facilities.\r\n\r\nThe AOJ should also give the Veteran another opportunity to provide additional information and/or evidence pertinent to the claim on appeal ,explaining that he has a full one-year period to respond.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(b)(1) (West 2014); but see also 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(b)(3) (clarifying that VA may make a decision on a claim before the expiration of the one-year notice period).  In its letter, the AOJ should specifically request that the Veteran provide, or provide appropriate authorization to obtain, any outstanding, pertinent private (non-VA) records. \r\n\r\nThereafter, the AOJ should obtain any additional evidence for which the Veteran provides sufficient information and, if necessary, authorization, following the procedures prescribed in 38 C.F.R. � 3.159 (2015).\r\n\r\nThe actions identified herein are consistent with the duties imposed by the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA). See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5103, 5103A (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159 (2015).  However, identification of specific actions requested on remand does not relieve the AOJ of the responsibility to ensure full VCAA compliance.  Hence, in addition to the actions requested above, the AOJ should also undertake any other development or notification action deemed warranted (to include arranging for further examination of the Veteran, or obtaining further medical opinion, if appropriate) prior to adjudicating the claim on appeal.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, this matter is hereby REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Obtain all outstanding records of VA mental health evaluation and/or treatment of the Veteran-to include records from the Prescott and Las Vegas VAMCs (and any associated facility(ies)) dated since March 2014 and April 2016, respectively.  Follow the procedures of 38 C.F.R. � 3.159 (2015) as regards requesting records from Federal facilities.  All records and/or responses should be associated with the claims file. \r\n \r\n2.  Send to the Veteran and his representative a letter requesting that the Veteran provide sufficient information, and if necessary, authorization to obtain any additional evidence pertinent to the claims on appeal that is not currently of record.  Specifically request that the Veteran furnish, or furnish appropriate authorization to obtain, all outstanding, pertinent private (non-VA) records.\r\n\r\nClearly explain to the Veteran that he has a full one-year period to respond (although VA may decide the claim within the one-year period).\r\n \r\n3.  If the Veteran responds, assist him in obtaining any additional evidence identified, following the current procedures set forth in 38 C.F.R. � 3.159.  All records/responses received should be associated with the claims file.  If any records sought are not obtained, notify the Veteran of the records that were not obtained, explain the efforts taken to obtain them, and describe further action to be taken.\r\n \r\n4.  To help avoid future remand, ensure that all requested actions have been accomplished (to the extent possible) in compliance with this REMAND.  If any action is not undertaken, or is taken in a deficient manner, appropriate corrective action should be undertaken.  Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).\r\n\r\n5.  After completing the requested actions, and any additional notification and/or development deemed warranted (to include arranging for further medical examination of the Veteran or obtaining further medical opinion, if appropriate), adjudicate the claim on appeal in light of all pertinent evidence (to include all evidence added to the VBMS and/or Virtual VA file(s) since the last adjudication) and legal authority.\r\n \r\n6.   If the benefit sought on appeal remains denied, furnish the Veteran and his representative an appropriate supplemental SOC that includes clear reasons and bases for all determinations, and afford them the appropriate time period for response.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this REMAND is to afford due process and to accomplish additional development and adjudication; it is not the Board's intent to imply whether the benefits requested should be granted or denied.  The Veteran need take no action until otherwise notified, but he may furnish additional evidence and/or argument during the appropriate time frame.  See Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals  or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Kardian, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1966 to April 1969, with service in Vietnam.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2006 rating decision, of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe Board remanded the issues on appeal for additional development in May 2015. The directives having been substantially complied with, VA treatment records associated with the claims file, and the Veteran provided an adequate VA opinion, the matter again is before the Board. See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998).\r\n\r\nThe Board has reviewed the electronic records maintained in Virtual VA and Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) to ensure consideration of the totality of the evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1. The Veteran had active service in the Republic of Vietnam from September 1967 to March 1969, and is presumed to have been exposed to herbicides.\r\n\r\n2. The Veteran's hypertension has been shown to be etiologically related to his active service to include as due to herbicide exposure. \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for hypertension, to include as due to herbicide exposure, have been met. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1110, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.307, 3.309 (2015).\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI. Duties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nVA has met all statutory and regulatory notice and duty to assist provisions with respect to the Veteran's claims. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2015).  In light of the fully favorable decision herein, no further discussion of compliance with VA's duty to notify and assist is necessary. Mlechick v. Mansfield, 503 F.3d 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2007). \r\nII. Service Connection\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: \"(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service\" - the so-called \"nexus\" requirement. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  \r\n\r\nFor secondary service connection, any disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury shall be service connected. 38 C.F.R. � 3.310. Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. � 3.310 (a); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).\r\n\r\nIn addition to these provisions, the law provides that diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents used in support of military operations in the Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) during the Vietnam era will be considered to have been incurred in-service. 38 U.S.C.A. � 1116(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. � 3.307(a)(6).  A Veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era, and has a disease listed at 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(e), shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent containing dioxin, such as Agent Orange, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the Veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service. 38 C.F.R. � 3.307(a)(6)(iii). Furthermore, even if a veteran does not have a disease listed at 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(e), he or she is presumed to have been exposed to herbicides if he or she served in Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the Veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service. 38 U.S.C.A. � 1116(f).\r\n\r\nIf a Veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active service, the following diseases shall be service-connected if the requirements of 38 C.F.R. � 3.307(a)(6) are met, even though there is no record of such disease during service, provided further that the rebuttable presumption provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 3.307(d) are also satisfied: Chloracne or other acneform disease consistent with chloracne; Type 2 diabetes (also known as Type II diabetes mellitus or adult-onset diabetes); Hodgkin's disease; chronic lymphocytic leukemia; B cell leukemia, Parkinson's disease, multiple myeloma; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; early onset peripheral neuropathy; porphyria cutanea tarda; prostate cancer; respiratory cancers (cancer of the lung, bronchus, larynx or trachea); soft-tissue sarcoma (other than osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, or mesothelioma); and ischemic heart disease, (including, but not limited to, acute, subacute, and old myocardial infarction; atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease including coronary artery disease (including coronary spasm) and coronary bypass surgery; and stable, unstable and Prinzmetal's angina).\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the Veteran has a diagnosis of hypertension, and the service personnel records show that the Veteran served in Vietnam and is presumed to have been exposed to herbicides during this time. See 38 C.F.R. � 3.307(a)(6)(iii).  Further, the Board notes that the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Institute of Medicine's Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 2010 (2010 Update) concluded that there is \"limited or suggestive\" evidence of an association between exposure to Agent Orange and hypertension.  See Nat'l Acad. of Sci., Inst. of Med., Veterans & Agent Orange: Update 2010 (2011) at 694.  The Secretary discussed the 2006, 2008, and 2010 Updates, which contain the same analysis with respect to hypertension, in the Federal Register. See e.g. 77 Fed. Reg. 47,924 -01 (Aug. 10, 2012) (noting \"[i]n Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 2006 . . . and Update 2008, NAS elevated hypertension to the 'Limited or Suggestive Evidence' category\"); 75 Fed. Reg. 32,540, 32,549 (June 8, 2010) (\"In Update 2006, NAS concluded that there was 'limited or suggestive evidence of an association between exposure to the compounds of interest and hypertension.'\"); 75 Fed. Reg. 81,332, 81,333 (NAS, in 2008, categorized certain health outcomes, including hypertension, to have \"'limited or suggestive evidence of an association.' This category is defined to mean that evidence suggests an association between exposure to herbicides and the outcome, but a firm conclusion is limited because chance, bias, and confounding could not be ruled out with confidence.\"). \r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that when a claimed disorder is not included as a presumptive disorder, direct service connection may nevertheless be established by demonstrating that the disease was in fact \"incurred\" during service by proof of direct causation.  See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1042 (Fed Cir. 1994).\r\n\r\nUnder applicable criteria, VA shall consider all lay and medical evidence of record in a case with respect to benefits under laws administered by VA. In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  \r\n\r\nIII. Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends he is entitled to service connection for hypertension, as a result of herbicide exposure, and to include as secondary to service-connected PTSD, and diabetes mellitus type II. The Board finds the evidence of record supports that there is a causal connection between the Veteran's active service to include his presumed herbicide exposure and current hypertension. As a result the Board finds that service connection is warranted on a direct basis. \r\n\r\nFirst, service connection requires evidence of a current disability. The evidence of record shows the Veteran has a diagnosis of hypertension. See September 2013 VA examination. Further, VA treatment records note ongoing treatment for the Veterans' hypertension. Therefore, the first element of service connection, a current disability, has been met.\r\n\r\nNext, turning to the second element of service connection there must be evidence of an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury. The Veteran's DD 214 and personnel records indicate he had one year and seven months of foreign service, and that he was stationed in Vietnam from September 1967 to April 1969. Based on this evidence, the Board finds the Veteran served in the Republic of Vietnam, during an applicable presumptive period, and is therefore presumed to have been exposed to herbicides. 38 C.F.R. � 3.307(a)(6)(iii).  Therefore, an in-service event, injury or disease has been shown. \r\n\r\nTurning to the third element of service connection, the evidence of record shows a causal connection between the Veteran's hypertension and his active service, to include herbicide exposure. The Veteran has consistently reported that while on active service in Vietnam working as an auto repairman he was exposed to herbicides and his hypertension is a result of such exposure. In addition, the Veteran  has reported that his hypertension is caused by his service-connected PTSD and/or diabetes mellitus type II. The Board finds the Veteran's report of exposure to herbicides in-service is credible and consistent with the terms of his service.  \r\n\r\nNext turning to the medical evidence, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in September 2013 and VA obtained supplemental opinions in June 2015 and September 2015.  In the September 2013 VA examination the examiner diagnosed the Veteran with hypertension and opined that his hypertension was not secondary to his diabetes mellitus type II, PTSD or medications prescribed for PTSD. See September 2013 VA examination. This opinion was inadequate, because, the examiner failed to consider whether the Veteran's hypertension was aggravated by his diabetes mellitus type II and/or PTSD, or if his hypertension was otherwise due to his active service, to include herbicide exposure. As a result, this examination was inadequate. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the May 2015 Board remand, the Veteran was afforded supplemental VA opinions. June 2015 and September 2015 VA opinions found the Veteran's hypertension was not a result of his active service to include herbicide exposure, and had not been caused or aggravated by his service-connected diabetes mellitus type II and/or PTSD. See June 2015 and September 2015 VA opinions. As to herbicide exposure, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran's remote history of herbicide exposure during service was less likely to be a cause of his hypertension, attributing the Veteran's hypertension to obesity, sleep apnea and a long history of smoking. See June 2015 VA opinion. As to PTSD, the examiner noted an opinion could not be given without resorting to speculation, potentially attributing the Veteran's PTSD to obesity, sleep apnea, a long history of smoking, lifestyle and genetic factors. See September 2015 VA opinion.  However, both the June 2015 and September 2015 opinions were inadequate. The September 2015 opinion was inadequate as it failed to address the Veteran's claims that his obesity is a result of his sleep impairment, which is a symptom of his PTSD, and failed to address medical literature provided by the Veteran's representative suggesting a connection between hypertension and PTSD and diabetes mellitus type II. Finally, the June 2015 opinion was inadequate as it failed to address medical literature provided by the Veteran's representative, suggesting a connection between herbicide exposure and hypertension. \r\n\r\nBased on the inadequacies of the medical record, the Board sought a VA specialist opinion in March 2016. The specialist noted a review of medical literature including medical literature provided by the Veteran's representative and the Veteran's claims file. The specialist found that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's currently diagnosed hypertension is related to his exposure to herbicides. See May 17, 2016 opinion. The specialist opined that based on a review of the medical literature particularly studies from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Institute of Medicine which performed adjustments for many potential confounding variables known to cause hypertension, found an association between herbicides and hypertension. The specialist noted that while the Veteran has risk factors associated with the development of hypertension, including obesity, chronic tobacco use and diabetes mellitus type II this significant medical literature suggests it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's hypertension is related to his herbicide exposure. \r\n\r\nFurther, the opinion from the VA specialist noted that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's hypertension was caused by his service-connected diabetes mellitus type II. The specialist cited two pieces of medical literature which found that those with insulin sensitivity may be predisposed to hypertension, however insulin sensitivity was not associated with blood pressure progression or hypertension in obese participants, and thus association cannot be extrapolated to the Veteran. A further literature review failed to find a clear link between diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension. \r\n\r\nFinally, regarding the Veteran's PTSD, the VA specialist found that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's hypertension was caused by his service-connected PTSD. The examiner noted that a review of the medical literature did not show that individuals with PTSD have been reported to be more likely to be diagnosed with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. However, the specialist noted that this literature is not abundant, and more research is needed in this field to show a stronger potential relationship between PTSD and hypertension. The specialist noted that as to whether or not the Veteran's hypertension has been aggravated (permanently worsened beyond its natural progression) by his diabetes mellitus type II and/or PTSD, research has suggested that insulin adversely affects blood pressure, however this research was not conclusive and additional research is needed to support aggravation between hypertension and diabetes mellitus type II. As to PTSD, the VA specialist noted PTSD causes neuro hormonal changes due to hypervigilance and aggressive behaviors which could potentially worsen the negative effect of hypertension on the heart, but such is speculative.  \r\n\r\nThe VA examination in September 2013 and VA opinions from June 2015 and September 2015 are inadequate, and as such are not entitled to probative weight. As a result the Board finds that the VA specialist opinion from May 2016 is most probative.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Board has competent and credible testimony from the Veteran regarding his exposure to herbicides in-service and a positive probative opinion from a specialist providing a causal connection between the Veteran's hypertension and his active service. Therefore, the Board finds that service connection for hypertension is warranted. 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for hypertension, as due to herbicide exposure is granted. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nBETHANY L.

Harter, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from September 2005 to November 2009.  He was awarded the Combat Action Badge and the Iraq Campaign Medal with Campaign Star, among other decorations.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2011 RO decision.  \r\n\r\nIn 2011, the Veteran executed a power of attorney form in favor of a private attorney.  However, in March 2016, the attorney moved to withdraw from representation of the Veteran, declaring that various factors make continued representation impractical or otherwise unethical.  The Board accepts this declaration as sufficient good cause to excuse the attorney from further representing the Veteran in this appeal.  The RO did notify the Veteran via an April 2016 letter that the attorney had withdrawn and provided him information as to how to appoint another representative, which he has not done.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's November 2011 notice of disagreement raises an additional claim for entitlement to a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities.  As service connection has not yet been granted for any disability, review of this claim is premature.  We simply note it here.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the Veteran when further action on his part is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe issues certified for appeal include entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability to include depression and substance abuse.  However, in June 2014, the Veteran filed a new claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  Governing case law requires that claims for mental health disabilities must be viewed in light of several factors including:  the claimant's description of the claim; the symptoms the claimant describes; and the information the claimant submits or that the Secretary obtains in support of the claim.  Reasonably, the Veteran did not file a claim to receive benefits only for a particular diagnosis, but for the affliction his mental condition, whatever that is, causes him.  Moreover, the regulation that defines a \"[s]ubstantially complete application\" says that an application should identify \"any medical condition(s) on which it [the claim] is based.\"  38 C.F.R. � 3.159(a)(3).  The inclusion of the plural \"condition(s)\" indicates that a single claim can encompass more than one condition.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009).  Therefore, upon remand, the RO should review the claim to include all mental health disabilities shown to be present.\r\n\r\nSince 2010, when the Veteran filed the claim which led to this appeal, he has used at least three different addresses.  A September 2010 form indicates that the Veteran was homeless at that time.  There are several indications in the file that the Veteran is not receiving his mail.  This is significant because up to this point, the RO has primarily corresponded with the Veteran through the mail system.\r\n\r\nOne piece of correspondence from the VA, a copy of the October 2013 Statement of the Case, was returned by the Postal Service.  A handwritten note indicates that the notice was resent with a new address; however the only other copy of this letter in the file bears the same address and it is unclear what the \"new address\" was considered to be.  \r\n\r\nIn July 2013 the Veteran failed to report for a scheduled VA examination.  The file, as is usual procedure, does not contain a copy of the notice letter, so we cannot tell where the notice was sent.  Under the circumstances, there is a possibility that he did not report for the examination because he did not receive the notification.  \r\n\r\nLikewise, the Veteran was scheduled for a Board hearing in August 2016.  He again failed to show for the hearing.  Again, it is entirely possible that he did not report for the hearing because he did not receive the notification.  VA has had no contact from him in over two years.\r\n\r\nSpecific procedures for contacting homeless veterans are set forth in 38 C.F.R. � 1.710.  For instance, correspondence may be delivered to the Agent Cashier of a VA Medical facility, if the Veteran attends that facility or is likely to attend that facility.  Upon remand, those procedures should be followed, unless it becomes apparent that the Veteran has obtained a fixed address and is reachable by the usual means.  The Veteran is again advised that he should always try to provide both the RO and the VAMC with a contact address, if possible, and keep it updated.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the Veteran receives regular VA medical care.  Review of his medical records reveals that he appears to be in regular contact with the VA social work service and his treating mental health care providers.  Several additional residences are reflected in the review of the Veteran's medical records, as his social workers' support team has assisted him in obtaining subsidized housing upon several occasions.  Another social work note reflects that the Veteran was under \"house arrest;\" apparently related to several different criminal legal situations.  We observe in passing that the Veteran's VA medical records have not been updated for his claims file in several years.  \r\n\r\nIn any case, the Veteran has requested a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge via videoconference and he is entitled to one under law.  As above, it is possible that he did not receive notice of the hearing scheduled for August 2016 and the Board is not satisfied that the RO's letter of notification was adequate under the circumstances.  Therefore, another attempt should be undertaken.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should initially simply contact the VA medical facilities where the Veteran receives care to ascertain whether they have a current address for him.  If not, then the complete process outlined in 38 C.F.R. � 1.710 should be followed for all correspondence pertaining to this appeal.  \r\n\r\n2.  The RO should schedule a videoconference hearing, following all indicated procedures to notify the Veteran and his representative, should he choose to appoint one, of the scheduled date and time. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

His decorations include the Combat Infantryman Badge, Vietnam Service Medal with Bronze Service Star, Vietnam Campaign Medal with 60 Device, and Bronze Star Medal with \"V\" Device.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veteran's Appeals (Board) from a June 2011 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Newington, Connecticut.  The jurisdiction has since been transferred to the RO in Detroit, Michigan.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD has been recharacterized to include all psychiatric disorders reasonably raised by the record.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).\r\n\r\nThis matter was previously before the Board in November 2015, at which time it was remanded to schedule the Veteran's hearing request.  In August 2016, the Veteran and his spouse testified at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ).  A transcript of the hearing is of record.\r\n\r\nIn a December 2013 claim, the Veteran requested secondary service connection for \"knee and back problems, neck problems, memory problems.\"  Further, the issues of reopening his claim for peripheral neuropathy, and entitlement to a compensable rating for his service-connected bilateral hearing loss, have been raised by the record.  See March 2014 VA Form 9.  Because the foregoing issues have not been adjudicated by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), the Board does not have jurisdiction over them and they are referred to the AOJ for appropriate action.  38 C.F.R. � 19.9(b) (2015). \r\n\r\nThis appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c) (2015).  38 U.S.C.A. � 7107(a)(2) (West 2014).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's PTSD and depressive disorder had its onset in service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as PTSD and depressive disorder, have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107(b) (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 4.125 (2015).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that his PTSD is related to his combat experiences in Vietnam.

Cir. 2004); see also 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nThe July 1968 separation examination report indicates that the Veteran reported having depression or excessive worry.  The record shows current diagnoses of depressive disorder and PTSD.  See, e.g., February 2016 VA treatment record.  Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran has experienced symptoms of recurrent distressing dreams of the traumatic event; intense psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event; efforts to avoid thoughts, feelings, or conversations associated with the trauma; efforts to avoid activities, places, or people that arouse recollections of the trauma; feeling of detachment or estrangement from others; difficulty falling or staying asleep; irritability or outbursts of anger; and difficulty concentrating.  See, e.g., April 2011 VA examination.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the Veteran's reported stressors are consistent with the places, types and circumstances of his service in Vietnam.  A VA therapist, from the VA PTSD Clinical Team, provided a July 2016 statement noting diagnoses of persistent depressive disorder and PTSD related to combat he experienced in Vietnam.  She also indicated that the Veteran has consistently reported that symptoms associated with PTSD and depressive disorder began during his service and have caused him significant dysfunction throughout his life.  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the medical evidence of record supports the finding that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms are related to his in-service stressors.  Consequently, the elements necessary to establish service connection for his psychiatric disorder have been met.  See 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304(f); see also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed PTSD and depressive disorder, is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nSTEVEN D.

Finn, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active duty service from June 1980 to September 1988.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2011 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Detroit, Michigan.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified at an April 2015 videoconference hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge, at the Detroit, Michigan, RO.  The transcript of the hearing has been included in the file.\r\n\r\nIn May 2015, the claim was remanded for further development.\r\n\r\nA review of the Virtual VA paperless claims processing system was conducted.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ.  VA will notify the Veteran if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran claims she suffers from an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD since service, but that she did not have a proper diagnosis in service.  The Veteran is currently diagnosed with major depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD.  \r\n\r\nSTRs showed complaints of chest pain in July of 1988 and she was diagnosed with anxiety.  The enlistment examination and separation records were negative for symptoms or a diagnosis of a mental disability.  An August 2009 VA treatment record reflects severe depression possibly attributed to military intelligence stress and dangerous situations.  \r\n\r\nWith regard to PTSD, she asserts that she suffers from PTSD, in part, from a sexual assault in service and from a fear of invasion of Russia into Poland while stationed in Berlin.  (See September 2009 Statement and October 2015 Written Statement).  Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(5), if a PTSD claim is based on in-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than the Veteran's service records may corroborate her account of the alleged stressor incident(s).  Examples of such evidence include, but are not limited to: records from law enforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (f)(5)(detailing that evidence of behavior changes following the claimed assault is one type of relevant evidence that may be found in these sources).  Because the Veteran has asserted that her claimed acquired psychiatric disorder may be the result of in-service personal assault(s), including military sexual trauma, she must be advised of the evidence that may constitute credible supporting evidence of in-service personal assault.  The Veteran should be provided notice on remand.\r\n\r\nA December 2010 VA examination, in part, the examiner opined that anxiety and major depression was less likely as not related to the in service experiences.  The examiner gave the rationale there was no clear contributing persistent stressor due to military service.  She was diagnosed with a personality disorder with malingering (exaggerated symptoms reported in context of disability examination), panic disorder with agoraphobia, major depressive disorder, and alcohol dependence in full remission.  (See also January 2011 addendum).  The examiner did not address the issue of PTSD.  In April 2015, the Veteran testified that she did not realize that she had mental health problems until she had a breakdown in 2001where she was hospitalized for two weeks and treated for panic attacks, severe depression, and anxiety.  (See Hearing Transcript, p. 4).  In light of her clarification and additional medical records associated with the claims file, the Veteran should be afforded another VA examination on remand.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  The RO or the AMC should undertake appropriate development to obtain any outstanding records, to include any more recent treatment records related to the claimed disabilities. \r\n\r\n2.  Send the Veteran a development letter for PTSD advising her of the need for credible supporting evidence for any claimed stressors that are not combat-related and notifying her that in-service personal assault and/or sexual trauma may be corroborated by evidence from sources other than service records.  Examples of such evidence, as listed in 38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (f) (5), should be provided.\r\n\r\n3.  After completing the development requested above, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate medical examiner to determine the nature and etiology of any psychiatric disorder(s).  The claims folder must be made available to the examiner.  All tests and studies deemed necessary by the examiner should be performed.  Based on a review of the claims folder and the clinical findings of the examination, the examiner must:\r\n\r\n(a) Identify whether the Veteran currently has PTSD under the diagnostic criteria, and if so, whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., a 50 percent or greater probability) that the disability is etiologically related to the Veteran's active military service, to include her service in Berlin, being in fear of hostile military activity, and/or military sexual trauma.  If specific stressors have been verified, the examiner should be advised of such stressors.\r\n\r\n(b) Identify whether the Veteran has any other acquired psychiatric disorder(s) under the diagnostic criteria, and if so, provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the disorder had its onset during, or is otherwise etiologically related to, the Veteran's active military service.\r\n\r\nIf the examiner does not identify any other acquired psychiatric disorder, the examiner should, to the extent possible, reconcile his or her findings with any contrary medical evidence of record, including VA treatment records documenting diagnoses of major depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD and the December 2010 VA examination.\r\n\r\n(c) If a personality disorder is diagnosed, the examiner is asked to opine as to whether it was subject to a superimposed disease or injury during service that resulted in additional disability, or whether it was otherwise permanently aggravated by the Veteran's active military service.\r\n\r\nThe examiner should discuss the Veteran's in-service diagnosis of anxiety and any unusual behavior.\r\n\r\nA complete rationale for all opinions should be set forth.  The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report her symptoms and history.  Such reports, including those of continuity of symptomatology, must be acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinion.  If the examiner rejects the Veteran's reports, the examiner must provide an explanation for such rejection.\r\n\r\nIf the examiner cannot provide an opinion, the examiner must confirm that all procurable and assembled data and information was fully considered, and he or she must provide a detailed explanation for why an opinion cannot be rendered.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Biggins, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from July 1969 to November 1971.  \r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from January 2009 and July 2009 rating decisions of the Chicago, Illinois, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge at a November 2012 Board videoconference hearing, a transcript of this hearing is of record. \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe more probative medical opinion shows that the Veteran's hypertension is likely caused by his service-connected PTSD and is likely etiologically related to his active service to include his exposure to herbicides. \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nService connection for hypertension is warranted.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2016).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  Legal Criteria \r\n\r\nEstablishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247 (1999).  The determination as to whether these requirements are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and an evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).\r\n\r\nIn making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record.  A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology.  Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if: (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.\r\n\r\nII.  Analysis \r\n\r\nThe Veteran is seeking service connection for hypertension, which he has claimed is either etiologically related to his in-service herbicide exposure or his service-connected PTSD.  As a preliminary matter the Board notes that herbicide exposure has been conceded due to the Veteran's service in country service in Vietnam between 1969 and 1971.     \r\n\r\nA May 2009 VA opinion was obtained which concluded that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's hypertension was caused by his PTSD because \"There is no established well documented [e]tiolgoical relation between PTSD and benign essential hypertension.\" The VA opinion provider noted the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) did not contain evidence of liable hypertension which is associated with episodes of stress.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran submitted a November 2011 opinion from his private physician which indicated that his hypertension was associated with his PTSD.  The Veteran also submitted several articles which noted a link between hypertension and PTSD.  See, Stress on Your Body, 2009,  Hypertension in relation to [PTSD] and depression in National Comorbidity Survey Abstract, 2009, [PTSD] and Cardiovascular Disease,  2011, Ask The Mayo Clinic: PTSD, high blood pressure and heart disease can be related, 2008.  \r\n\r\nA VA treatment provider provided a September 2012 letter noting that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension in April 2004 and that it was more likely than not that his hypertension was related to his PTSD.\r\n\r\nFollowing a February 2013 Board remand, the Veteran was provided with a February 2013 VA examination in connection with his claim for service connection for hypertension.  The examiner concluded the Veteran's hypertension was not etiologically related to his active service because he did not have hypertension in service.  The examiner also concluded that the Veteran's hypertension was not caused by his service-connected PTSD because his PTSD was stable and not serious enough to cause hyper adrenergic state. \r\n\r\nIn July 2016 the Board requested a medical opinion to address whether the Veteran's current hypertension was etiologically related to his active service, to include his exposure to herbicides, or his service-connected PTSD.  A November 2016 opinion was provided.  The opinion provider concluded that the Veteran's hypertension was etiologically related to his active service, to include herbicide exposure.  The opinion provider explained that a 2014 report from the Institute of Medicine regarding Veterans and Agent Orange found that there is limited and suggestive evidence that hypertension might be linked to herbicide exposure.  The examiner also commented on the biological mechanism for effect on vasculature.  It was the examiner's conclusion that the Veteran's \"hypertension is at least as likely as not secondary to his Agent Orange exposure.\"  \r\n\r\nThe opinion provider also concluded that the Veteran's hypertension was caused by his service-connected PTSD.  The opinion provider noted that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms were noted as severe as evidenced by his marital strain, work conflicts, and social isolation.  The opinion provider found that the Veteran's PTSD was so severe that it caused a state of chronic stress.  The opinion provider listed several studies which noted PTSD had an impact on cardiovascular disease to include hypertension.  The opinion provider found the May 2009 VA negative nexus opinion inadequate as since that time the studies the opinion provider previously mentioned found a link between PTSD and hypertension.  As such, the opinion provider concluded \"based on the demonstrated correlation between PTSD and hypertension and on the severity of the [Veteran's] PTSD symptoms, the [Veteran's] hypertension is at least as likely as not secondary to his service connected PTSD.\"  The opinion provider found that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD did not aggravate the Veteran's hypertension because the Veteran's hypertension did not worsen significantly over time.  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds the November 2016 medical opinion highly probative evidence which weighs in favor of the Veteran's claim.  The opinion provider provided a thorough rationale for her conclusion which included a review of the evidence in the Veteran's claims file and supporting scientific research.  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds the May 2009 VA opinion inadequate as the opinion provider based her conclusion on the absence of a documented etiological relation between PTSD and hypertension, however, as noted above, the Veteran has provided several articles outlining the possibility of an etiological link between PTSD and hypertension, and the November 2016 opinion provider noted an etiological link between PTSD and hypertension.  Additionally, the Board finds the February 2013 VA examination inadequate as the examiner seemingly based their conclusion on the finding that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD was not severe.  However, the Board notes that the Veteran was provided with an evaluation of 100 percent for his service-connected PTSD effective February 2013.  This evaluation indicates the Veteran's PTSD was so severe that it caused total occupational and social impairment, near continuous depression, disturbances of motivation and mood, and chronic sleep impairment, along with other severe symptoms.  As such, the Board finds the February 2013 VA examiner's opinion inadequate as it did not provide an adequate evaluation of the Veteran's PTSD symptoms.  \r\n\r\nThus, the Board finds the November 2016 positive nexus opinion outweighs the May 2009 and February 2013 negative nexus opinions.  Therefore, when weighing the probative evidence of record, the Board finds that there is a nexus between the Veteran's hypertension and his in-service herbicide exposure as well as his service-connected PTSD.  In this case, there is evidence of a current disability and a probative positive nexus opinion which notes the Veteran's hypertension is etiologically related to his in-service herbicide exposure and service-connected PTSD.  Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for hypertension is warranted.  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for hypertension is granted.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nM.E.

Reid, Associate Counsel \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active military service, including active duty and active duty for training from June 1975 to July 1978, October 1978 to November 1982, and from December 1986 to October 1992. \r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2007 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in Indianapolis, Indiana (hereinafter, Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ)).  \r\nIn May 2014, the Board remanded for additional development.  Subsequently, a rating decision dated April 2016, the AOJ granted service connection for tinnitus.  This award fully satisfied the appeal and the issue is no longer at issue before the Board.  See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997).\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the Veteran originally filed a claim for service connection for PTSD.  In Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) held that, in determining the scope of a claim, the Board must consider the claimant's description of the claim; symptoms described; and the information submitted or developed in support of the claim.  Accordingly, given that the record reflects possible psychiatric diagnoses other than PTSD, the Board has amended the issue on appeal as entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, anxiety, depression, adjustment disorder, and panic disorder.  \r\n\r\nThis appeal was processed using the Virtual VA and Veterans Benefit Management System (VBMS) paperless, electronic claims processing system.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ.  VA will notify the Veteran if further action, on his part, is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nAs noted in the prior Board remand, the Veteran's VA clinic records reflect diagnoses of PTSD, panic disorder, depression, depressive disorder, and anxiety disorder.  The Veteran has reported a multitude of PTSD stressors which include: 1) witnessing a soldier shoot himself in 1982 (VA clinic record dated March 2004); 2) seeing people dying including a boy blowing up himself while stationed in Germany (VA clinic record dated June 2004); 3) witnessing the decapitation of soldier \"O'Brien\" during a helicopter accident in 1978 while assigned with the 4th Engineer Battalion at Fort Carson, Colorado (VA Form 21-0781 received September 2008); 4) witnessing the leg of \"Sgt. 1st Class Brown\" being severed during a tank accident in 1982 while assigned to the 1st & 10th Charlie Company Infantry (VA Form 21-0781 received September 2008); 5) earning a bronze star for service in Desert Storm in 1990 (Private psychologist report dated May 2007); and 6) earning a bronze star for service in Grenada (Private psychologist report dated May 2007).\r\n\r\nThe Board specifically found that the Veteran had submitted sufficient information to attempt to verify the stressors which allegedly occurred in 1978 and 1982, as he provided an approximate date of the event, the location of the event, the name of the individual involved and the unit of assignment.  However, the Board required further information regarding the other claimed stressors.  As such, the Board directed the AOJ to obtain additional information from the Veteran and attempt to verify the stressors which allegedly occurred in 1978 and 1982 with the U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) as well as any additional stressors which may be verifiable.\r\n\r\nIn response, the AOJ attempted to obtain additional information but the Veteran did not respond.  As for as verifying the 1978 and 1982 stressors with JSRRC, the JSRRC coordinator issued a formal finding of lack of information to corroborate the stressors citing provisions in the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) M21-1 requiring a written statement from the Veteran prior to submitting a JSRRC request.\r\n\r\nThe Board understands that the AOJ and JSRRC have specifically defined development procedures for corroborating stressors.  However, the Federal Circuit Court has repeatedly emphasized that the VA adjudication system is \"paternalistic\" and \"uniquely pro-claimant\" in nature.  See Jaquay v. Principi, 304 F.3d 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Nolen v. Gober, 222 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Hensley v. West, 212 F.3d 1255 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  Additionally, the AOJ and JSRRC development procedures must be viewed in the context of VA's statutory obligations.  See Gagne v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 397 (2015) (holding that VA's duty to assist is not bound by the JSRRC's requirement to provide the occurrence of an event within a 60-day period, and that strict adherence to the VA Adjudication Procedures Manual could not override VA's statutory duty to assist when a corroboration research could not be deemed \"futile.\")\r\n\r\nConsistent with Gagne and Jaquay, the Board has \"built up\" the Veteran's stressor details by his various statements of record, to include his reports to VA clinicians, finding the sufficient information was available for verifying the 1978 and 1982 stressors with JSRRC.  The AOJ's reliance on the VA Adjudication Procedures Manual is an insufficient basis to comply with the prior remand directives.  Therefore, the case must be remanded for compliance with the prior remand directives.  Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).\r\n\r\nAs for the VA examination, the Board observes that the VA examiner in April 2016 diagnosed depressive disorder due to other medical conditions and alcohol use disorder.  The examiner did not address the other diagnoses of record which now include anxiety and panic disorder without agoraphobia, panic disorder with agoraphobia, depression not otherwise specified (NOS), major depressive disorder and PTSD.  Following an attempt at JSRRC corroboration, the claims folder must be returned to the examiner to clarify whether these additional diagnoses may be attributable to service, or whether such diagnoses were incorrect.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Associate with the claims folder records of the Veteran's VA treatment since December 2015.\r\n\r\n2.  The Veteran should once again be requested to provide additional information regarding the following alleged PTSD stressors:\r\n\r\n   a) the location, unit of assignment and name of the soldier who shot himself in 1982;\r\n   b) further details on the date, location and type of event wherein he saw people dying including a boy blowing up himself while stationed in Germany;\r\n   c) his unit assignment and circumstances which led to his claimed award of a Bronze Star for service in Desert Storm in 1990; and\r\n   d) his unit assignment and circumstances which led to his claimed award of a Bronze Star for service in Grenada.\r\n\r\n3.  Attempt to verify the following stressors with the JSRRC regardless of the guidance procedures of the VA Adjudication Procedures Manual and perform searches in 60 day increments if necessary (see Gagne v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 397 (2015) (holding that VA's duty to assist is not bound by the JSRRC's requirement to provide the occurrence of an event within a 60-day period, and that strict adherence to the VA Adjudication Procedures Manual could not override VA's statutory duty to assist when a corroboration research could not be deemed \"futile.\"):\r\n\r\n   a) the alleged witnessing of the decapitation of soldier \"O'Brien\" during a helicopter accident in 1978 while assigned with the 4th Engineer Battalion at Fort Carson, Colorado (VA Form 21-0781 received September 2008); \r\n   b) the alleged witnessing of the leg of \"Sgt. 1st Class Brown\" being severed during a tank accident in 1982 while assigned to the 1st & 10th Charlie Company Infantry (VA Form 21-0781 received September 2008); and\r\n   c) any additional stressors which may be verifiable.\r\n\r\n4.  Thereafter, return the claims folder to the April 2016 VA examiner for an addendum opinion.  If the examiner is unavailable, forward the claims folder to a similarly qualified examiner.  The need for additional examination is left to the discretion of the examiner.\r\n   a) Identify all current acquired psychiatric disorder(s) that have been present since service under DSM-IV criteria, including consideration of the diagnoses of depressive disorder due to other medical conditions, alcohol use disorder, anxiety and panic disorder without agoraphobia, panic disorder with agoraphobia, depression NOS, major depressive disorder and PTSD.  The examiner is requested to opine whether each of these prior diagnoses was proper and currently asymptomatic, or a misdiagnosis.\r\n   b) If PTSD is diagnosed at any time since service, the examiner should comment upon the link between the current symptomatology and any verified in-service stressor, including the fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.\r\n\tc) For any other acquired psychiatric disorder diagnosed since service even if currently asymptomatic, opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (a 50 percent or higher probability) that such disorder had its onset during or was otherwise related to his service?\r\n\r\nThe examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms, treatment, events, and injuries in service and that his assertions must be taken into account, along with the other evidence of record, in formulating the requested medical opinion, including his inconsistent reports such as serving in Desert Storm which is not verified by his personnel records.\r\n\r\nA complete rationale should accompany each opinion provided and should be based on examination findings, historical records, and medical principles.\r\n\r\n5.  Thereafter, readjudicate the claim.

Jimerfield, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from June 1977 to July 1997.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2008 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Houston, Texas.  The matter was remanded by the Board in February 2015, December 2015, and May 2016.  It now returns for further appellate review.\r\n\r\nThis appeal was processed using the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) and Virtual VA paperless claims processing systems.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the Veteran if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nAlthough the Board regrets the additional delay, another remand is necessary to ensure that due process is followed and that there is a complete record upon which to decide the Veteran's claims so that he is afforded every possible consideration. See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159 (2016).  In addition, where the remand orders of the Board are not complied with, the Board errs as a matter of law when it fails to ensure compliance.  Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that his sleep apnea was incurred in service, or in the alternative, that it is secondary to his service-connected PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn May 2015, pursuant to the Board's February 2015 remand directives, the AOJ afforded the Veteran a VA examination as to his sleep apnea and, in August 2015, obtained that addressed whether such disorder was caused or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD.  During the May 2015 VA examination, the Veteran asserted that he was given a CPAP machine to assist him with his sleep apnea, but he was not using the mask because it made him feel like he was using a gas mask in-service and caused him to wake up \"fighting for air.\"  Thereafter, in the August 2015 opinion, the examiner found that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's sleep apnea was proximately due to or the result of his PTSD.  She further stated that she was not aware of any evidence based medical literature that substantiates a claim that PTSD permanently worsened or aggravated sleep apnea.  However, in the December 2015 remand, the Board found that the examiner did not specifically comment on the Veteran's report of his inability to use the CPAP machine because he associates it with a gas mask, which was problematic as such raised the question of whether any of the Veteran's PTSD symptomatology aggravates his sleep apnea.  Furthermore, the Board noted that there was no opinion of record that addressed direct service connection. \r\n\r\nThereafter, in February 2016, pursuant to the Board's December 2015 remand directives, the AOJ obtained a VA opinion addressing the etiology of the Veteran's sleep apnea.  In this regard, the examiner offered opinions as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea was related to his service, and/or was caused or aggravated by his PTSD.  However, as highlighted in a March 2016 Written Brief Presentation submitted by the Veteran's representative, the February 2016 VA examination report lists a different patient name at the top of the report.  For this reason, the Board found a remand was appropriate to ascertain whether the February 2016 VA examination report relates to the Veteran in the present appeal and, if so, to obtain an addendum opinion addressing his specific contentions and, if not, to obtain the necessary opinions.  In this regard, in the remand directives, the Board noted that the Veteran's specific contentions included his report that he was recommended to undergo a sleep study during his retirement physical but refused as he thought it would be a waste of time, his report of trouble sleeping and that he would sleep at two or three hour intervals on his February 1997 Report of Medical History prepared for discharge from service, and his inability to use the CPAP machine because he associates it with a gas mask.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, in June 2016, another VA opinion was obtained in which the examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's sleep apnea was incurred in or caused by his military service, or is proximately due to or the result of his service-connected PTSD.  With regard to the aspect of the Veteran's claim pertaining to direct service connection, the examiner offered sufficient rationale, which included specific consideration of his report that he was recommended to undergo a sleep study during his retirement physical but refused as he thought it would be a waste of time, and his report of trouble sleeping and that he would sleep at two or three hour intervals on his February 1997 Report of Medical History prepared for discharge from service.  However, such opinion does not specifically address the aggravation prong of secondary service connection and, while the examiner noted the Veteran's report that he is unable to use the CPAP machine because he associates it with a gas mask, she did not comment upon whether such results in the causation or aggravation of his sleep apnea.  Therefore, another remand is necessary in order to obtain an addendum opinion addressing such inquiries. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Return the record to the VA examiner who offered the opinion in June 2016.  The record and a copy of this Remand must be made available to the examiner.  The examiner shall note in the examination report that the record and the Remand have been reviewed.  If the June 2016 examiner is unavailable, the record should be provided to an appropriate medical professional to render the requested opinion. The need for an additional examination of the Veteran is left to the discretion of the clinician selected to write the addendum opinion.\r\n\r\nAfter review of the record, please offer an addendum opinion addressing whether it at least as likely as not (i.e., a 50 percent probability or greater) that the Veteran's sleep apnea is caused OR aggravated by his PTSD.  In addressing such inquiry, the examiner should specifically comment upon whether the Veteran's inability to use the CPAP machine because he associates it with a gas mask has caused or aggravated his sleep apnea.  \r\n\r\nA complete rationale should be provided for any opinions expressed.\r\n\r\n2.  After completing the above action, to include any other development as may be indicated by any response received as a consequence of the actions taken in the preceding paragraphs, the Veteran's claim should be readjudicated based on the entirety of the evidence.  If the claim remains denied, the Veteran and his representative should be issued a supplemental statement of the case.  An appropriate period of time should be allowed for response.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Stephen Eckerman, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from June 1963 to September 1966. \r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) on appeal from a May 2011 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Petersburg, Florida.  In July and November of 2015, the Board remanded the claim for additional development.  \r\n\r\nIn April 2013, the Veteran requested a videoconference hearing before the Board on the issue on appeal, but subsequently withdrew that request in a July 2013 letter.  See Veteran's representative's letters, dated in July and December of 2013, and June 2014.  As such, the Veteran's hearing request is deemed withdrawn.  See 38 C.F.R. � 20.704 (e) (2016).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran does not have an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, that was caused by his service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nAn acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, was not caused by service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304(f) (2016).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he has an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, that was caused by his active duty service.  \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  Service connection may also be granted on the basis of a post-service initial diagnosis of a disease, when \"all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred during service.\"  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d). \r\n\r\nApplicable regulations provide that service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a), a link, established by medical evidence between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nThe regulations governing PTSD were amended, effective July 13, 2010.  75 Fed. Reg. 39843 -52 (July 13, 2010).  Specifically, this amendment eliminates the requirement for corroborating that the claimed in-service stressor occurred if a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to his/her fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the veteran's service.  Id.  \r\n\r\nVA's General Counsel  has concluded that direct service connection for a disability that is a result of a claimant's own abuse of alcohol or drugs is precluded for purposes of all VA benefits for claims filed after October 31, 1990.  VAOPGCPREC 7-99, 64 Fed. Reg. 52,375 (1999); see also VAOPGCPREC 2-98, 63 Fed. Reg. 31,263 (1998).  That is because section 8052 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 1990), Public Law No. 101- 508, � 8052, 104 Stat. 1388 , 1388-351, amended the status governing line of duty determinations and the definition of a \"service-connected\" disability.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 101(16) and 105(a).  VA General Counsel  precedent opinions are binding on the Board.  Brooks v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 484 (1993).  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's personnel records show that he served in the Republic of Vietnam with the Marine Corps, with duty as a field radio operator, and that he participated in multiple combat operations. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records do not show any relevant complaints, treatment, or diagnoses.  The Veteran's separation examination report, dated in September 1966, shows that his psychiatric condition was clinically evaluated as normal.  \r\n\r\nAs for the post-service medical evidence, VA progress notes, beginning in 2009, show findings of a depressive disorder NOS (not otherwise specified) or depressive disorder NEC (not elsewhere classified), a panic disorder (characterized as \"in remission\"), and alcohol abuse, with use of medications that included buproprion, and citalopram.\r\n\r\nA VA PTSD examination report, dated in March 2011, shows that the examiner (Dr. H) indicated that the Veteran's claims file had been reviewed.  The diagnoses were alcohol dependence (by history), depressive disorder (by history), and rule out alcohol-induced mood disorder, chronic.  Dr. H indicated that the Veteran's stressors do not appear to be linked to his previously diagnosed condition, and that the Veteran was not diagnosed with PTSD based on the current examination.  Dr. H concluded that it is less likely than not that the Veteran has PTSD due to a fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.  He stated that the Veteran does not appear to currently meet sufficient diagnostic criteria to support the diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn July 2015, the Board remanded the claim for a supplemental opinion from Dr. H as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran has a depressive disorder, or any other acquired psychiatric disorder (other than PTSD), that is due to his service.  \r\n\r\nA supplemental opinion from Dr. H, dated in July 2015, shows that he stated that he could not resolve the issue without resort to mere speculation.  He explained the following: in contrast to PTSD, which has a clear and specified etiology (i.e., traumatic stress), an unspecified depressive disorder (i.e., the Veteran's diagnosis of record) does not have a clear, specified etiology.  Therefore, the issue cannot be determined to a reasonable degree of professional certainty.  In other words, an opinion would require a resort to mere speculation and there would be insufficient professional certainty associated with it.  \r\n\r\nIn November 2015, the Board remanded the claim.  The Board stated that it was unclear whether or not Dr. H had reviewed the Veteran's claims file prior to his July 2015 opinion, and that he had failed to discuss the Veteran's reported history of his symptoms.  The Board therefore requested a supplemental opinion.    \r\n\r\nA statement from a private psychologist, Dr. P, dated in November 2013, states that the Veteran's primary issues are as a result of trauma from the Vietnam War.  His most problematic diagnosis is PTSD, which has been a chronic issue since that time.  Additional problems, such as chronic major depression (diagnosed as major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, without psychotic features) and adjustment problems causing anxiety, are likely a direct result of trauma from Vietnam.  Of note, Dr. P failed to explain how the DSM criteria were met to support the diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\nA VA mental disorders disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ), dated in January 2016, shows that the examiner (Dr. L) indicated that the Veteran's e-folder (VBMS or Virtual VA) had been reviewed.  The report shows that the Veteran's social, educational, occupational, and mental health histories were taken and summarized.  The Veteran reported first receiving treatment for psychiatric symptoms in 2005.  Dr. L stated that the Veteran's current Axis I diagnosis was unspecified depressive disorder.  Dr. L stated the following: the Veteran's symptoms do not meet the criteria for PTSD based on objective test results and diagnostic clinical interview.  There is no objective evidence or data to support the diagnosis of PTSD at this time.  There is a significant length of time between the Veteran's military service and his first complaint of mood symptoms.  His discharge was in 1966 and he was first seen in 2005.  Due to the long period between military service and his first complaint of mental health symptoms, and the lack of evidence of treatment for any mental health disorder while in the military, it is the examiner's opinion that it is less likely as not that the Veteran's current unspecified depressive disorder is related to his military service.  \r\n\r\nWith regard to PTSD, the Board finds that the evidence is insufficient to show that the Veteran currently has PTSD.  In fact, there is highly significant medical evidence against such a finding, as noted above.  See Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353   (Fed. Cir. 1998) (under 38 U.S.C.A. � 1110, an appellant must submit proof of a presently existing disability resulting from service in order to merit an award of compensation).  VA progress notes show that on several occasions, the Veteran denied having past traumatic exposures.  See VA progress notes, dated in September, October and November of 2010.  He also had a negative PTSD screen in July 2009, and a negative depression screen in June 2010.   In particular, the March 2011 and January 2016 VA examination reports both show that the examiners concluded that the Veteran does not have PTSD.  These opinions are considered highly probative, as they are shown to have been based on a review of the Veteran's claims file, and they are accompanied by sufficient explanations and findings.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000); Neives- Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  In this regard, the January 2016 VA opinion indicates that it was based, in part, on objective test results.  Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (recognizing the Board's \"authority to discount the weight and probity of evidence in light of its own inherent characteristics and its relationship to other items of evidence\").  Accordingly, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for PTSD, and that the claim must be denied.\r\n\r\nThe Board is cognizant that in McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321   (2007), the Court held that the requirement of a current disability is satisfied when the claimant had a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation was filed, or during the pendency of that claim, and that a claimant may be granted service connection even though the disability resolves prior to the Secretary's adjudication of the claim.  Here, however, while one medical professional did suggest that the Veteran's most problematic diagnosis was PTSD, he did not explain how the Veteran met the DSM criteria for PTSD.  Conversely, as noted above, multiple VA examiners have explained why the Veteran did not meet the DSM criteria and have conducted testing which also failed to support a diagnosis.  As such, while PTSD may be noted in the record, the Board believes that the weight of the evidence is against the finding that the Veteran has had PTSD at any point during the course of his appeal.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD, the Board finds that the claim must be denied.  The Veteran's service treatment records have been discussed.  They do not show an relevant psychiatric treatment, findings, or diagnoses.  His psychiatric condition was clinically evaluated as normal upon separation from service in September 1966.  Given the foregoing, a chronic condition is not shown during service.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b).  \r\n\r\nTo the extent that the VA progress notes show that the Veteran has post-service diagnoses involving alcohol abuse, compensation may not be awarded for this, even if such were shown during service.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 105, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.301(c).  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has been diagnosed with depression.  The earliest post-service medical evidence of treatment for psychiatric symptoms is dated in 2009, which is approximately 42 years after his active duty service.  The January 2016 VA opinion weighs against the claim.  Although the Board has considered the opinion of Dr. P, his opinion is not shown to have been based on review of the Veteran's claims file, or any other detailed and reliable history.  Prejean.  In addition, he does not cite to any inservice or post-service complaints or findings, other than to note a history of (undated) diagnoses of depression.  Neives-Rodriguez.  Furthermore, and in any event, a depressive disorder is not among the disorders listed at 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(a), and the theory of continuity of symptomatology can be used only in cases involving those conditions explicitly recognized as chronic 38 C.F.R.  � 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338-39 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (holding that the term \"chronic disease in 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b) is limited to a chronic disease listed at 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(a)).  Accordingly, this evidence is insufficiently probative to warrant a grant of the claim, and the claim must be denied.  \r\n\r\nWith regard to the Veteran's own contentions, although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, see Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011), as to the specific issue in this case, it falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Although the Veteran is competent to report the presence of psychiatric symptoms, the claimed disability is not the type of condition that is readily amenable to mere lay diagnosis or probative comment regarding its etiology, as the evidence shows that specific findings are needed to properly assess and diagnose such disorders.  Jandreau; Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007).   The Board has considered that Dr. P's report indicates that the Veteran has had ongoing PTSD symptoms since his service.  However, the Board finds that the VA progress notes and opinions, discussed supra, are more probative of this issue.  Madden.  The Board has determined that service connection is not warranted for the claimed disability.  Given the foregoing, the Board finds that the medical evidence outweighs the appellant's contentions to the effect that he has the claimed condition due to his service.  Id.  \r\n\r\nAs the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.  See generally Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).\r\n\r\nDuty to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThere is no indication in this record of a failure to notify.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3rd 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2015).\r\n\r\nPursuant to the duty to assist, VA must obtain \"records of relevant medical treatment or examination\" at VA facilities.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(c)(2).  All records pertaining to the condition at issue are presumptively relevant.  See Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  \r\n\r\nIn addition, where the Veteran \"sufficiently identifies\" other VA medical records that he or she desires to be obtained, VA must also seek those records even if they do not appear potentially relevant based upon the available information.  Sullivan v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 786, 793 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (citing 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(3)).  In this case, the Veteran has not indicated that such records exist, and all pertinent records have been obtained.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, at the request of the Veteran's representative, the Board waited 90 days to adjudicate this claim in order for additional evidence to be presented.  Unfortunately, no additional evidence was received.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has been afforded an examination, and he has been determined to not have PTSD, or an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD that is related to his service.  \r\n\r\nIn November 2015, the Board remanded this claim.  The Board directed that a supplemental opinion be obtained, and that the examiner provide an etiological opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (a 50 percent probability or greater) that the Veteran's diagnosed depressive disorder, and/or any other identified mental health disability, is related to his period of active service.  In January 2016, the was done.  The Board has considered that the January 2016 VA examiner indicated the Veteran did not meet the criteria for PTSD under DSM-5.  See 70 Fed. Reg. 45,093 (Aug. 4, 2014).  DSM-5 sets forth four distinct diagnostic clusters for PTSD, as opposed to the three set forth in DSM-IV (re-experiencing, avoidance, and arousal).  As the January 2016 VA opinion states that the Veteran fails to meet the criteria for anxious arousal, intrusive experience, and defensive avoidance, he clearly fails to meet the criteria for PTSD under DSM-IV, notwithstanding his citation to DSM-5.  Therefore, no prejudice accrues to the Veteran.  Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384 (1993); Hickson v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 394 (2010).  Under the circumstances, the Board finds that there has been substantial compliance with its remand.  See Dyment v. West, 13 Vet. App. 141, 146-147 (1999) (remand not required under Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998) where Board's remand instructions were substantially complied with).\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran has not been prejudiced by a failure of VA in its duty to assist, and that any violation of the duty to assist could be no more than harmless error.  See Conway  v. Principi, 353 F.3d 1369 (Fed.

Vang, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from November 1965 to November 1968.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2008 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Huntington, West Virginia, which denied the Veteran's petition to re-open his claim for service connection for a claimed nervous disorder, to include PTSD, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and anxiety.  \r\n\r\nOn the December 2009 substantive appeal, the Veteran requested a Board hearing.  However, in September 2011, the Veteran withdrew his request for a Board hearing.  As the Veteran did not subsequently submit a motion for a new hearing, the hearing request is deemed withdrawn.  See 38 C.F.R. � 20.704(e) (2016).\r\n\r\nThe claim was previously before the Board.  In January 2012, the Board granted the Veteran's petition to re-open the claim and remanded the claim for additional development and an examination.  In February 2016, the claim was remanded again for a new examination.  In March 2016, an examination was completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The Veteran has current diagnoses of panic disorder with agoraphobia and depressive disorder NOS, but the most probative evidence of record does not show a diagnosis of PTSD during the pendency of the appeal.\r\n\r\n2.  The most probative evidence of record indicates that the Veteran's panic disorder with agoraphobia and depressive disorder NOS are etiologically related to service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\n1.  Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include panic disorder with agoraphobia and depressive disorder NOS, have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107(b) (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303(a) (2016).\r\n\r\n2.  The criteria for service connection for PTSD are not met.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110, (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303(a), 3.304(f) (2016).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nDuties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veteran Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), in part, describes VA's duties to notify and assist a claimant in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.326 (2016).  \r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application for benefits, and prior to an initial unfavorable decision, VA is required to notify the claimant and his or her representative, if any, of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  Proper notice from VA must inform the claimant of any information and evidence not of record: (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a) (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(b) (2016); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183, 187 (2002); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 120 (2004). \r\n\r\nVA also has a duty to assist the Veteran in the development of the claim.  This duty includes assisting the Veteran in obtaining service treatment records and pertinent treatment records and providing an examination when necessary.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c) (2016); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83-86 (2006).  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the claim for PTSD, the Board finds that VA has met its duties to notify and assist the Veteran.  VCAA notice requirements were satisfied by virtue of a letter dated April 2008, which was sent to the Veteran prior to the October 2008 decision.  The letter informed the Veteran of what evidence was required to substantiate the claim, and of his and VA's respective duties for obtaining evidence, as well as how disability ratings and effective dates are assigned.  The Board notes that during the course of the appeal period, the Veteran has indicated to VA examiners that he received mental health treatment at private facilities in the early 1980s.  However, the Board finds that additional development for these records is unnecessary because, as discussed in further detail below, the record does not contain evidence of a current diagnosis of PTSD during the appeal period.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (stating that remands which would only result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the Veteran are to be avoided).  Therefore, no further development is required in regard to the PTSD claim.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the remaining issues of entitlement to service connection, the Board finds that VA's fulfillment of its duties to notify and assist need not be addressed at this time, considering that the service connection claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include panic disorder and depressive disorder, is granted.\r\n\r\nLegal Criteria\r\n\r\nEntitlement to VA compensation may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service; or for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a) (2016).  \r\n\r\nGenerally, establishing service connection for a claimed disability requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).  \r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD specifically requires medical evidence establishing a diagnosis of PTSD; credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and a link, established by medical evidence, between the current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2016).  For claims certified for appeal to the Board or are pending before the Board prior to August 4, 2014, VA must apply the diagnostic criteria for PTSD set forth in the DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL FOR MENTAL DISORDERS, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). \r\n\r\nThe Veteran must present credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (2016).  Generally, lay testimony alone is not sufficient to establish that a stressor occurred and the record must contain evidence substantiating the occurrence of the claimed stressors.  However, there are specific circumstances in which lay testimony may be sufficient to establish a claimed stressor if, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service.  Id.\r\n\r\nThe Board is required to assess the credibility and probative weight of all relevant evidence, and may consider factors such as facial plausibility, bias, self-interest, and consistency with other evidence of record.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 325 (2007) (Greene, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (noting that the Board has the duty to assess credibility and probative weight of evidence); see Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (affirming that the Board retains discretion to make credibility determinations and otherwise weigh the evidence submitted, including lay evidence).  \r\n\r\nThe probative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the medical expert's personal examination of the patient, the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion that the physician reaches.  Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993).  As such, the Board may appropriately favor the opinion of one competent medical authority over another.  Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995); see Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 367 (2001).  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b) (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102 (2016).  When the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, the claim will be granted.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 54-55 (1990); see Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 531 (2014).  If the preponderance of the evidence weighs against the claim, it must be denied.  Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996). \r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that an acquired psychiatric disorder was incurred in active service.  See March 2008 VA Form 21-4138. \r\n\r\nPreliminarily, the Board notes that the evidence does not suggest, nor does the Veteran assert, that he was engaged in combat with the enemy or that his claimed PTSD is related to combat.  Although the Veteran served in a combat zone, Vietnam, his service personnel records and DD Form 214 do not reflect that he participated in combat or received any medals indicating combat service.  Thus, the combat provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154 are not applicable in this case. See VAOPGCPREC 12-99 (October 18, 1999) (finding that � 1154 does not apply to veterans who served in combat zones, but did not themselves engage in combat with the enemy).  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the first service connection element, a current diagnosis, the Veteran has diagnoses of panic disorder with agoraphobia and depressive disorder NOS.  See September 2008 VA Examination; October 2009 VA Examination.  However, there is conflicting medical evidence as to whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD during the appeal period.  \r\n\r\nIn a May 2008 opinion, a Vet Center clinician opined that the Veteran presented with sufficient symptoms to warrant a diagnosis of PTSD, panic disorder with agoraphobic features, and depression.  The clinician addressed the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria A through D, but did not address criteria E and F.  In a May 2009 Vet Center record, a clinician noted that the Veteran's symptoms were significant, probable, and prominent with PTSD, but did not provide an assessment of the DSM-IV criteria. \r\n\r\nEarly VA medical records indicate that the Veteran was provided with a provisional diagnosis of PTSD during the appeal period.  In a June 2008 VA record, the Veteran was given a provisional diagnosis of PTSD.  In an August 2008 VA record, the Veteran presented with and was treated for unremitting PTSD symptoms.  In a November 2008 VA record, the Veteran was noted to have a significant history of chronic PTSD.  \r\n\r\nHowever, subsequent VA examinations have not revealed a diagnosis of PTSD.  In a September 2008 VA examination, the examiner opined that the DSM-IV criteria for a PTSD diagnosis were not met.  In an October 2009 VA examination, the Veteran received a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia and depressive disorder NOS, but a diagnosis of PTSD was ruled out.  The examiner opined that Vet Center records appeared consistent with a diagnosis of panic disorder rather than PTSD.  Moreover, the examiner stated that the May 2008 Vet Center opinion did not contain information about how a PTSD diagnosis was derived.  In a March 2016 VA examination, the examiner opined that the diagnostic criteria for a PTSD diagnosis were not met.\r\n\r\nBased on a review of the record, the Board finds that the evidence is against a finding of PTSD diagnosis during the appeal period.  The Board acknowledges that Vet Center records and early VA medical records indicate that the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD.  However, the Veteran's Vet Center diagnosis of PTSD is not shown to have been diagnosed in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125 (2016).  Specifically, the provisions of � 4.125 applicable in this case require a diagnosis of PTSD in conformance with DSM-IV, which outlines six different criteria (A through F) that must be met.  Mental health professionals are generally presumed to have taken into account the required DSM requirements for a PTSD diagnosis, unless there is evidence to the contrary.  See Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 140 (1997).  The Board notes that the May 2008 Vet Center opinion and remaining Vet Center records did not address all the required DSM-IV criteria and, as such, does not meet the requirements for a diagnosis during the pendency of the appeal.  Further, subsequent VA examinations have ruled out a diagnosis of PTSD after addressing all the criteria set forth in DSM-IV.  As such, the Board finds that the May 2008 evidence is not probative.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of PTSD during the pendency of the appeal, but the Veteran does have current diagnoses of panic disorder with agoraphobia and depressive disorder NOS.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992) (specifically limiting entitlement to service-connected benefits to cases where there is a current disability).  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the second service connection element, an in-service incurrence or event, the Veteran maintains that he experienced a significant amount of trauma after witnessing a soldier drown in service.  See May 2008 VA Form 21-0781.  Additionally, the Veteran testified that he feared for his life because his duties as a cargo handler involved handling munitions and explosives.  See March 2013 DRO Hearing Transcript; see also DD Form 214 (showing that the Veteran's Military Occupational Specialty was cargo handler).  The record contains a March 1967 Report of Casualty that corroborates the Veteran's report of a drowning in service.  Additionally, the October 2009 VA examiner opined that the Veteran was exposed to a traumatic event because he witnessed a death in service.  As such, the Board finds that there is credible evidence that an in-service event occurred.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the third service connection element, evidence of a nexus between the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder and active service, the Board notes that there are several conflicting medical opinions.  \r\n\r\nPrior to the appeal period, in a June 2002 private medical record from C.F.P., a treating clinician noted that the Veteran was suffering from depression, panic attacks, and post-traumatic stress from the Vietnam War.  A rationale was not provided.  In September 2006, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination wherein he reported that his panic disorder started immediately after returning from Vietnam and that it got worse over the years.  The examiner opined that the panic disorder was at least as likely as not related to service, based on the history provided by the Veteran.  However, in rendering this opinion, the examiner relied on the Veteran's report of being in a combat zone and exposure to killing in the war in Vietnam.  As previously noted, the record does not indicate that the Veteran was engaged in combat during service.  As such, the Board finds the September 2006 opinion to be of limited probative value.  See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (holding that the Board may reject a medical opinion based on an inaccurate factual basis).\r\n\r\nIn a May 2008 opinion, a Vet Center clinician determined that the Veteran presented with sufficient symptoms to warrant a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia and depression.  The clinician opined that the Veteran's pattern of anger, distress, and fear were related to issues surrounding Vietnam.  Although the opinion was brief and did not reconcile the Veteran's inconsistent self-reports as to the onset of his symptoms, the Board finds that the May 2008 opinion is credible and probative because it is based on the clinician's knowledge of the Veteran's disorder.  See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012) (specifying that the fact that the rationale provided by an examiner \"did not explicitly lay out the examiner's journey from the facts to a conclusion,\" did not render the examination inadequate); see also Guerrieri, 4 Vet. App. at 470-71.  Additionally, the Veteran's Vet Center records indicate that the clinician is familiar with the history and treatment of the Veteran's panic disorder and depressive disorder NOS.  See Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 294 (2012) (finding medical reports must be read as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record).  \r\n\r\nIn September 2008, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination wherein the Veteran reported that he first sought mental health treatment for his panic attacks in the early 1980s.  A nexus opinion was not provided.  As such, the examination is inadequate for the Board to make an informed decision on the Veteran's claim.\r\n\r\nIn October 2009, the Veteran was afforded another VA examination.  The Veteran reported that his symptoms started in 1976, but was unable to recall his first panic attack or the circumstances surrounding it.  The examiner, C.H., opined that it was less likely than not that the panic disorder was caused by active service because it was not possible to hypothesize as to the origins of the panic disorder.  However, he did not address whether additional evidence was needed or whether his inability to provide an opinion was based on the limits of medical knowledge.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382, 392-93 (2011).  He also opined that it was theoretically possible that the Veteran's panic disorder was related to service, but there was no available evidence to directly link the two and, as such, it was less likely than not related to the in-service event.  \r\n\r\nIn a July 2010 addendum opinion, C.H. provided another opinion.  For the sake of clarity, the Board notes that the examiner initially addresses the Veteran's disorder as a panic disorder, but subsequently refers to it as an anxiety disorder.  It is unclear if the examiner's use of the term anxiety disorder also encompasses the Veteran's depressive disorder NOS.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's anxiety disorder was less likely than not related to service, but it remained possible that it was related to service.  He noted that the Veteran provided inconsistent reports of when his panic disorder manifested, that discharge documents were silent for complaints, and that there was no evidence of treatment until the early 1980s.  Additionally, he stated that the evidence argued against the presence of a psychiatric disorder until the 1980s because the Veteran did not experience significant enough impairment to seek treatment until then.  \r\n\r\nThe Board acknowledges that the Veteran's self-reports regarding the date of onset have been inconsistent.  However, the October 2009 and July 2010 opinions are internally inconsistent because the opinions appear to weigh both in favor and against the Veteran's claim.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008) (emphasizing that \"a medical opinion must contain clear conclusions and supporting data, as well as 'a reasoned medical explanation' connecting the two\").  As such, the October 2009 examination and July 2010 opinion are of limited probative value.  \r\n\r\nIn June 2014, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination.  However, the Veteran was unable to complete the examination.  As such, the examination is inadequate for the Board to make an informed decision on the Veteran's claim.\r\n\r\nIn March 2016, the Veteran was afforded another VA examination.  The Veteran reported that his first panic attack occurred in service and that he first sought treatment from a psychiatrist in the late 1970s.  The examiner opined that the panic disorder was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the death of a friend during service, or fear for his life due to hostile military activities.  The examiner noted that discharge documents were negative for complaints of anxiety, depression, or other psychiatric disorders.  Additionally, she stated that there was no indication of treatment until the early 1980s and thus, no evidence that the full criteria for a psychiatric disorder were met until the 1980s.  The Board finds that the examiner is competent, and the opinion is credible.  However, the opinion is entitled to less probative weight because the examiner relied on the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence without reconciling her opinion with the Veteran's lay statements regarding onset.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 40 (2007) (finding that an examination was inadequate where the examiner did not comment on the Veteran's report of in-service injury and relied on the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence to provide a negative opinion).  Additionally, the examiner did not address the etiology of the Veteran's depressive disorder NOS.  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the record contains medical evidence both for and against the Veteran's claim, but, the most probative evidence of record is in favor of a finding of service connection.  As such, the Board will resolve all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and find that the Veteran's panic disorder and depressive disorder are etiologically related to service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t(CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include panic disorder with agoraphobia and depressive disorder NOS, is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nK.

Pastore, Attorney at Law\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nWilliam Skowronski, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active service from October 1959 to April 1960, November 1961 to August 1962, April 1964 to February 1974. \r\n\r\nThis appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2010 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Seattle, Washington.  \r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  Despite the fact that the RO only adjudicated entitlement to service connection for PTSD, the record shows that the Veteran has been diagnosed with anxiety disorder NOS and major depressive disorder.  Accordingly, the issue is recharacterized as shown on the first page of this decision and it is acknowledged that such description includes a claim of entitlement to service connection for all currently diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorders.\r\n\r\nOn his March 2014 VA Form 9, the Veteran requested a hearing before a member of the Board.  However, in a January 2017 statement, the Veteran's attorney withdrew his request for a hearing. \r\n\r\nThis appeal was processed using the Virtual VA and Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) paperless claims processing systems.\r\n\r\nA motion to advance this appeal on the Board's docket has been raised by the Board's Acting Vice Chairman.  The undersigned is granting the motion and advancing the appeal on the docket based upon advanced age.  38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c) (2016) (\"advanced age\" is defined as 75 or more years of age). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nResolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, he has an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD with anxiety disorder NOS and major depressive disorder, related to his active service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nAn acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD with anxiety disorder NOS and major depressive disorder, was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304, 4.125 (2016).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI. VA's Duty to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nVA has a duty to notify and duty to assist a Veteran in the claims process.  In the instant case, the decision below is fully favorable to the Veteran with regard to the issue of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, and any notice or assistance error is therefore harmless.\r\n\r\nII. Legal Criteria and Analysis\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty or for aggravation of preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303. \r\n\r\nIn order to establish direct service connection, three elements must be established. These elements are: \"(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service,\" which is often referenced as the \"nexus\" requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). \r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD, as opposed to other acquired psychiatric disorders, (when the stressor is not one of those enumerated in 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(1-5 )) requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with VA regulations; (2) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and (3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f). \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nOnce evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994) (distinguishing between competency (\"a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered\") and credibility (\"a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted\").\r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he suffers from PTSD which is due to his experiences in service.  \r\n\r\nAt the outset, the Board notes that the Veteran's claimed stressor relates to a \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.\"  He has reported he witnessed a North Vietnamese prisoner be tortured by South Vietnamese soldiers for two to three days before he was presumably killed as well as seeing many soldiers injured and killed.  If a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terroristic activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimant's stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of events in service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in service stressor.  For purposes of this paragraph, \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" means that a Veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the Veteran or others, such as from an actual potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive devices; incoming artillery, rocket or mortar fires; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the Veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psychophysiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(3)(f) (2016).\r\n\r\nService personnel records confirm the Veteran service in Vietnam.  The experience described by the Veteran involves him witnessing an event that involved actual or threatened death and a threat to the physical integrity of others and is consistent with his service.  Moreover, the described event is consistent with possible conditions of service in Vietnam during the Veteran's time in service.  As such, the stressor of \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" is accepted. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran filed a claim for service connection for PTSD in August 2009.  At the time, he reported it began two years earlier.  He reported his mother and niece died in a house fire then, causing depression to set in.  He also began to have flashbacks of Vietnam.\r\n\r\nThe service treatment records (STRs) do not show treatment for, or a diagnosis of, PTSD or any other psychiatric disorder.\r\n\r\nThe earliest records of VA treatment associated with the claims file in response to the Veteran filing his PTSD claim are from 2007.  A May 2007 VA outpatient treatment record notes the Veteran reported feeling depressed since his mother died in 2007.  Depression/grief was assessed.  A July 2007 VA psychiatry note notes he had been thinking more about Vietnam since his mother's death; sometimes the memories caught him unaware.  The psychiatrist assessed depression NOS, noting he had depressive feelings, insomnia, and intensification of his unpleasant memories from Vietnam and guilty feelings about things he cannot change from his distant past.  A March 2009 mental health team note notes major depressive disorder and PTSD were diagnosed.  The psychiatrist noted he had ongoing symptoms since the death of his mother, but that he also had intrusive memories from Vietnam.  \r\n\r\nVA treatment records show PTSD and major depressive disorder in remission continued to be assessed by the Veteran's VA treatment providers.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA examination in August 2013.  The examiner noted a history of PTSD, but found he did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for a PTSD diagnosis at the time of the examination because his medication was controlling his symptoms.  Anxiety disorder NOS was diagnosed.  The examiner, who presumably has access to the separate database of electronic VA treatment records, indicated an October 2006 VA treatment record notes the Veteran reported having depression since his mother died and having nightmares about Vietnam after he returned from deployment.  The examiner opined the symptoms he reported suggest he first developed PTSD symptoms related to his Vietnam experiences in October 2006.  As noted, records of VA treatment from earlier than 2007 are not associated with the claim file, but the Board has no reason to doubt the examiner's description of the October 2006 treatment.  Notably, a July 2007 treatment note notes he was treated for sleep difficulties in October 2006 and other records show he underwent routine evaluations on the same date of the October 2006 record the examiner referenced, verifying he was receiving VA treatment at that time.  The examiner opined the Veteran met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD in 2009 and 2010.  The examiner diagnosed residuals, including anxiety disorder NOS, and opined it was at as likely as not incurred in service.  The examiner opined the symptoms were associated with his fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.  The examiner found the Veteran's reported stressor of witnessing a North Vietnamese solider being tortured meets the criterion for a PTSD diagnosis.  The examiner noted the Veteran was at peace with the circumstances surrounding his mother's death and opined he had no PTSD symptoms associated with the house fire.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, the Board will resolve any reasonable doubt as to the existing diagnosis of PTSD in the Veteran's favor and finds that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD.  The Board will do so especially upon consideration of the August 2013 VA examiner's assertions that the only reason he does not currently meet the criteria for PTSD is because his medication has his symptoms under control.  \r\n\r\nHaving determined that the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety disorder NOS, and major depressive disorder in remission, the remaining question is whether these psychiatric disabilities are due to service.  In this regard, the record is clear.  The August 2013 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's current psychiatric symptomatology, including the residuals of PTSD-anxiety disorder NOS, are due to his fear of hostile military or terrorist activity he experienced while serving in Vietnam.  The Veteran's VA treatment provider also related the assessed depression to the Veteran's Vietnam experiences.  There is no other opinion of record to the contrary.  \r\n\r\nAs such, the Board finds that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD with anxiety disorder NOS and major depressive disorder in remission, had its onset during service, and therefore, service connection is warranted.

App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD with anxiety disorder NOS and major depressive disorder in remission, is granted\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nE.I.

Riordan, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from February 1972 to May 1973.\r\n\r\nThis matter is on appeal from a November 2009 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.   \r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified before a Veterans Law Judge in June 2013.  A transcript of the hearing is of record.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's initial claim for entitlement to service connection was for PTSD.  The Board has characterized the issue on appeal as one claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (stating that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record).\r\n\r\nThis appeal was remanded by the Board in October 2013 for further development and was denied by the Board in March 2015.  The Veteran appealed this decision to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) which, in a November 2015 Order, granted the parties' Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) and remanded for additional development.  The appeal was once again remanded by the Board in January 2016 to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) for further development.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran is not shown to have an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, that is casually or etiologically related to his period of active service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nService connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is not warranted.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.159, 3.303 (2016).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nDuties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nVA's duty to notify was satisfied by May, June, and July 2009 letters.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5102, 5103, 5103A; 38 C.F.R. � 3.159; Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2015).\r\n\r\nVA must also make reasonable efforts to assist the Veteran in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the claim for the benefit sought, unless no reasonable possibility exists that such assistance would aid in substantiating the claims.  38 U.S.C.A � 5103A; 38 C.F.R. � 3.159.\r\n\r\nService treatment records are associated with the claims file.  All post-service treatment records identified by the Veteran have also been obtained by the VA.  The Veteran has not identified any additional records that should be obtained prior to a Board decision.  Therefore, VA's duty to further assist the Veteran in locating additional records has been satisfied.  The Veteran has been afforded VA examinations in connection with his claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(4).  The Board finds the September 2016 VA examination is adequate for the purposes of determining service connection, as it involved a review of the Veteran's service medical records as well as a clinical evaluation of the Veteran, and provide an adequate discussion of the diagnosis provided.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).\r\n\r\nThe instant claim was previously remanded by the Board in January 2016.  Specifically, the Board noted the December 2013 VA examination was inadequate because it failed to provide a sufficient rationale in support of the examiner's conclusion that the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder, depression, was unrelated to his in-service symptoms.  The Board instructed that the Veteran's claims file be returned to the VA examiner, and that the examiner file an addendum addressing whether the Veteran's current depression is related to his in-service symptoms.  The Board also ordered that if PTSD is diagnosed, the VA examiner should determine if it is linked to an in-service stressor.  Finally, the remand stated that if a personality disorder is diagnosed, the VA examiner is instructed to address whether the disorder was present during service.  In the event that VA examiner was not available, the Board directed that the Veteran be given a new psychiatric examination.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was provided the requested examination in September 2016, which the Board has found to be adequate, as each of the above listed items was addressed.  There has been substantial compliance with the prior remand, and adjudication of the Veteran's claim may proceed.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998).  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, in October 2013, the Veteran's claim was remanded to the AOJ with instructions to schedule the Veteran for a VA mental health examination and obtain additional medical records for further development.  The Board finds that all relevant evidence was obtained and the requested examination was completed in December 2013.  \r\n\r\nIn light of the foregoing, the Board is satisfied that all relevant facts have been adequately developed to the extent possible; no further assistance to the Veteran in developing the facts pertinent to the issue on appeal is required to comply with the duty to assist.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5103, 5103A; 38 C.F.R. � 3.159.\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nBoard decisions must be based on the entire record, with consideration of all the evidence.  The law requires that the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the Veteran.  Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000).  When, after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding service origin, the degree of disability, or any other point, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  By reasonable doubt it is meant that an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence exists which does not satisfactorily prove or disprove the claim.  Reasonable doubt is a substantial doubt and one within the range of probability as distinguished from pure speculation or remote possibility.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102.\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for a chronic disability resulting from injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service.  38 U.S.C.A. �1110; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  There must be competent evidence of a current disability; medical evidence, or in certain circumstances lay evidence, of in-service occurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and competent evidence of a nexus between an in-service injury or disease and the current disability.  See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred. 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) and 38 C.F.R. � 4.125 (requiring PTSD diagnoses to conform to the DSM-IV/V).\r\n\r\nWhile the Veteran is competent to report (1) symptoms observable to a layperson, e.g., depression or anxiety; (2) a diagnosis that is later confirmed by clinical findings; or (3) a contemporary diagnosis, he is not competent to independently render a medical diagnosis or opine as to the specific etiology of a condition. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (2009).  Because there is no universal rule as to competence of a lay person, the Board must decide on a case by case basis whether a particular condition is the type of condition that is within the competence of a lay person to provide an opinion as to etiology.  See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77; see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App 428 (2011).  Lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues.  Kahana, 24 Vet. App. at 435.\r\n\r\nService Connection for PTSD \r\n\r\nInitially, the Board observes that following the Veteran's September 2016 VA examination, the VA examiner determined that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of PTSD.  The VA examiner stated:\r\n\r\nAlthough the Veteran identifies a current diagnosis of PTSD, his treatment records do not support such a diagnosis.  [One of the Veteran's treatment providers] does identify PTSD as a diagnosis in his therapy notes, but the content of therapy through his notes identify a focus unrelated to PTSD and in many cases focus on the Veteran's current relationship and other current life stressors.\r\n\r\nThe VA examiner goes on to highlight a December 2008 treatment note identifying that the Veteran does not meet the criteria for PTSD.  Furthermore, the VA examiner opines that \"[t]o this point, no psychiatrist identifies sufficient criteria to establish a diagnosis of PTSD.\"  In support of his opinion, the VA examiner notes that the Veteran endorses very few symptoms of PTSD, the content of the Veteran's therapy identifies a focus other than PTSD, and outside of some vague nightmares, no other criteria of PTSD are found in the Veteran's psychiatric treatment records.  In turn, the VA examiner concludes the \"Veteran is less likely than not suffering from PTSD, or any other mental health disorder as a result of his military service or exposure to any military related trauma. \r\n\r\nIn considering whether the Veteran suffers from PTSD, the Board has considered the Veteran's statements, both in conjunction with the current appeal and those to treatment providers, as well as the Veteran-submitted buddy statements, regarding the Veteran's in-service stressors and current symptomatology.  While lay persons are competent to provide evidence on some medical issues, the question of whether the Veteran is suffering specifically from PTSD falls outside the knowledge of the Veteran in this case.  See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 n.4.\r\n\r\nDetermining the specific nature and etiology of an acquired psychiatric disorder requires medical inquiry into internal biological and neurological processes.  Such internal processes are not readily observable and are not within the competence of the Veteran in this case, who has not been shown by the evidence of record to have no medical training or skills.  As a result, the probative value of his lay assertions is low. \r\n\r\nIn light of the competent medical evidence of record, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence of record indicates that the Veteran does not currently have a diagnosis of PTSD.  The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328, 1333 (1997).  Therefore, as the Board has determined that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of PTSD, the claim must be denied and a further discussion of the elements of service connection for PTSD is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nService Connection for an Acquired Psychiatric Disorder Other Than PTSD\r\n\r\nThe Board acknowledges that following a December 2013 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with unspecified depressive disorder.\r\n\r\nWhen a disability is first diagnosed after service, service connection is warranted for that condition if the competent medical evidence shows it was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d). \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records indicate that the Veteran was treated for passive dependent personality disorder and reactive depression with episodic drinking while in service during April 1973.  The Veteran was admitted for two days of hospitalization, diagnosed with passive dependent personality disorder, and recommended for administrative discharge.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, the Veteran's post service medical history includes multiple diagnoses and treatments for depression.  \r\n\r\nAs stated above, the Veteran's current unspecified depressive disorder was diagnosed following an December 2013 VA examination.  The Veteran was again diagnosed with a mild, unspecified depressive disorder at his September 2016 VA examination.  The VA examiner formally diagnosed this depressive disorder, but also determined the \"symptoms are not severe enough either to interfere with occupational and social functioning or to require continuous medication.\"  \r\n\r\nDespite having a current medical disability, and an in-service injury, the competent medical evidence of record does not establish that the Veteran's current unspecified depressive disorder is related to the mental health symptoms and disorder diagnosed during the Veteran's active service.\r\n\r\nIn the December 2013 VA examination, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran's treatment history of depression indicated the onset of emotional and behavioral disturbances during times of financial stress and relationship distress following the Veteran's divorces.  In turn, the VA examiner also concluded it was less likely than not that the Veteran's current unspecified depressive disorder was incurred during the Veteran's active duty. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, following the Veteran's September 2016 VA examination, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran's medical history indicated that no isolated trauma had a lasting impact on the Veteran, and that the Veteran \"continues to be outgoing, enjoying his art, marriage, and a number of social interactions with his only [mental health] difficulties being situational based on current situational stressors.  \r\n\r\nThe VA examiner determined:\r\n\r\nThe Veteran is less likely than not suffering from PTSD or any other mental health disorder as a result of his military service or exposure to any military related trauma.  Furthermore, the Veteran is less likely than not suffering from a personality disorder related to his military service or any past military trauma.  Finally, his current mental health condition is not seen as being aggravated beyond its natural progression by his military service or any reported military trauma/experience.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the probative medical opinion of the VA examiner states that the Veteran does not have a personality disorder.  In turn, it is not necessary to address the presumption of soundness. \r\n\r\nThe Board acknowledges that throughout the appeal period the Veteran has asserted that his unspecified depressive disorder is the result of an isolated traumatic event that occurred while the Veteran was on active duty.  While lay persons are competent to provide evidence on some medical issues, the specific etiology of the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder falls outside the knowledge of a lay person.  See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 n.4.\r\n\r\nDetermining the etiology of an acquired psychiatric disorder requires medical inquiry into internal biological and neurological processes.  Such internal processes are not readily observable and are not within the competence of the Veteran in this case, who has not been shown by the evidence of record to have medical training or skills.  As a result, the probative value of his lay assertions is low. \r\n\r\nThe September 2016 VA examiner's opinions are more probative than the other evidence of record.  The Board concludes that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for service connection for the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).  The benefit of the doubt rule therefore does not apply, and service connection for this disability is not warranted. \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\n  MICHAEL MARTIN\r\nVeterans Law Judge, Board of Veterans' Appeals\r\n\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"5bec3adb8102470b4a111808","name":"1721525.txt","plainText":"Citation Nr: 1721525\t\r\nDecision Date: 06/13/17    Archive Date: 06/23/17\r\n\r\nDOCKET NO.  09-33 787\t)\tDATE\r\n\t)\r\n\t)\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Boston, Massachusetts\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nAppellant represented by:\tDisabled American Veterans\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nPaul Bametzreider, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from April 1960 to March 1964. \r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a February 2008 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Louis, Missouri, with jurisdiction later transferred to the RO in Boston, Massachusetts. \r\n \r\nIn September 2016 the Board remanded the issue for further evidentiary development. The case has now been returned to the Board for further appellate action. \r\n \r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1. The Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\n2. Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, his claimed in-service stressor has been sufficiently corroborated by credible supporting evidence.\r\n\r\n3. Competent and persuasive medical evidence indicates that the Veteran's current PTSD is causally related to his in-service stressor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nResolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107(b) (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 4.125 (2016).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he suffers from PTSD as a result of his active-duty service. Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the current disability and an in-service precipitating disease, injury, or event. 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.\r\n\r\nThere are particular requirements for establishing PTSD in 38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (f) that are separate from those for establishing service connection generally. Arzio v. Shinseki, 602 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Establishing service connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor. 38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (f); see also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997). The sufficiency of a stressor is a medical determination and is presumed by a medical diagnosis of PTSD. Cohen, 10 Vet. App. at 140. If a PTSD claim is based on an in-service personal assault, medical opinion evidence may be submitted for use in determining whether the occurrence of a stressor is corroborated. Menegassi v. Shinseki, 638 F.3d 1379, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2011).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the Board finds that, affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the criteria for establishing service connection for PTSD have been met. See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990) (Under the \"benefit of the doubt\" rule, where there exists an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the veteran shall prevail upon the issue.).\r\n\r\nAt his November 2009 hearing at the Boston, Massachusetts RO, the Veteran asserted that in or around August 1962, he underwent Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape training while stationed in California. The Veteran reported that this training, which was meant to simulate a \"prisoner of war\" scenario, required that he crawl through a wire enclosure while being hit, kicked and verbally accosted. The Veteran asserted that he was knocked down and dragged, and that he was forced to stay in a box for several hours. The Veteran further reported that he began to experience symptoms of PTSD, to include nightmares and sweats, in 1967. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was provided a VA psychiatric examination in December 2010. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD and opined that the reported Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape training was a contributing stressor. The examiner noted that the reported prisoner-of-war simulation was the Veteran's most troubling memory, and that his psychiatric symptoms included distressing recollections of the event and persistent avoidance of thoughts about the trauma. \r\n\r\nA review of the Veteran's military personnel records supports his contention that he underwent Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape training. Specifically, the personnel records indicate that the Veteran attended a six-day \"survival\" school in September 1962. Additionally, the records support that the Veteran was assigned to Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron 11 (VAW-11) from March 1962, which was based at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego, California. \r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the evidence described above, the Board finds that the competent medical evidence of record indicates that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, which is related to his service. The Veteran has provided consistent written lay statements and hearing testimony describing the traumatic experience, and there is nothing in the record to contradict these assertions or that would indicate that the Veteran is not credible. The December 2010 VA examiner provided competent medical evidence indicating that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms were caused by his traumatic experiences in service. See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (f)(5); Menegassi, 638 F.3d at 1382; Cohen, 70 Vet. App. at 140; see also AZ v. Shinseki, 731 F.3d 1303, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Williams, Associate Counsel \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1979 to June 1982.  In addition, she had service in the National Guard from September 1984 to September 1985. \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a November 2009 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Montgomery, Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified at a Travel Board hearing before the undersigned in May 2013.  A transcript of the hearing is associated with the claims files.\r\n\r\nThe Board remanded the claim in November 2013 and November 2016.  \r\nThis appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c) (2016).  38 U.S.C.A. � 7107(a)(2) (West 2014).\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn November 2016, the Board remanded the claim, in pertinent part, for a new VA psychiatric evaluation.  The remand instructions stated that the examiner was to render an opinion as to whether the documented in-service headaches and fainting spells were manifestations of her diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder (to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety).  The examiner was also advised to address the medical literature in the October 2016 Appellate Brief suggesting that fainting and headaches can be physical symptoms of PTSD and can occur as a result of exposure to trauma and the Veteran's September 1980 in-service reports of headaches and fainting spells.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded an additional VA psychiatric evaluation in December 2016.  The examiner noted mental health diagnoses of chronic PTSD with secondary generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder.  Regarding the Veteran's complaints of headaches and fainting spells in service, the examiner stated, \"The Veteran reports multiple pain issues including headaches and back pain.  These issues could be exacerbated by emotional distress but are not directly related.\"  This, however, does not respond to the question as to whether these headaches and fainting spells were manifestations of a current psychiatric disorder.  This statement requires clarification.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Veteran, through her representative, has asserted that her PTSD and depression are caused or aggravated by her service connected migraines.  See June 2017 Appellate Brief.  As the December 2016 opinion does not clearly address this issue, an additional medical opinion is warranted to determine whether the Veteran's PTSD is proximately due to or aggravated by her service-connected migraines.   \r\n\r\n(This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c).  Expedited handling is requested.)\r\n\r\n1.  Obtain a VA addendum opinion by the same December 2016 examiner, (or another appropriate examiner if unavailable), to provide opinions as to whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent or better probability) that the Veteran's PTSD was caused by OR aggravated (i.e., permanently worsened beyond the natural progress of the disorder) by her service-connected migraine headaches.  If aggravation is found, then the examiner should quantify the degree of such aggravation, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe examiner shoulder discuss the medical literature mentioned in the June 2017 Appellate Brief that suggests that migraines are associated with depression.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner must also opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the in-service episodes of fainting and headaches were a manifestation of a currently diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder.\r\n\r\nComplete rationales must be provided for all opinions rendered.  If an opinion cannot be made without resorting to mere speculation, this must also be fully explained.\r\n\r\n2.  Readjudicate the appeal. \r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Allen,  Associate Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from September 1964 to\r\nSeptember 1968.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on\r\nappeal from a March 1992 decision of the Department of Veterans\r\nAffairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Petersburg, Florida,\r\nwhich denied the veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn a March 1993 statement, the veteran's representative made a\r\nclaim that there was clear and unmistakable error in a 1975\r\nrating decision of the RO which severed service connection for an\r\nanxiety neurosis which, in 1972, had been granted as being\r\nsecondary to service-connected shell fragment wound residuals.\r\nThe claim of clear and unmistakable error in the 1975 severance\r\naction has not been adjudicated by the RO; it is not properly\r\nbefore the Board at this time; and it is referred to the RO for\r\nappropriate action.\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD is well\r\ngrounded, meaning not inherently implausible, and the file\r\nindicates there is a further VA duty to assist him in developing\r\nfacts pertinent to that claim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a) (West\r\n1991); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303(a), 3.159 (1993).\r\n\r\nThe RO has not had the opportunity to apply a recently enacted\r\nregulation concerning claims for service connection for PTSD.\r\nThat regulation, 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), provides that service\r\nconnection for PTSD requires medical evidence of a clear\r\ndiagnosis of the condition, credible supporting evidence that the\r\nclaimed in-service stressor actually occurred, and a link,\r\nestablished by medical evidence, between current symptomatology\r\nand the claimed in-service stressor.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the validity of a stressor, if it is not related\r\nto combat with the enemy, it must be corroborated by service\r\nmedical records or other credible supporting evidence.  Zarycki\r\nv. Brown, 6 Vet.App. 91 (1993); Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet.App. 283\r\n(1994).  Although the veteran apparently alleges combat service,\r\nand told stories of combat to the psychiatrist at the VA\r\ncompensation examination in January 1992, there is no probative\r\nevidence of combat participation.  The veteran served on active\r\nduty in the Air Force, and his overseas service during the\r\nVietnam War was at an air base in Thailand, performing duties of\r\nan air traffic controller.  Service records show no medals or\r\nother information suggesting combat service.  Of course, a valid\r\nstressor for PTSD does not have to involve combat.  The veteran's\r\nservice records document a potential non-combat stressor; gunshot\r\nwounds sustained while riding his motorcycle on authorized\r\nliberty in Thailand (residuals of the wounds are service-\r\nconnected).  Medical evidence of linkage between this event and\r\nany clearly diagnosed PTSD would be required for service\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nMedical records since service, including recent ones, primarily\r\nshow psychiatric diagnoses other than PTSD.  The January 1992 VA\r\ncompensation examination led to diagnoses of schizophrenia and\r\nPTSD, but there is some question as to whether the examiner\r\nconsidered all diagnostic criteria for PTSD as set forth in DSM-\r\nIII-R (See 38 C.F.R. � 4.126), and the examination shows no clear\r\nassessment of medical causation between verified service\r\nstressors and purported PTSD.  While some recent outpatient\r\nrecords briefly refer to PTSD (in addition to schizophrenia),\r\nthere are many recent inpatient and outpatient records which only\r\nshow schizophrenia and give no indication of PTSD.  See, e.g.,\r\nNovember 1992 report of VA psychological testing, and summary of\r\nNovember-December 1992 VA hospitalization.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment, a special VA psychiatric examination, by a board\r\nof two psychiatrist, is warranted on the question of whether PTSD\r\nexists and whether it is linked to a service stressor.\r\n\r\nThe examination should review all historical records.  The file\r\nindicates that additional relevant records may exist, and these\r\nshould first be obtained.  Murincsak v. Derwinski, 2 Vet.App. 363\r\n(1992).  In this regard, correspondence on file indicates that\r\nthe veteran receives ongoing VA psychiatric treatment; he has\r\napparently filed for Social Security disability benefits; and\r\nthere is information that he may be receiving disability\r\nretirement benefits from a Federal Civil Service job (air traffic\r\ncontroller with the Federal Aviation Administration) due to a\r\nmental disorder.\r\n\r\nIn view of the foregoing, the case is REMANDED for the following\r\naction:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should ask the veteran to\r\nidentify all sources of psychiatric\r\ntreatment or examination since service.\r\nNames and addresses of medical providers,\r\nand dates of services should be listed.\r\nThe RO should obtain copies of all relevant\r\nmedical records identified by the veteran,\r\nincluding ongoing VA treatment records\r\ndated after the ones currently on file.\r\n\r\n2.  The RO should contact the U.S. Office\r\nof Personnel Management (or other\r\nappropriate office) and obtain copies of\r\nall medical records and decisions related\r\nto any award of Federal Civil Service\r\ndisability retirement benefits.  The RO\r\nshould also contact the Social Security\r\nAdministration and obtain copies of medical\r\nrecords and decisions related to an\r\napplication for disability benefits from\r\nthat agency.\r\n\r\n3.  After the foregoing is accomplished and\r\nthe records added to the claims folder, the\r\nveteran should undergo a VA psychiatric\r\nexamination by a board of two\r\npsychiatrists.  The claims folder must be\r\nmade available to, and its contents\r\nreviewed by, the doctors.  Psychological\r\ntesting should be provided.  The examiners\r\nshould note all psychiatric conditions, and\r\nshould specifically diagnose or rule out\r\nPTSD in accordance to the diagnostic\r\ncriteria of DSM-III-R; the doctors should\r\nspecify the purported stressor(s) felt to\r\nbe medically linked to any PTSD which is\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n4.  Thereafter, the RO should review the\r\nclaim for service connection for PTSD, and\r\nthis should include consideration of 38\r\nC.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nIf the claim is denied, the veteran and his representative should\r\nbe issued a supplemental statement of the case and given an\r\nopportunity to respond.  Then the case should be returned to the\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n          L. W.

Gutstein, Counsel \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nINTRODUCTION \r\n \r\nThe veteran served on active duty from August 1964 to August \r\n1968, and from June 1971 to December 1977.  He filed an \r\nappeal from the October 1992 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Manchester, New \r\nHampshire, Regional Office (RO), which denied service \r\nconnection for PTSD.  The veteran filed a notice of \r\ndisagreement in December 1992, and he was furnished a \r\nstatement of the case in April 1993.  He filed a substantive \r\nappeal in May 1993.  He and his wife were afforded a hearing \r\nat the RO before a traveling member of the Board in \r\nSeptember 1993.  The case was remanded by letter in April \r\n1994.  The veteran is represented in his appeal by the \r\nDisabled American Veterans, which has submitted written \r\nargument in his behalf. \r\n \r\nAt the veteran's personal hearing, it was stated that he \r\nwished to file a notice of disagreement from the rating \r\ndecision of November 1992 in which 10 percent ratings were \r\ncontinued for service-connected chronic strain of the \r\ncervical and dorsal spine and for chronic low back strain \r\nwith osteoarthritis. It was also reported that the veteran \r\nwished to file a claim for service connection for a \r\ngastrointestinal disorder.  The case was sent back to the RO \r\nin April 1994 for the purpose of dealing with those issues.  \r\nHowever, a subsequent letter from the veteran that month \r\nrequested that his case be returned to the Board for the \r\npurpose of having the issue of service connection for PTSD \r\ncompleted.  Accordingly, the other issues, which are not in \r\nappellate status, are referred to the attention of the RO \r\nfor appropriate action. \r\n \r\n \r\nCONTENTIONS OF APPELLANT ON APPEAL \r\n \r\nIt is argued that the veteran developed PTSD while stationed \r\nin Vietnam when his base was attacked by the enemy,and \r\npersonnel at the base were killed, with this experience \r\nrepresenting life-threatening stressors.  As a result, it is \r\nfurther argued that the veteran was diagnosed after service \r\nas having PTSD, resulting in recurrent nightmares, anxiety, \r\ngastrointestinal reactions, and difficulty in concentrating \r\nat his work. \r\nDECISION OF THE BOARD \r\n \r\nThe Board, in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 7104 (West 1991), has reviewed and considered all of the \r\nevidence and material of record in the veteran's claims \r\nfile.  Based on its review of the evidence in this matter, \r\nand for the following reasons and bases, it is the decision \r\nof the Board that service connection for PTSD is warranted. \r\n \r\n \r\nFINDINGS OF FACT \r\n \r\n1.  The veteran served in Vietnam at an air base in which \r\nstressful events, including enemy attacks with resulting \r\nloss of life, occurred. \r\n \r\n2.  Early in December 1966, his base was under siege from \r\nsmall arms fire and mortars followed by infiltration at the \r\nwork site by the enemy throwing satchel charges, while the \r\nveteran was without a weapon to defend himself. \r\n \r\n3.  The veteran's feeling of helplessness when under enemy \r\nattack in Vietnam because his MOS was not allowed to carry \r\nweapons was considered a legitimate stressor which served as \r\na basis for a PTSD diagnosis by a VA examiner in November \r\n1992.   \r\n \r\n4.  The veteran has been medically treated for PTSD with \r\nsymptoms of anxiety and depression, requiring constant \r\nmedication, with manifestations of nightmares and sleep \r\ndisturbance, difficulty concentrating and other behavioral \r\ndisorders including withdrawal from society. \r\n \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW \r\n \r\nPTSD was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107(b) \r\n(West 1991); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d)(f) (1994). \r\n \r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION \r\n \r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by wartime \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 1991).   \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d) (1994) provides that satisfactory lay \r\nor other evidence that an injury or disease was incurred or \r\naggravated in combat will be accepted as sufficient proof of \r\nservice connection if the evidence is consistent with the \r\ncircumstances, conditions or hardships of such service even \r\nthough there is no official record of such incurrence or \r\naggravation.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1994) provides that \r\nservice connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\nestablishing a clear diagnosis of the condition, credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed inservice stressor \r\nactually occurred and a link, established by medical \r\nevidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed \r\ninservice stressor. \r\n \r\nThe evidence in this case shows that the veteran served on \r\nactive duty from August 1964 to August 1968 during which \r\ntime he served almost 12 months in Vietnam, and from June \r\n1971 to December 1977.  The records otherwise show that the \r\nveteran's classification was as an aircraft and jet engine \r\nmechanic and that he engaged in the Vietnam air offensive \r\ncampaign from September 1966 to March 1967 stationed at Tan \r\nSon Nhut Airbase.  The length of his foreign service was \r\nfrom September 1966 to September 1967.  In connection with \r\nhis claim, the veteran submitted copies of newspaper \r\narticles showing raids on Tan Son Nhut Air Base by the Viet \r\nCong with mortars.  A report from the United States Army and \r\nJoint Services Environmental Support Group (ESG) dated in \r\nOctober 1992 confirms that on December 4, 1966, the above-\r\ncited air base suffered a hostile mortar attack and as a \r\nresult 27 airmen were injured and three were killed.  Also \r\nenclosed with this report were abstracts of reports \r\nindicating the dates of attacks on this air base during the \r\nveteran's Vietnam tour of duty and that during the December \r\n4, 1966, attack 20 aircraft were damaged. \r\n \r\nThe veteran filed a claim for service connection for PTSD in \r\nDecember 1991.  Subsequent medical reports show VA \r\noutpatient treatment for anxiety and depression in the early \r\n1990's.  A VA psychiatric examination report in August 1992 \r\nshowed that the veteran had prior employment at a naval \r\nshipyard until 1986 and that he had difficulties with his \r\nco-workers and quit with no gainful employment since then.  \r\nHe reported a history of diarrhea for 25 years, \r\nrestlessness, nervousness, inability to concentrate, \r\nnightmares about Vietnam, becoming easily angry, irritable, \r\nlight sleep only and alerted by noises, overreactive, easily \r\njumpy, occasionally depressed and avoidance of people.  \r\nObjectively, he appeared tense, his speech was somewhat \r\nunder pressure, his posture was somewhat stiff and he was \r\nnot able to relax completely throughout the examination.  \r\nHis facial expression showed some tension and anxiety.  The \r\nexa.miner diagnosed moderately severe PTSD.  It was noted \r\nthat he was intensely psychologically distressed at exposure \r\nto events that verbalized or resembled aspects of the \r\ntraumatic event which was being overrun by 300 Viet Cong and \r\nnot having weapons to defend himself; fear of being shot at \r\nand a feeling of helplessness.  He avoided thoughts or \r\nfeelings associated with the trauma and avoided activities \r\nand situations that aroused recollections.  He had markedly \r\ndiminished interest in significant activities.  He had lost \r\ninterest in his hobbies of fishing and hunting.  He was \r\nsocially isolated and felt somewhat detached.  He had a \r\nstartle reflex and a light sleep to be \"on alert.\"  He \r\nsuffered from irritability or outbursts of anger and \r\nexaggerated startle response. \r\n \r\nOn a subsequent VA psychiatric examination conducted in \r\nNovember 1992, the veteran complained of increased anxiety \r\nand depression since service but had considered this \r\n\"normal\" and had avoided seeking help.  He finally sought \r\nhelp at the mental hygiene clinic.  He described his most \r\ntraumatic episode in Vietnam as being when the Viet Cong \r\ntunneled under the perimeter and infiltrated his base.  He \r\nwas in a bunker and saw a number of the enemy go by.  What \r\nwas most distressing to him of all was that he was unarmed \r\nbecause of Air Force policy that servicemen in his position \r\nshould not carry weapons, but instead were to be protected \r\nby the Air Force police.  As the infiltration was occurring, \r\nhe recalled that the enemy fired mortar rounds from within \r\nthe compound.  He saw a number of GI's crying, and others \r\ndrinking to calm down.  He said he was not really too scared \r\nuntil the sun came up at which time he saw the bodies of \r\nseveral enemy dead, collected during the night's activities, \r\nwhich upset him greatly.  He also described other traumatic \r\nevents during his service in Vietnam as having to walk by \r\nthe morgue on his way to the chow hall and seeing American \r\ndead piled up on the tables.  This sight made him lose his \r\nappetite and his weight went down from 190 to 155 pounds.  \r\nThe examiner concluded that the veteran had recollections of \r\nan event in Vietnam during which he legitimately appeared to \r\nhave felt quite helpless, apparently serving as a basis for \r\nthe PTSD diagnosis. \r\n \r\nThe veteran testified at his September 1993 personal hearing \r\nconcerning the service events in Vietnam, described above, \r\nand post service events including a record of current \r\ntreatment for PTSD every two weeks.  He was taking various \r\nmedications for his psychiatric disability and for other \r\nproblems.  His wife also testified indicating his strange \r\nbehavior including the fact that the veteran has had \r\nrecurrent diarrhea, she witnessed his nightmares, reported \r\nhe kept loaded weapons in the house including one under the \r\nbed, and that after an episode of nightmares, he would lock \r\nhimself in his bedroom. \r\n \r\nAlso received in September 1993 were statements in support \r\nof the veteran's claim including one from R. F. R., a \r\n\"buddy\" of the veteran who knew him before service and also \r\nknew him overseas in Vietnam.  He knew that the veteran \r\nworked on the flight line on the midnight shift and recalled \r\non the night of December 3 and morning of December 4, 1966, \r\nthe base was attacked with mortars, satchel charges, \r\ngrenades and sappers which had infiltrated across the \r\nrunway.  He saw the veteran after the attack and the veteran \r\nseemed a bit shaken but was mad because he did not have a \r\nweapon during the attack.  He showed R. F. R. the bunker he \r\nwas in, right in the midst of where the Viet Cong were \r\nkilled.  You could still see the blood on the cement of the \r\nflight line.  Another statement from L. M. H., also received \r\nat the same time, concerned his knowledge of the veteran's \r\nexperiencing diarrhea and an inability to control himself \r\nwhen visiting L. M. H.'s home in May 1973.  The veteran \r\nexplained that he got that way when he was under stress. \r\n \r\nIn the United States Court of Veterans Appeals (Court) \r\ndecision of Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet.App. 91 (1993), the \r\nCourt noted that it is the distressing event rather than the \r\nmere presence in a \"combat zone\" which may constitute a \r\nvalid stressor for purposes of supporting a diagnosis of \r\nPTSD.  It emphasized the importance of an event during such \r\nservice \"that is outside of the range of usual experience \r\nand that would be markedly distressing to almost anyone,\" \r\nsuch as experiencing an immediate threat to one's life or \r\nwitnessing another person being seriously injured or killed.  \r\nIn the case at hand, the veteran has described an event \r\nwhere the enemy attacked an air base where the veteran was \r\nstationed at night in early December 1966 with resulting \r\nloss of considerable life of the enemy as well as the \r\nwounding of American soldiers and the death of at least \r\nthree soldiers, and damage to the air field.  In such event, \r\nthe veteran experienced stressful events because he was \r\nunarmed, and apparently angry and scared that he was unable \r\nto defend himself, with the situation later magnified by \r\nviewing of both American and enemy dead in a place set aside \r\nfor a mortuary.  The official service records have indicated \r\nthat this was a combat zone for the period from September \r\n1966 to September 1967 and the veteran has indicated that he \r\nwas otherwise subject to stressful attacks from the enemy.  \r\nHis description of the events has been confirmed by a \r\n\"buddy\" of his.

All relevant evidence necessary for an equitable \r\ndisposition of the veteran�s appeal has been obtained by the \r\nRO.\r\n\r\n2.  The veteran has not been shown to have PTSD that has been \r\nlinked to an adequate stressor(s) during military service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe veteran does not have post�traumatic stress disorder \r\nwhich was incurred in or aggravated by military service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107 (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, \r\n3.304 (1994).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFactual Background\r\n\r\nThe veteran�s service medical records show that in June 1967, \r\nwhile waiting for a hardship discharge, he complained of \r\nproblems with depression.  There was no further complaint \r\nthroughout the remainder of his period of service.  His \r\nAugust 1967 discharge examination report includes a notation \r\nof �normal� for his psychiatric condition.  During his two \r\nmonths of service in Vietnam, he served as a telephone \r\nswitchboard operator and an observer.\r\n\r\nThe veteran filed a claim for service connection in July \r\n1992.  The RO sent a letter in which it requested that he \r\ndescribe the circumstances, places, and dates surrounding the \r\nevents which he believed led to the development of post�\r\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  No response which included \r\nthe requested information was received from the veteran.\r\n\r\nAn October 1968 report from Chandra P. Lal, M.D., was \r\nsubmitted which includes a diagnosis of an adjustment \r\nreaction of early adult�life.  This report reveals that he \r\nhad been admitted to the psychiatric service following an \r\nepisode when he drank heavily and was involved in an \r\nautomobile accident.\r\n\r\nA November 1974 VA discharge summary, included a diagnosis of \r\n�alcohol addiction, chronic� and a statement that he had \r\npreviously been admitted in October 1973, for alcohol \r\naddiction.  A March 1976 discharge summary included a \r\ndiagnosis of adult situational reaction and alcohol \r\naddiction.  The veteran was evaluated as being competent and \r\nnot psychotic.\r\n\r\nPrison hospital records were submitted which include a \r\nFebruary 1975 entry of acute anxiety; a March 1975 notation \r\nof combat�fatigue; several statements that he appeared tense \r\nand uptight; as well as a January 1987 notation that he was \r\nmentally exhausted and getting no sleep.\r\n\r\nA July 1992 VA hospital report included a notation that he \r\nclaimed that he was beset by marked, constant anger following \r\nhis return from Vietnam and that he drinks to control his \r\nbehavior.  It was noted that the veteran denied any combat \r\nrelated symptoms and repressed most Vietnam�related \r\nexperiences.  He was reported as appearing mildly depressed.  \r\nHe was admitted because of alcohol abuse.  The veteran left \r\nthe hospital after becoming upset.  He was diagnosed with \r\n�alcohol dependency, continuous�; �alcohol \r\nintoxication/withdrawal�; and a mixed personality disorder \r\nwith antisocial and explosive features.\r\n\r\nThe veteran was readmitted at the end of July 1992.  The \r\ndischarge summary included a diagnosis of alcohol \r\ndependence/withdrawal; chronic alcoholism; and probable PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated in August 1992, the veteran�s wife stated \r\nthat he experienced flashbacks, thinking that he was in the \r\nrice patties and that they were after him.  She claimed that \r\nhe had nightmares and sometimes would cry, thinking that his \r\n�buddy just got killed beside him.�  Forms dated in September \r\n1992, were also received which the veteran�s wife, friend, \r\nmother, and daughter submitted as part of his claim for \r\nSocial Security benefits.  These forms include answers to \r\nspecific questions concerning the manner in which the veteran \r\nconducted himself and some of the behaviors that he \r\ndisplayed.  His mother stated that she first began to notice \r\nchanges in his behavior, following his separation from the \r\nmilitary.  His wife noted changes after he returned from \r\nprison.\r\n\r\nA November 1992 VA examination report shows that the veteran \r\nstated that he had been involved in three patrols, while he \r\nwas stationed in Vietnam.  The examiner reported that the \r\ndetails of combat which the veteran related were very \r\nsketchy.  The veteran is reported as having stated that he \r\nwas involved in a firefight during the first patrol and that \r\nfour men were either killed or wounded, but that he did not \r\nknow any of the individuals involved.  He reported that \r\nduring the second patrol, a man was wounded and later died of \r\nhis injuries.  His third patrol was interrupted when he was \r\nremoved from combat as a �sole�surviving son� and was placed \r\non guard duty, before returning to the United States.  He \r\nstated that this guard duty did not involve any threat to his \r\nlife.  He stated that he neither has memories of, nor does he \r\nthink about Vietnam.  The examiner reported that he did not \r\nfind any evidence of delusions or psychotic symptomatology \r\nand the veteran did not report experiencing hallucinations.  \r\nThe veteran was extremely irritable and had great difficulty \r\ncontrolling his anger, which the examiner reported resulted \r\nin the antisocial behavior that was responsible for his being \r\nincarcerated throughout much of his adult�life.  The veteran \r\nblamed his antisocial behavior and his inability to hold a \r\njob, on the experiences to which he was exposed during the \r\nmilitary service.  He was diagnosed with �alcohol dependency, \r\ncontinuous� and a mixed personality disorder with antisocial \r\nand explosive features.\r\n\r\nA November 1992 report from William E. Mills, Jr., Ph.D., \r\nwhich was conducted as part a claim for Social Security \r\nbenefits, reveals that the veteran established himself as an \r\nangry, belligerent, and totally impatient individual.  He was \r\nreported as experiencing immense difficulty in getting along \r\nwith people and had displayed virtually no tolerance for any \r\nfrustration.  No stressful events from service were noted.  \r\nThe examiner related that it was difficult to sort out some \r\nof his symptoms and there was not a clear indication of PTSD.  \r\nHe stated that there were no clear signs of depression, \r\nanxiety, or any other psychotic material.  He diagnosed the \r\nveteran with an antisocial personality disorder and alcohol \r\ndependence.\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the veteran has presented a well�\r\ngrounded claim for service connection for post�traumatic \r\nstress disorder (PTSD), within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5107(a) (1994).  The record shows that the veteran served \r\nin Vietnam and evidence has been received which includes a \r\nnotation of a probable diagnosis of PTSD.  As a result, the \r\nevidence currently of record presents a claim that is not \r\ninherently implausible.  After reviewing the remainder of the \r\nrecord, the Board finds that all of the facts that are \r\nrelevant to the veteran�s claim have been properly developed.  \r\nThere is no indication that other records are available which \r\nare relevant to the current claim of service connection.  As \r\na result, nothing further is required pursuant to the duty to \r\nassist the veteran, as mandated by 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a) \r\n(1994).\r\n\r\nService connection will be granted when a veteran suffers \r\nfrom a disability that is related to an occurrence of service \r\norigin.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 \r\n(1994).  To service�connect post�traumatic stress disorder \r\n(PTSD) it must be shown that the veteran currently suffers \r\nfrom the disorder, and that resulted from his exposure to \r\nadequate stressor(s) during it military service.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 1110 (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304(f) (1994).  To \r\nestablish the necessary linkage to an individual�s military \r\nservice, the record must include credible evidence which \r\nverifies the actual occurrence of the inservice stressor(s) \r\nthat are determined as having led to the development of PTSD.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1994).  The Board has carefully \r\nconsidered all of the evidence of record and finds that while \r\nPTSD was suspected, it has not currently been diagnosed as \r\nbeing present.\r\n\r\nThe reports from two separate admissions to the hospital in \r\nJuly 1992, include questions regarding the presence of PTSD.  \r\nHowever, a VA psychiatric examination was subsequently \r\nconducted in November 1992 and the examiner noted a history \r\nof combat experience, but did not diagnose PTSD.  Instead, he \r\ndiagnosed the veteran with alcohol dependence and a mixed \r\npersonality disorder with explosive features.  The veteran \r\nwas also referred for a psychological examination for Social \r\nSecurity disability benefits in November 1992.  No stressful \r\nevents were described as having been reported during the \r\ncourse of this interview and the examiner stated that there \r\nwas not a clear indication of PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe Board has carefully considered all the evidence of record \r\nand finds that while PTSD was suspected it has not been \r\ndiagnosed to be present.  The VA psychiatric examination in \r\nNovember 1992 noted the veteran�s history of combat \r\nexperiences, but did not diagnosis PTSD.  The diagnoses \r\nconcerned alcohol dependency and a mixed personality disorder \r\nwith explosive features.  The veteran was also referred for a \r\npsychological evaluation for disability benefits in November \r\n1992.  No stressful events were described and the examiner \r\nreported that there was not a clear indication of PTSD.  the \r\nBoard concludes that the veteran is not shown to currently \r\nhave PTSD as the result of service.\r\n\r\nWe have considered the doctrine of giving the benefit of the \r\ndoubt to the veteran under 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107 and 38 C.F.R. \r\n�� 3.102, 4.3 (1994), but do not find the evidence is of such \r\napproximate balance as to warrant its application.  The \r\npreponderance of the evidence is against the veteran�s claim.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nThe veteran�s claim of service connection for post�traumatic \r\nstress disorder denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tSTEVEN L.

H. Wetmore, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from September 1968 to May \r\n1970.  \r\n\r\nThe Board of Veterans� Appeals (Board) received this case on \r\nappeal from a May 1993 RO rating decision.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTIONS OF APPELLANT ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that he has PTSD due to his combat \r\nexperiences in Vietnam.  He claims that he has submitted \r\nseveral statements from private doctors, a clinical social \r\nworker and members of his therapy group which all show that \r\nhe did experience the stressors he claims to have experienced \r\nwhile in combat.  He asserts that his account of the \r\nstressors is credible, that he did serve in combat and that \r\nPTSD has been diagnosed; therefore, service connection should \r\nbe granted.  \r\n\r\n\r\nDECISION OF THE BOARD\r\n\r\nThe Board, in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 7104 (West 1991 & Supp. 1995), has reviewed and considered \r\nall of the evidence and material of record in the veteran's \r\nclaims file.  Based on its review of the relevant evidence in \r\nthis matter, and for the following reasons and bases, it is \r\nthe decision of the Board that the evidence supports the \r\nclaim of service connection for PTSD.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  It is reasonably probable that the veteran was in combat \r\nwith the enemy.  \r\n\r\n2.  The evidence of record presents a reasonable probability \r\nthat the veteran�s current PTSD is related to his combat \r\nexperiences in Vietnam.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe veteran has PTSD which was incurred in wartime service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107(a) (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, \r\n3.303, 3.304 (1995).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe veteran�s service medical records are negative for \r\nclinically documented complaints or findings of an acquired \r\npsychiatric disorder.  A personality disorder was diagnosed \r\nin service in April 1970.  The veteran�s service personnel \r\nrecords reveal that he served in Vietnam from July 1969 to \r\nMay 1970.  His military occupational specialty was that of a \r\ncook.\r\n\r\nThe veteran has provided an extensive description of \r\nstressful events in service, which, if deemed credible would \r\nsupport a finding that he engaged in combat with the enemy.  \r\nHowever, they were not considered specific enough for \r\nverification by the U.S. Army and Joint Services \r\nEnvironmental Support Group (ESG).  The failure to verify \r\nmuch of what the veteran reported was due, in part, to the \r\nfact that the Vietnam records were incomplete.  In any event \r\nthe ESG did report that the veteran�s battalion did receive \r\nthe Meritorious Unit Commendation and that the battalion \r\nprovided critical combat service support in the Mekong Delta.  \r\nThe boats were subject to ambushes and mining incidents while \r\ntraveling the Delta�s narrow canals and rivers.  Seven unit \r\npersonnel were killed in action.  One of the companies to \r\nwhich the veteran was assigned operated landing craft for the \r\nmovement of personnel and cargo in the Mekong Delta, and \r\nthese vessels were equipped with machine guns and grenade \r\nlaunchers.\r\n\r\nP. A. Lyons, a clinical social worker, reported in January \r\n1992 that the veteran had been initially seen in November \r\n1991 due to complaints of sleep disturbance and nightmares of \r\nVietnam.  He felt that the veteran was probably suffering \r\nfrom PTSD.  \r\n\r\nC. M. Livingston, M. D., reported in May 1992 that she had \r\nfirst seen the veteran in January 1992 on referral from Mr. \r\nLyons, a Vietnam outreach counselor.  She opined that he had \r\nPTSD secondary to his �Vietnam related combat.�\r\n\r\nAt a VA social survey conducted in May 1992, the veteran \r\nrelated stressors which included being in �firefights�, \r\nassisting a wounded American who died in his arms, observing \r\nViet Cong prisoners being pushed out of a plane, witnessing a \r\nburning village after a Viet Cong attack, smelling death, \r\nseeing charred bodies and seeing �buddies killed.�\r\n\r\nAt a VA psychiatric examination in May 1992, the examiner \r\nconcluded that the veteran�s psychiatric symptomatology \r\nseemed to date back to 1970 and that it had gotten worse \r\nsince 1991, during the period of �Desert Storm.�  The present \r\nsymptoms were deemed consistent with PTSD, and that was the \r\ndiagnosis.  \r\n\r\nIn May 1992, Mr. Lyons wrote that the veteran had PTSD.  That \r\nmonth, Dr. Livingston wrote that the veteran had PTSD due to \r\nhis combat experience in Vietnam.  In June 1992, J. Alpert, \r\nM.D., concluded that the veteran had PTSD due to Vietnam \r\ncombat.  \r\n\r\nDr. Livingston reported in October 1993 that the veteran had \r\nPTSD.  \r\n\r\nIn January 1994, Mr. Lyons and four others, identified as \r\nmembers of a Vietnam Veteran�s Adjustment Group therapy \r\nprogram since June 1992, signed a statement to the effect \r\nthat they believed the veteran had PTSD due to his combat \r\nexperiences in Vietnam.  \r\n\r\nIn summary, every health care professional on record in this \r\ncase has diagnosed PTSD.  There is no dispute whatsoever \r\nabout the psychiatric diagnosis.  The Board finds that the \r\nveteran engaged in combat with the enemy.  The veteran�s \r\nlocation in the Mekong Delta coupled with what is reported by \r\nthe ESG, at very least raises a reasonable doubt as to this \r\npoint.  Such doubt is resolved in the veteran�s favor.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5107 (b), 38 C.F.R. � 3.102.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is a unanimity of medical opinion as to the \r\nfact that the veteran has PTSD which is due to his combat \r\nexperiences.  Under these circumstances, the Board concludes \r\nthat service connection for PTSD is warranted.  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is granted.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tBRUCE E.

The substantive appeal, however, submitted \r\nin a timely fashion and signed by the veteran, was limited to \r\nthe issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  In \r\nthe absence of a substantive appeal regarding the other \r\ndisabilities originally claimed, the Board of Veterans� \r\nAppeals (Board) has no jurisdiction over these issues and \r\nwill not address them further herein.  38 C.F.R. �� 20.200, \r\n20.202.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that service connection is warranted for \r\nPTSD.  He asserts he experienced traumatic events during his \r\nVietnam service and has suffered anxiety, nightmares, and \r\nthoughts of combat since discharge.\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\nestablishing a clear diagnosis of the condition, credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed inservice stressor \r\nactually occurred, and a link between current symptomatology \r\nand the claimed inservice stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) \r\n(1995).  In Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet.App. 91 at 97 (1993), the \r\nUnited States Court of Veterans Appeals (Court) explained \r\nthat if the veteran engaged in combat and the claimed \r\nstressor is related to combat, no further development for \r\nevidence of a stressor is necessary.  Where, however, the VA \r\ndetermines that the veteran did not engage in combat with the \r\nenemy, or that the veteran did engage in combat with the \r\nenemy but the claimed stressor is not related to such combat, \r\nthe veteran�s lay testimony and/or written contentions, by \r\nthemselves, will not be enough to establish the occurrence of \r\nthe alleged stressor.  Instead, the record must contain \r\nservice records which corroborate the veteran�s testimony as \r\nto the occurrence of the claimed stressor.  West v. Brown, \r\n7 Vet.App. 70 (1994).  The Court has held that the Board is \r\nnot bound to accept the diagnosis of PTSD if the evidence of \r\nrecord does not objectively support that diagnosis.  Wood v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet.App. 406 (1991).\r\n\r\nThe veteran�s service personnel records are not in his claims \r\nfile.  These records are necessary to corroborate the \r\nveteran�s reported assignments during service.  None of the \r\nevents claimed to have been a stressor during service has \r\nbeen completely verified.  As outlined above, if the veteran \r\nparticipated in combat and the stressor is related to combat, \r\nno further development is necessary.  Upon remand, then, it \r\nmust be determined whether the veteran participated in \r\ncombat.  If not, further evidentiary development to \r\ncorroborate the veteran�s contentions will be necessary.  In \r\nthis regard, it is important to note that some of the events \r\nwhich the veteran claims occurred during service and which \r\ncontinue to haunt him, such as the rape and beating of a \r\nVietnamese girl, and his involvement with drugs during \r\nservice are most likely unverifiable and if true, would have \r\nconstituted misconduct on his part.  Service connection may \r\nbe granted only when a disability was not the result of the \r\nveteran�s own willful misconduct.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 105, 1110; \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.301(a).  \r\n\r\nThe veteran reports receiving psychiatric treatment from a \r\nDr. Jablin soon after his discharge from service.  Apparently \r\nhe was prescribed the drug Ritalin for symptoms of \r\nhyperactivity.  Records reflecting the veteran�s mental \r\nhealth proximate to service could be very probative on his \r\nclaim.\r\n\r\nFollowing this development, the RO should review the record \r\nto determine whether the facts supporting the veteran�s claim \r\nare materially different.  If the fact scenario has changed \r\nsignificantly, another VA psychiatric examination may be \r\nwarranted.  The report of the January 1994 VA examination \r\nshows that the examination was particularly thorough, as it \r\nlasted for three sessions, covering a total of six hours of \r\ninterviews with the veteran.  The report itself is quite \r\ncomprehensive, covering the veteran�s history and mental \r\nstatus in depth.  In order to conserve administrative and \r\njudicial resources, the Board is of the opinion that unless \r\nfurther evidence is uncovered which would change the \r\nexaminer�s understanding of the veteran�s history and \r\nbackground, an additional examination will not be necessary. \r\n\r\nTo ensure that the VA has met its duty to assist the claimant \r\nin developing the facts pertinent to the claim and to ensure \r\nfull compliance with due process requirements, the case is \r\nREMANDED to the RO for the following development:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should obtain copies of the \r\nveteran's complete service personnel \r\nfile.\r\n2.  The RO should obtain the names and \r\naddresses of all medical care providers \r\nwho have treated the veteran for any \r\npsychiatric disorder since his discharge \r\nfrom service, including Dr. Jablin.  \r\nAfter securing any necessary release(s), \r\nthe RO should obtain complete clinical \r\nrecords of all such this treatment.\r\n\r\n3.  The RO should obtain all records of \r\nVA medical treatment afforded to the \r\nveteran which are not contained in his \r\nclaims file.\r\n\r\n4.  The RO should make a formal \r\ndetermination as to whether the veteran \r\nengaged in combat for the purposes of \r\nevaluating his claimed PTSD stressors.  \r\nIf so, no further development regarding \r\nthe veteran�s claimed stressors need be \r\nundertaken.  If not, the RO should \r\nverify, through official channels, all \r\nstressor events which do not involve \r\nmisconduct on the part of the veteran.\r\n\r\n5.  If the veteran�s claimed stressor is \r\nverified, as required by West v. Brown, \r\n7 Vet.App. 70 (1994), the RO must \r\ndetermine whether another VA examination \r\nto clarify the nature and etiology of the \r\nveteran�s psychiatric disability is \r\nnecessary.  If the facts surrounding the \r\nveteran�s stressor events and psychiatric \r\nsymptomatology have changed \r\nsignificantly, then another psychiatric \r\nexamination is likely warranted.  If so, \r\nsuch an examination should be scheduled.\r\n\r\n6.  After the development requested above \r\nis completed, the RO should again review \r\nthe record.  If the benefit sought \r\nremains denied, the appellant and his \r\nrepresentative should be furnished a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case and \r\ngiven the opportunity to respond.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the case should be returned to the Board, if in \r\norder.  The Board intimates no opinion as to the ultimate \r\noutcome of this case.  The appellant need take no action \r\nunless otherwise notified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tGEORGE R.

[redacted]\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nG. Wm. Thompson, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active military service from March 1968 to \r\nOctober 1969.  His awards and decorations include the Fleet \r\nMarine Force Combat Operation Insignia for service with the \r\nU.S. Naval Mobile Construction Battalion TWENTY-TWO during \r\nthe period August 31, 1968 to March 3, 1969.  The letter no-\r\ntifying the veteran of this award dated in November 1968 \r\nstates that it is for �service performed in the combat zone.�  \r\nHe has no awards or decorations specific to combat.\r\n\r\nThe Board, in a decision in January 1991 denied service con-\r\nnection for PTSD.  In an April 1993 rating action the RO \r\nfound that new and material evidence had been submitted to \r\nreopen the veteran�s claim for service connection for PTSD; \r\nhowever, service connection was still denied.  The case was \r\nremanded for additional development in June 1995, and has \r\nbeen returned to the Board for further appellate considera-\r\ntion.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTIONS OF APPELLANT ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends, in essence, that the RO erred in not \r\nfinding that he evidence of record supports service connec-\r\ntion for post-traumatic stress syndrome.  \r\n\r\n\r\nDECISION OF THE BOARD\r\n\r\nThe Board, in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 7104 (West 1991 & Supp. 1995), has reviewed and considered \r\nall of the evidence and material of record in the veteran's \r\nclaims file.  Based on its review of the relevant evidence in \r\nthis matter, and for the following reasons and bases, it is \r\nthe decision of the Board that the preponderance of the evi-\r\ndence does not provide a basis for service connection for an \r\nacquired psychiatric disorder, to include post-traumatic \r\nstress disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The veteran served in Vietnam from August 31, 1968 to \r\nMarch 3, 1969; he received no combat awards or decorations. \r\n\r\n2.  During service the veteran was found to have inadequate \r\npersonality (probably paranoid personality), and situational \r\nmaladjustment.  \r\n\r\n3.  The veteran has reported stressors in service; service \r\nrecords or other credible supporting evidence does not verify \r\nany of the claimed stressors; he did not engage in combat \r\nwith the enemy.\r\n\r\n4.  The veteran is not a reliable historian as to alleged \r\nstressful events in service; even if it were assumed that he \r\ndid �engage in combat with the enemy� his accounts of his \r\nexperiences are not satisfactory since they are contradicted \r\nby service records.\r\n\r\n5.  Post-service there have been a multiplicity of diagnoses \r\nfor the veteran, by various psychiatrists and psychologists, \r\nto include major depression, dysthymia, personality disorder, \r\norganic mood disorder, anxiety disorder, PTSD, and \r\nsubthreshold post-traumatic stress disorder.\r\n\r\n6.  There are no comprehensive and credible medical \r\nevaluations of the veteran that have diagnosed PTSD based \r\nupon actual, verified or credible experiences during active \r\nduty.\r\n\r\n7.  There is no competent medical evidence that the veteran \r\nhas an acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD, related \r\nto his active military service.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nAn acquired psychiatric disorder, to include post-traumatic \r\nstress disorder, was not incurred in or aggravated by active \r\nmilitary service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1154(b) 5107(a) (West \r\n1991); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303(a)(d), 3.304(d)(f) (1995).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served in the Republic of South Vietnam, and \r\nthere are diagnoses of PTSD in VA clinical records.  On the \r\nbasis of this evidence, the Board finds his claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD plausible, and thus well-grounded.  \r\nMurphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet.App. 78, 81 (1990).  The Board \r\nfurther finds that the RO has amply discharged the duty to \r\nassist under 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a).\r\n\r\nBasically, the applicable law and regulations provide that \r\nservice connection can be established if a particular disease \r\nor injury, resulting in disability, is incurred coincident \r\nwith service, if a disability is found to be proximately due \r\nto or the result of a service-connected disease or injury, or \r\nif a chronic disease, as specified in 38 U.S.C.A. � 1101, is \r\nmanifested to a compensable degree within one year thereaf-\r\nter.  Presumptive periods are not intended to limit service \r\nconnection to diseases so diagnosed when the evidence \r\nwarrants direct service connection.  Determinations as to \r\nservice connection will be based on review of the entire \r\nevidence of record, with due consideration of the policy of \r\nthe VA to administer the law under a broad and liberal \r\ninterpretation consistent with the facts in each individual \r\ncase.  38 C.F.R. �� 3.303(a)(b)(c)(d), 3.307, 3.309, 3.310.\r\n\r\nA determination of service connection for post-traumatic \r\nstress disorder requires medical evidence establishing a \r\nclear diagnosis thereof, credible supporting evidence that \r\nthe claimed service stressors actually occurred, and a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence, between current \r\nsymptomatology and the claimed service stressor.  If the \r\nclaimed stressor is related to combat, service department \r\nevidence that the veteran engaged in combat or that he was \r\nawarded the requisite combat citations will be accepted, in \r\nthe absence of evidence to the contrary, as conclusive \r\nevidence of the claimed in service stressors.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f) (1995).  In a case where PTSD is claimed as a \r\nresult of combat stressors, there must be a specific finding \r\nas to whether the veteran was engaged in combat and, if so, \r\nwhether the claimed stressor(s) is/are related to combat.  \r\nZarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 (1993).  If he was not \r\nengaged in combat, or if he was but the claimed stressor(s) \r\nare not related to combat, his lay testimony of in service \r\nstressors is insufficient, standing alone, to establish \r\nservice connection, it must be corroborated by credible \r\nsupporting evidence.  While service records are not the only \r\nmeans of corroborating the existence of the stressors, those \r\nservice records which are available must support, i.e. must \r\nnot contradict, his lay testimony concerning his non-combat \r\nrelated stressors.  Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet.App. 283 (1994).\r\n\r\nPsychiatric Disability, including PTSD\r\n\r\nThe veteran was in a construction battalion in Vietnam from \r\nAugust 1968 to March 1969.  A Deployment Completion Report \r\nfor his unit, for the above time period, lists significant \r\nevents during the deployment.  Two incidents of hostile \r\nactivity were noted.  One involved a member of the unit who \r\nsustained lacerations of the face and neck from a booby trap \r\non October 13, 1968.  The location of this incident was south \r\nof Da Nang and the injured serviceman was working with a \r\nmarine unit.  Service medical records show that two days \r\nbefore and two days after this incident, the veteran was seen \r\nby medical personnel.  He was noted to be working as a mess \r\ncook on the first occasion and that there had been �no \r\nproblems� during the intervening four days when he was seen \r\non the second occasion.  The Deployment Completion Report \r\nshows that in early December 1968, at quarry crusher site \r\noperated by the unit came under mortar and small arms fire, \r\nand 2 men were wounded.  This incident was highlighted.  No \r\nother incidents of hostile activity were noted.\r\n\r\nBackground.  The consensus of information gleaned from social \r\nwork, psychological and psychiatric examination reports in \r\nfile indicate that the veteran lived with his grandparents \r\nuntil the 7th grade when his mother remarried.  He reportedly \r\nhad problems with an abusive, alcoholic stepfather, ran away \r\nin high school, had a probation officer, lived at a facility \r\naway from his parents, and graduated from high school in \r\n1965.  After high school, and before service he went to \r\nmechanic training schools in North Dakota, and Nebraska.  On \r\nat least one occasion, in October 1984, the veteran denied \r\nany alcohol abuse in his family.\r\n\r\nService medical records show that in late September 1968 he \r\nwas referred for evaluation by his crew chief.  A flat effect \r\nwas noted.  In October 1968 it was noted that while on mess \r\nduty the veteran was again referred by his chief as unable to \r\nget along with others and �potential trouble.�  It was noted \r\nthat he reported being tense and having been threatened by \r\nothers he lived with; he also reported being unable to sleep.   \r\nHe was provided Librium.  His complaints of nervousness and \r\nsleep problems continued in October.  Family problems were \r\nnoted, as were �paranoid� thoughts about the veteran�s fellow \r\nworkers.  The impression was inadequate personality (probably \r\nparanoid personality).  He was provided Equanil and returned \r\nto duty.  Later in October the veteran was again referred by \r\nhis chief as he had been in 2 fights in 2 days, and was \r\nunable to get along with anyone.  The impression was true \r\nparanoid tendencies, exact type unknown, and a psychiatric \r\nevaluation was requested.  It was noted that as the report \r\nwas written the veteran continued to talk and seemed to be \r\ndisoriented.\r\n\r\nPsychiatric evaluation was performed in late October 1968 \r\naboard a hospital ship, and at that time the veteran \r\ncomplained of fighting, nervousness and insomnia.  A brief \r\nhistory was given; there was no reference to any exposure to \r\nany combat incident or exposure to others who had been killed \r\nor wounded.  On mental status exam his affect was flat but he \r\nexhibited no evidence of psychosis, or disabling neurosis.  \r\nHe wanted to operate a 5 ton truck, complete his training and \r\nservice, and was worried about his mother.  The impression \r\nwas situational maladjustment.  He was returned to duty at \r\nthe end of October 1968, and there were no further recorded \r\nrelevant complaints for the remainder of his time in service.  \r\nWhen examined for separation in October 1969, in his \r\ncontemporaneously prepared Report of Medical History, the \r\nveteran denied having or having now, depression or nervous \r\ntrouble of any sort.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran�s medical history briefly resumes in February and \r\nApril 1976, when seen by the VA.  In February he complained \r\nof being socially inept and problems around girls.  A brief \r\npersonal history was given.  The impression was mild depres-\r\nsion in a veteran of dull normal intelligence which seemed to \r\nimpair social interaction, creating problems on the job and \r\nwith girls.  He failed to show for a scheduled appointment at \r\nthe mental health clinic in March 1976 but showed up at the \r\ninternal medicine clinic April with complaints to include \r\nseeing stars when he is walking.  He thought he had an ulcer.  \r\nIt was noted that he worried a lot.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran�s VA medical history begins in earnest in 1983.  \r\nAt that time he complained of being jumpy, nervous, uptight \r\nand under pressure since Vietnam.  MMPI (Minnesota \r\nMultiphasic Personality Inventory) testing in March 1983 \r\nresulted in an impression of situational depression in a man \r\nwith prominent emotional and behavioral instability.  When \r\nseen at a mental health clinic in April 1983 he stated that \r\nhe had a lot of bitter memories about Vietnam but had no \r\nnightmares or flashbacks.  He suspected his temper was \r\nrelated to his Vietnam experience.  On psychological \r\nevaluation in April 1983, the impression was adjustment \r\nreaction with disturbance of emotions.  In December 1983 the \r\nimpression was adjustment reaction, alcohol abuse.  Reference \r\nwas made to stress related to unemployment.\r\n\r\nIn 1984 the veteran was seen for medical problems associated \r\nwith tattoo removal, and in October 1984 for depression.  \r\nMMPI results in October 1984 were interpreted as showing a \r\ndepressed and anxious individual, likely to be impulsive and \r\nhave troubled thought patterns.  The diagnosis for the \r\nveteran were dysthymic disorder, and passive-dependent \r\npersonality disorder.  In an October 1984 referral for \r\nVietnam group therapy, it was noted that the and seen some \r\n�blood and bodies� and felt that his life had been adversely \r\naffected by his experiences in Vietnam.  The provisional \r\ndiagnosis was dysthymic disorder.  It was noted that he was \r\nin the National Guard.  The veteran received private \r\ntreatment in October 1986 following a truck accident in which \r\nhe sustained a head injury.  He was hospitalized in November \r\nand December 1986, feeling dysphoric since discontinuing work \r\nas a truck driver.  He reported similar symptoms after losing \r\nhis job in 1984.  He denied nightmares or intrusive thoughts \r\nof service.  Again there was an MMPI profile in November \r\n1986, suggesting a personality disorder with depression and \r\nanxiety.  A November counseling report asked the veteran \r\nabout life threatening events in service, and on a scale of 0 \r\n(the lowest) to 10 (the highest), the veteran reported some-\r\ntimes a 2 and sometimes a 7, noting that he was fired upon, \r\nand had returned fire.  He did not know of any loss of life \r\nin his immediate unit.  The diagnosis was major depression \r\nwithout melancholia.  \r\n\r\nIn 1988 the veteran was concerned about his memory loss.  \r\nThere was a question of organic versus function impairment.  \r\nWhen hospitalized from October 1988 to February 1989 the \r\ndiagnosis was major depression.  In November 1988 it was \r\nnoted that there was no evidence of organic impairment, and \r\nMMPI showed marked depression and qualities of a personality \r\ndisorder or PTSD.  In a November 1988 treatment plan the \r\ndiagnosis was major depression.  A November 1988 CT \r\n(computerized tomography) scan of the veteran�s brain showed \r\nmild atrophy.  \r\n\r\nIn December 1988 the veteran reported doing �security� for \r\nwork crews at night, seeing dead bodies on hanging on wires, \r\nand during the Tet offensive in 1968, at Vinh Dai, being in a \r\n4 man bunker, with firing going on at night.  He stated he \r\nwas sent to a hospital ship because his nerves were �shot.�  \r\n\r\nThe veteran was hospitalized in June and July 1989 for \r\ndepression, despondency and discouragement, and the diagnosis \r\nwas organic personality disorder.  He also received treatment \r\nin a day care center in 1989.  In a closing summary from the \r\nday care treatment center, in November 1989, the diagnosis \r\nwas organic personality disorder.\r\n\r\nVA psychiatric examination was performed in August 1989 it \r\nwas noted that the veteran had great difficulty in adjust to \r\npeople and stated that while in Vietnam he was sent to a \r\nhospital ship because of his difficulties in getting along \r\nwith people.  The veteran stated that most of his friends had \r\neither died of natural causes or committed suicide and that \r\nthis had left him essentially alone.  The examiner opined \r\nthat his chronic and sever depression was an anaclitic \r\ndepression based on his apparent chronic deprivation \r\nthroughout childhood.  The diagnoses were major depression, \r\nhistory of alcohol abuse, and possible organic personality \r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nVA out-patient treatment record show the appellant was seen \r\nby a psychiatric social worker and a physician on May 23, \r\n1991.  The notes show detailed descriptions of the veteran \r\ncurrent occupational and social difficulties, recorded \r\ncomplaints of irritability, headaches, sadness weakness and \r\nanxious about his job and future.  There was no reference to \r\nany experience in service, nightmares, flashbacks or any \r\n�reexperiencing� phenomena.  Assessment included �PTSD - \r\ndepression.�  Further outpatient records in this series \r\nthrough 1991 show a similar pattern of complaints and \r\nconcerns, with at least one other notation of PTSD.  Later in \r\nthe year, diagnosis was noted to be organic mood disorder and \r\norganic personality disorder.  In the first months of 1992, \r\nthe same pattern continues.  Diagnosis at the end of March \r\n1992 was depression and personality disorder. \r\n\r\nA VA physician, G. Falk, M.D., in a February 1992 medical \r\nstatement for the a state job training department, reported \r\nthat the veteran had �depression, post traumatic stress \r\ndisorder-memory.�  There was no explanation for the basis for \r\nthese diagnoses.\r\n\r\n[redacted] and [redacted], former employers of the veteran, in a \r\nstatement dated in September 1992, noted that the veteran \r\nworked for them over three months in 1991-1992 and that he \r\nwould wake up in the middle of the night screaming.\r\n\r\n[redacted], in a statement dated in October 1992, \r\nidentified himself as a friend of the veteran�s since 1961, \r\ngoing to high school together until 1965, when the population \r\nof one high school was divided up between 3 high schools, and \r\nhe and the veteran were split up.  Mutual friends and \r\nactivities were reported.  Mr. [redacted] noted that in \r\nNovember 1967, before he shipped over to Vietnam, he slept at \r\nthe veteran�s apartment the veteran, and the veteran had no \r\nproblems sleeping.  Mr. [redacted] detailed events surrounding \r\nthe veteran�s employment in 1969, and exploitation of his \r\nsensitivity to loud noises.  In 1976 he observed the veteran \r\nwaking up in the night and screaming about �gooks.�  \r\n\r\nVA psychiatry service progress notes, in 1992 and 1993 show \r\ndiagnoses of personality disorder and depression in 1992, and \r\nin September 1993 it was noted that after evaluation in \r\nJanuary he was felt to have PTSD.  The diagnoses were \r\ndysthymia and PTSD.  \r\n\r\nFor purposes of clarity and simplicity, the Board will break \r\nthe chronological discussion of the evidence to note next a \r\nsocial work report in January 1993.  This document noted that \r\nMr. [redacted] made a strong case that the veteran�s behavior \r\ntotally changed since Vietnam.  Military history provided by \r\nthe veteran indicated he first heard bombs going off when he \r\ndeplaned in Vietnam.  He stated he was initially assigned to \r\na rock crusher and being there about a month, driving a dump \r\ntruck and getting lost and having a Vietnamese jump up on his \r\ntruck and say GI you die.  Also while driving a dump truck he \r\nsaw a small helicopter blow up, and after 3 months of combat \r\nhe was assigned to a perimeter guard tower but was too \r\nfreighted to stay up in the tower.  After 3 or 4 months in \r\ncountry he observed MP (military police) activity at an off \r\nlimits area, and 3 or 4 body bags were pulled out and he was \r\ntold �a couple� marines had been killed trying to �get laid.�  \r\nAfter 6 or 8 months in country, while operating a bulldozer, \r\nhe received incoming fire and took refuge under the dozer.  \r\nAfter that he was sent to a hospital ship to se a \r\npsychiatrist.  He reported that after 10 months in country he \r\nwent to a PX (post exchange) next to a landing strip for a \r\nhospital and he could �see WIA�s and KIA�s being unloaded, \r\nhear them screaming�.  After 6 or 8 months in country while \r\ndriving in a convoy he saw 7 or 8 VC (Viet Cong) bodies \r\nhanging on a fence.  He noted spending the rest of his tour \r\non a security bunker with 4 men manning an M60 and next to a \r\ntank.  It was reported that the veteran had constant dreams \r\nabout seeing the helicopter explode, seeing the body bags, \r\nand the boy jumping on his truck.  It was noted that the \r\nveteran could not remember events in sequence.  The report \r\nwas completed by R. Bourdaghs, clinical social worker.\r\n\r\nIn a statement dated in October 1992 the veteran recounted \r\nthe various incidents in Vietnam that he felt were traumatic, \r\nincluding a person jumping on his truck, a helicopter blowing \r\nup, being at the PX when wounded were flown in, operating a \r\nbulldozer when receiving incoming fire, 4 dead marines in an \r\noff limits area, watch tower duty, a tank next to the bunker, \r\nbeing dragged to safety during a mortar attack, dead VC, and \r\nwaking up to find a woman in his hut.  He indicated that he \r\ndid not know why he was sent to a hospital ship.\r\n\r\nIn hearing testimony in November 1992, [redacted] provided \r\ntestimony essentially the same as in his statement in \r\nOctober, Transcript, pages 2-7.  In recounting traumatic \r\nincidents, the veteran noted that the dozer incident was \r\nwhile making a disposal plant.  Transcript, pages 10, 11, 12, \r\n13, 16, 17, 18, 20 and 21.  \r\n\r\nDr. Falk, in a statement dated in March 1993 opined that he \r\nbelieved, based on observations of the veteran and \r\ninformation from Mr. Bourdaghs, that the veteran had a \r\nprimary diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder.  \r\n\r\nPer the June 1995 remand request, the veteran underwent VA \r\npsychiatric examination and testing, in October 1995.  In a \r\nhistory of psychosocial stressors completed by the veteran he \r\nreported first going to Vietnam in April 1968, seeing people \r\nkilled and wounded twice a week, and being wounded or injured \r\nin Vietnam.  \r\n\r\nPsychological testing and evaluation was performed in October \r\n1995.  A back ground and history was given.  It was noted \r\nthat the veteran described himself as a small lonely child \r\npicked on and beaten up a few time by peers, and he acknowl-\r\nedged significant problems with interpersonal distrust as an \r\nadolescent.  He received poor grades in school and was in \r\nspecial education classes for math and reading.  Traumatic \r\nevents recounted by the veteran included small arms and \r\nmortar fire approximately once a week, observing the bodies \r\nof dead VC �a couple� times, witnessing 2 dead marines that \r\nhad been stabbed in the back at a whorehouse, and witnessing \r\nat close range 2 men killed when a chopper they were in was \r\nhit by a mortar.  He stated he was afraid the whole time he \r\nwas in Vietnam.  It was noted that the events described were \r\nprobably sufficient to meet DSM-III-R criterion.  \r\n\r\nIt was recorded that the veteran�s response regarding \r\npossible PTSD symptoms were ambiguous and made rating quite \r\ndifficult.  Under criterion B (persistent reexperiencing of \r\nthe event), his reports were vague and he was unable to \r\nspecify any recurrent and intrusive distressing recollection \r\nof events describe above.  He reported a history of \r\nnightmares but was unable to provide details about specific \r\ncontent in his dreams.  It was noted that while he possibly \r\nmet the criteria for criteria A, B, and D on the SCID PTSD \r\nmodule, he provided insufficient evidence meeting criterion \r\nC.  A Mississippi Scale testing was performed in September \r\n1995, and suggest mild PTSD symptomatology.  Reference was \r\nmade to MMPI-2 testing twice during hospitalization in \r\nSeptember 1995, and that both profiles were invalid.  The \r\nresults of the MMPI tests in 1983, 1984 and 1988 were \r\nreviewed.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation impression was that the present evaluation \r\nsuggested the presence of PTSD symptomatology, but provided \r\ninsufficient evidence to establish a firm diagnosis.  Overall \r\nthe results did not clearly support a diagnosis of PTSD.  The \r\ndiagnostic impression was dysthymia, anxiety disorder NOS \r\n(subthreshold PTSD symptomatology) and personality disorder \r\nNOS.\r\n\r\nPsychiatric evaluation was also conducted in October 1995.  \r\nThe veteran reported being exposed to mortar and artillery \r\nattacks, perhaps once a week, and during the TET offensive in \r\n1968 he reported being exposed to rocket and mortar attacks \r\nand being very frightened.  He said some of his acquaintances \r\nwere killed but could give no details regarding that.  He \r\nalso reported seeing 4 or 5 dead north Vietnamese on barbed \r\nwire, seeing a helicopter blown up after leaving the ground , \r\nseeing some wounded in a hospital and some body bags \r\ncontaining 2 marines ostensible killed in a �house of ill \r\nfame.�  He reported being sent to a hospital ship when he \r\nbecame nervous.  In a review of personal history it was noted \r\nthat he had been in a correctional facility for delinquent \r\nteenagers for about 2 years.  \r\n\r\nOn mental status examination paranoid trends were evident and \r\nthe veteran appeared quite pessimistic and chronically mildly \r\nto moderately depressed.  Some psychomotor retardation �may \r\nbe present.�  Thought was constricted and judgment appeared \r\nto be impaired by paranoid ideation and orientation.  Insight \r\nappeared to be poor.  There was no significant memory \r\nimpairment noted; however he did have some difficulty \r\nremembering dates.\r\n\r\nThe examiner reviewed the veteran�s pre-military, military, \r\nand post-military history, as well as the psychological \r\ntesting.  It was noted that the exact psychiatric diagnosis \r\nwas difficult in view of the multiplicity of diagnoses made \r\npreviously, and the many diagnostic factors and features some \r\nof which seemed to cross over the different diagnostic lines.  \r\nThe examiner felt that while the veteran met criterion A he \r\nwas subthreshold for criterion B.  There was no intense \r\npsychological distress, no recurrent intrusive recollection \r\nof the traumatic events, and he was no longer having \r\nnightmares.  He did not act or feel as if the events were \r\nrecurring.  In regard to criterion C he did nave a sense of \r\nforeshortened future, but this was his usual depressive \r\npessimistic view of the world.  It was believed he was \r\nsubthreshold for criterion C, and as far as criterion D was \r\nconcerned he had no hyperviligence, sleep disturbance, and \r\nthe startle response did not appear to be severe.  It was \r\nopined that he veteran had some manifestations of post-\r\ntraumatic stress disorder, but the examiner believed they may \r\nhave been of subthreshold magnitude and perhaps half of his \r\npsychopathology and impaired social and vocational \r\nfunctioning had been based on personality disorder, anxiety \r\nand depression, and that this was only partially related to \r\nPTSD.  It was noted that Dr. Kang had mentioned the veteran \r\nhaving an obsessive concern about compensation issues.  \r\n\r\nAnalysis.  The Board must first note as a preliminary matter \r\nthat it is evident that the veteran now has arrived at the \r\nfirm and sincere personal conviction that he experiences a \r\npsychiatric disorder attributable to his service in Vietnam.  \r\nAlthough the Board must point out below some obvious \r\ndiscrepancies in the record, the Board by no means believes \r\nthat these discrepancies stem from any deliberate fabrication \r\nas opposed to simply inaccurate memory.  Further, the record \r\nis clear that the veteran performed his assigned duties in \r\nVietnam and that his life has not been easy either before or \r\nafter service.  None of these factors, alone or collectively, \r\nhowever, provides a basis for favorable action.  \r\n\r\nThe starting point for any determination with regard to PTSD \r\nis one or more �stressors.�  The existence of a stressor, \r\nthough not its quality, is an adjudicative, not a medical \r\ndetermination.  Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet.App. 91 (1993).  The \r\nBoard finds nothing in the documentary evidence of record \r\nfrom the service department, either in the form of \r\nadministrative or medical records, to show that the veteran \r\n�engaged in combat with the enemy.�  His awards and \r\ndecorations are not combat related, and his duties and \r\nassignments were with a support unit.  With respect to the \r\naward of the Fleet Marine Force Combat Operation Insignia, \r\nthe Board must point out that the authorizing letter \r\nspecifically states the basis of the award was �service \r\nperformed in the combat zone,� not �combat service,� \r\n�participation in combat� �participation in combat with the \r\nenemy� or some other description that would begin to support \r\na finding that he engaged in combat with the enemy.  \r\nMoreover, and of considerable weight in this case, the unit \r\ndeployment report does not support a finding of �combat with \r\nthe enemy.�  In view of this record, the Board finds the \r\nappellant did not engage in combat with the enemy and thus is \r\nnot entitled to any presumption of validity of his accounts \r\nof alleged �stressors.�\r\n\r\nFurther, with respect to what the unit deployment report \r\ndocuments, the veteran�s more recent accounts of being \r\nexposed very frequently, that is on the order of once a week \r\nor even more, to incoming fire from the enemy is flatly \r\ncontradicted.  The report details only two episodes where \r\nmembers of the unit were under fire or wounded.  It is \r\nimpossible to believe from the contents of this report that \r\nit would have been wholly silent about such very frequent \r\nenemy action, not to mention the difficulty in believing that \r\nsuch frequent enemy fire could have produced no other wounds \r\nor injuries.   With respect to the quality of his accounts, \r\nthe Board notes that the great bulk of them have been very \r\nvague and general.  Although he alleged that acquaintances \r\nwere killed, he has identified none and his unit report makes \r\nit clear that there were no combat related fatalities in his \r\nconstruction battalion.  While the veteran reports memory \r\nproblems, no significant memory problem was noted on \r\nexamination in October 1995.  In fact the Board notes an \r\nincrease in the veteran�s recollection of events in Vietnam \r\nover the years.  In 1988 he had about 3 events to relate but \r\ncurrently he has about tripled his stories.  \r\n\r\nHis tales of stressful events often contain some \r\ndiscrepancies in the telling and retelling.  The event where \r\nhe was exposed to small arms fire while on a bulldozer does \r\nnot correlate with any significant event in the unit \r\ndeployment report.  In the unit report 2 men were injured in \r\nearly December 1968 while at a quarry at a rock crusher site.  \r\nThe veteran reports his event occurring at a disposal site, 6 \r\nto 8 months after arriving in Vietnam, and he makes no \r\nreference to anyone being wounded.  The Board also notes that \r\nthe veteran in 1988 and 1995, placed himself in Vietnam \r\nduring the Tet offensive in 1968.  His service record show he \r\narrived in Vietnam in August 1968, after the Tet offensive \r\nvery early in the year.  The episode with marines killed \r\nwhile at a �house of ill repute� has varied in the telling \r\nover the years, originally starting with 3 to 4 body bags and \r\na �couple� marines, then 4 bodies, and currently only 2 \r\nbodies, that had been stabbed.  The incident of seeing \r\nwounded marines was said to occur 10 months after being in \r\ncountry.  Although his accounts have implied a link between \r\ncombat related stress and his referral to the hospital ship, \r\nthe actual records of that referral make no such connection.  \r\nFurther, in referring to flashbacks and intrusive thoughts, \r\nduring the October 1995 psychological evaluation, he was \r\nunable to provide details about specific content in his \r\ndreams.  In light of all of the above, the Board does not \r\nfind his accounts of alleged stressors are credible.  The \r\nBoard must point out in this context that adjudicators are \r\nnot bound to accept the findings of health professionals \r\nconcerning accounts of alleged �stressors.�  Wood v. Der-\r\nwinski, 1 Vet.App. 190 (1991).\r\n\r\nThere is a further and fundamental reason why the veteran�s \r\nclaim for service connection for PTSD must be denied.  A \r\ndetermination of service connection requires a finding of the \r\nexistence of a current disability and a determination of a \r\nrelationship between that disability and an injury or disease \r\nincurred in service.   Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet.App. 309, 314 \r\n(1993).  In this case the Board concludes that the diagnoses \r\nof PTSD by Dr. Falk are not entitled to probative weight.  \r\nFirst of all, these diagnoses are by no means supported by a \r\ndetailed comparison of the diagnostic criteria for PTSD with \r\nthe facts in this case.  Further, insofar as Dr. Falk relied \r\nupon the accounts of alleged stressors that the Board does \r\nnot find credible, the Board finds that the diagnosis is not \r\nsupportable.  Black v. Brown, 5 Vet.App. 177 (1993).  \r\nFurther, the October 1995 psychiatric examination and \r\nevaluation, which were extremely detailed and comprehensive, \r\nhave not found manifestations of PTSD that support a \r\ndiagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder for the veteran.  \r\nThe psychiatric examiner felt that most of the criteria for a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD were subthreshold.  The Board finds this \r\nmedical opinion as to the existence of a current PTSD is \r\nentitled to the greatest weight.  Since this opinion is that \r\nthe veteran does not have PTSD, the requirements of Watson \r\nare not met.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that the \r\noverwhelming weight of the evidence is against the claim for \r\nPTSD and the doctrine of reasonable doubt is not for \r\napplication. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1154, 5107; 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.303, 3.304.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the post-service diagnosis of an acquired \r\npsychiatric disorder, variously diagnosed, it is for \r\nconsideration that there is no competent medical evidence \r\nassociating any such disorder with any event of his active \r\nmilitary service, including the evaluation on the hospital \r\nship in October 1968.  It has been indicated, at least once, \r\nthat the veteran�s depression is associated with his \r\nchildhood development.  \r\n\r\nIn regard to the statements by [redacted] concerning the \r\nveteran�s conduct before and after Vietnam, the Board notes \r\nthat Mr. [redacted], in discussing the veteran�s high school \r\nyears, makes no reference to the veteran�s family problems, \r\nhis separation from his family, or the veteran�s residence \r\nduring his last year or two of high school.  He also made no \r\nreference to the veteran�s academic problems in school.  It \r\non this basis, the Board does not find Mr. [redacted]�s \r\nrecollections to be credible, not in the sense of whether he \r\nreports honestly what he now recollects, but in the sense of \r\nwhether his recollections are accurate.  Given the dramatic \r\ndifference between Mr. [redacted]�s recollections of events \r\nprior to service and the actual record, the Board finds that \r\nMr. [redacted]�s recollections of post service events likewise \r\nare highly suspect.  Further, the vivid description of \r\nnightmares is contradicted by the absence of such complaints \r\nwhen the appellant was initially seen, and by the current \r\nfindings which emphasize the lack of indication that the \r\nappellant reexperiences events in service.  Ultimately, of \r\ncourse, such lay evidence from Mr. [redacted] or the Fallens \r\ncould not establish medical diagnosis or causation, and thus \r\ncan not serve as competent evidence of the presence of PTSD \r\nor any psychiatric disorder related to service.  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, \r\nincluding PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tRICHARD B.

He \r\nmaintains therefore that service connection is warranted.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECISION OF THE BOARD\r\n\r\nThe Board, in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 7104 (West 1991 & Supp. 1995), has reviewed and considered \r\nall of the evidence and material of record in the veteran's \r\nclaims file.  Based on its review of the relevant evidence in \r\nthis matter, and for the following reasons and bases, it is \r\nthe decision of the Board that the preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against the claim for service connection for \r\nPTSD.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  All relevant evidence necessary for an equitable \r\ndisposition of the veteran�s claim has been developed.\r\n\r\n2.  The evidence of record does not show a clear diagnosis of \r\nPTSD, nor does it show a link, established by medical \r\nevidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed \r\ninservice stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (f) (1995).\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by active service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 1991 & Supp. 1995);  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f) (1995).\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThe veteran�s service medical records are silent for any \r\ncomplaints, treatment, or diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn March 1988, the veteran was admitted to the Carl Albert \r\nCommunity Mental Health Center.  A psychosocial evaluation \r\ndated in May 1988 indicated that the veteran was unemployed \r\nand living with his mother.  It was reported that the veteran \r\nwas arrested for shooting his wife following a domestic \r\nargument.  The veteran stated that he had a problem with \r\nalcohol abuse which he felt was related to a chronic problem \r\nof depression.  He denied any suicidal or homicidal thoughts.  \r\nThe Axis I diagnosis was life circumstances problem.  Upon \r\ndischarge in October 1988, the veteran was diagnosed with \r\nalcohol dependence.\r\n\r\nA medical record dated in April 1991, showed that the veteran \r\nwas admitted to the substance abuse treatment unit on March \r\n30, 1991 for treatment for alcohol dependence and depression.  \r\nUpon discharge it was reported that he was sober, his \r\nemotional reactions were adequately controlled, and he did \r\nnot display any symptoms of psychotic disturbance, and his \r\nbehavior was appropriate.  He denied any suicidal or \r\nhomicidal ruminations.  The veteran did not show any \r\ndeterioration of intellectual or emotional functioning.  The \r\ndischarge diagnoses were alcohol dependence, continuous \r\ndysthymic disorder.\r\n\r\nIn May 1991 the veteran was again admitted to the Carl Albert \r\nCommunity Mental Health Center.  It was indicated that his \r\nproblems included anxiety and being released from prison and \r\nhe requested assistance dealing with this.  The discharge \r\ndiagnosis provided by Richard Brown, MSW, was PTSD and \r\nsubstance abuse.\r\n\r\nVA outpatient treatment records dated from May 1991 to July \r\n1992, showed that the veteran received treatment regarding \r\nalcohol abuse, in addition to counseling regarding PTSD.  The \r\nveteran reported having nightmares, anger and depression.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran was hospitalized on a voluntary basis from May \r\n14, to June 17, 1992 at the VA Medical Center, Waco, Texas, \r\n(VAMC).  On admission, he had complaints of insomnia, \r\nnightmares, depression, suicidal thoughts off and on, anger, \r\nand intrusive thoughts about Vietnam.  He reported that he \r\nhad been having these symptoms off and on for the past ten \r\nyears.  Upon discharge, it was reported that he had improved \r\nand had better coping skills but had some PTSD symptoms.  He \r\nwas free of psychotic symptoms and was not considered \r\ndangerous to himself or others.  The Axis I diagnosis was \r\nPTSD.\r\n\r\nThe veteran underwent a VA PTSD examination in August 1992.  \r\nIt was reported that he was coherent and goal directed with \r\nno overt thinking disorder.  He had a depressed mood and a \r\nflattened affect.  No memory insufficiencies were noted and \r\ninsight was adequate.  The diagnosis was adjustment disorder, \r\ndepressed mood.  The examiner commented:  �Based upon the \r\nevidence in C-file and from this exam I cannot substantiate a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD.  No clear cut stressors identified and no \r\nsignificant intrusive thoughts apparent to me.�\r\n\r\nIn a statement dated in March 1993 from James W. Howarth, \r\nCounselor, it was indicated that the veteran was seen about \r\nten years prior for treatment of symptoms diagnosed as PTSD.  \r\nIt was reported that the veteran continued to have problems \r\nand difficulties associated with his Vietnam experience.  He \r\nhad problems with sleeping, bad dreams, and nightmares of \r\ntraumas experiences in Vietnam.  It was stated that the \r\nveteran was easily startled, moody, irritable and tends to \r\nwithdraw from others.  The diagnostic impression was PTSD.\r\n\r\nVA medical record dated in June 1993 showed that the veteran \r\nwas hospitalized from May 24, to June 18, 1993 with the chief \r\ncomplaint of alcoholism.  The discharge diagnoses were \r\nalcohol dependence and PTSD.\r\n\r\nDuring a VA PTSD examination performed in October 1993, it \r\nwas reported that while in Vietnam, the veteran drove an \r\nammunition truck and was in three rocket attacks and some \r\nmortar attacks.  He stated that he saw people killed and \r\nwounded.  On examination there was no psychosis, delusions, \r\nor hallucinations noted.  He was goal oriented and judgment \r\nwas fair.  The impression was alcohol dependence, chronic, \r\nmoderate; dysthymia, mild, chronic.  The examiner commented: \r\n\r\n� I don�t see enough stressors nor do I \r\nget the feel of a patient who has been \r\ntroubled with PTSD symptoms after his \r\nreturn to the states.  Granted he had \r\nsome fights and then had some nightmares \r\nfor a brief period of time.  I realize \r\nthat a lot of people have gone to the \r\ntrouble of documenting that he has PTSD \r\nbut I just don�t see it.�\r\n\r\n\r\nThe veteran underwent a VA examination in July 1994.  The \r\nexamination was performed by the same VA physician who \r\nconducted the October 1993 examination.  The examiner \r\ncommented � I still do not see enough in this case to change \r\nmy opinion about the PTSD.  I don�t see it in this man.�\r\n\r\nIn a report dated in July 1995, the U.S. Army and Joint \r\nServices Environmental Support Group confirmed that the \r\nveteran�s unit in Vietnam received mortar and rocket attacks.\r\n\r\nThe veteran underwent another VA PTSD examination in December \r\n1995.  He reported that he has trouble getting and staying \r\nasleep.  He said he handles stress by hollering, yelling or \r\ntrying to avoid it.  He reported being depressed and that he \r\ncries easily.  He reported occasional thoughts of suicide.  \r\nOn examination, he was cooperative, goal oriented, and \r\noriented to time, place, and person.  He was able to organize \r\nhis thoughts and express himself.  His affect was moderate, \r\nwith mild to moderate depression.  There was no psychosis, \r\ndelusions, or hallucinations.  The impression was dysthymia, \r\nchronic alcohol dependence.  His incapacity to work and \r\nsocialize was reported to be mild.  There was no diagnosis of \r\nPTSD rendered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107 (West 1991 & Supp. \r\n1995), and Murphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. (1990), the \r\nappellant has presented a meritorious or well-grounded claim.  \r\nThe facts relevant to this appeal have been properly \r\ndeveloped and the obligation of the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) to assist the veteran in the development of his \r\nclaim has been satisfied.  Id.\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted, in part, for �disability \r\nresulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted \r\nin the line of duty....�38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 (West 1991 & Supp. \r\n1995).  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1995) govern \r\nthe granting of service connection for post-traumatic stress \r\ndisorder.  This regulation provides that service connection \r\nmay be granted where there is a �clear diagnosis of the \r\ncondition, credible supporting evidence that the claimed \r\ninservice stressor actually occurred, and a link, established \r\nby medical evidence, between current symptomatology and the \r\nclaimed inservice stressor.�  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1995).\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the veteran has been diagnosed as having \r\nPTSD on several occasions, however, the evidence of record \r\nfails to provide a clear diagnosis of the condition.  \r\nSpecifically, the most recent VA examination of the veteran \r\ndated in December 1995, noted that there were no psychosis, \r\ndelusions, or hallucinations, and failed to render a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD.  Instead, the diagnoses were dysthymia, \r\nand chronic alcohol dependence.  Similarly, during the VA \r\nexamination dated in October 1993, the examiner stated in \r\npart: �I don�t see enough stressors nor do I get the feel of \r\na patient who has been trouble with PTSD symptoms after his \r\nreturn to the states... I just don�t see it.�  These findings \r\nwere confirmed on the July 1994 VA examination.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the evidence of record does not adequately provide \r\na link, established by medical evidence, between current \r\nsymptomatology and the claimed inservice stressor, as \r\nrequired under 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  As claimed stressors, \r\nthe veteran reports that while in Vietnam he was under three \r\nrocket attacks and one mortar attack.  He also indicated that \r\nhe lived in constant fear of being hit.  However, none of the \r\ndiagnoses of PTSD cited by the veteran specifically relates \r\nPTSD to the identified stressors.  A diagnosis of PTSD alone \r\nis not enough to grant service connection, it must be linked \r\nto an inservice stressor.  No such connection has been shown.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the absence of a clear diagnosis of PTSD, and \r\nthe lack evidence of a link between current symptomatology \r\nand the claimed inservice stressors, the preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against the veteran�s claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tJACK W.

Johnson, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from September 1968 to \r\nAugust 1970.\r\n\r\nThis matter initially came to the Board of Veterans� Appeals \r\n(Board) from a November 1994 decision of the Department of \r\nVeterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Winston-Salem, \r\nNorth Carolina, which denied service connection for a nervous \r\ncondition, to include PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn adjudicating a claim for service connection for PTSD, the \r\nBoard is required to evaluate the supporting evidence in \r\nlight of the places, types, and circumstances of service, as \r\nevidenced by the veteran's military records, and all \r\npertinent medical and lay evidence.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) \r\n(West 1991); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1995); See Hayes v. Brown, \r\n5 Vet.App. 60, 66 (1993).  Additionally, service connection \r\nfor PTSD requires medical evidence establishing a clear \r\ndiagnosis of the condition, credible supporting evidence that \r\nthe claimed inservice stressor actually occurred, and a link, \r\nestablished by the medical evidence, between current \r\nsymptomatology and the claimed inservice stressor.  See \r\nZarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet.App. 91, 97 (1993).\r\n\r\nService personnel records indicate that the veteran served in \r\nVietnam from August 1969 to July 1970, and received the usual \r\nmedals associated with service in Vietnam.  The Board notes \r\nthat the veteran has contended that he received the Purple \r\nHeart.  See VA Form 9, dated and received in May 1995.  \r\nService records also show that in August 1969, the veteran \r\nwas assigned to Company B, 69/44th SigBn, and HHC (SigSpt) \r\n69th SigBn.  In March 1970, he was assigned to Radio & Cable \r\nCompany, SigSptAgcy, Saigon.\r\n\r\nA VA rating examination was conducted in November 1994.  At \r\nthat time, testing was performed and diagnoses of PTSD and \r\nmajor depression were given.  However, it is noted in the \r\ntesting report that the veteran had difficulty being specific \r\nabout his combat experiences.  However, the test findings \r\nwere consistent with PTSD symptoms.  In the test report \r\nsummary, the examiner noted that there was some question \r\nregarding the validity of the magnitude of his combat \r\nexperience, and attributed it to conceptual difficulties and \r\npossible mild thought disturbance rather than an attempt to \r\nexaggerate symptoms.  The Board notes that it does not appear \r\nthat the claims folder was reviewed prior to the examination.  \r\n\r\nIn September 1996, the veteran was afforded a personal \r\nhearing.  At that hearing, the veteran and his spouse gave \r\ntestimony regarding his years of treatment for psychiatric \r\nproblems, as well as his combat-related stressors.  The \r\nveteran testified that in December 1969, his unit was pinned \r\ndown for about seven hours, and he witnessed casualties as \r\nwell as sustaining a shrapnel wound.  See September 1996 \r\nhearing transcript at page 4.  The veteran provided the names \r\nof his fellow soldiers that were hurt or killed during that \r\nattack.  See September 1996 hearing transcript at pages 12-\r\n16.  He testified that there were other incidents when his \r\nunit was under attack while in Long Bihn, Da Nang and Phu \r\nBai.  See September 1996 hearing transcript at pages 17-19.  \r\n\r\nIn West v. Brown, 7 Vet.App. 70 (1994), the Court elaborated \r\non the analysis in Zarycki.  In Zarycki, the Court held that \r\nin addition to demonstrating the existence of a stressor, the \r\nfacts must also establish that the alleged stressful event \r\nwas sufficient to give rise to PTSD.  Id. at 98-99.  In West, \r\nthe Court held that the sufficiency of the stressor is a \r\nmedical determination, and therefore adjudicators may not \r\nrender a determination on this point in the absence of \r\nindependent medical evidence.  Id. at 79.  The Court also \r\nheld in West that a psychiatric examination for the purpose \r\nof establishing the existence of PTSD was inadequate for \r\nrating purposes because the examiners relied, in part, on \r\nevents whose existence the Board had rejected.  Id. at 78.\r\n\r\nUpon reviewing Zarycki and West, it appears that in \r\napproaching a claim for service connection for PTSD, the \r\nquestion of the existence of an event claimed as a \r\nrecognizable stressor must be resolved by adjudicatory \r\npersonnel.  If the adjudicators conclude that the record \r\nestablishes the existence of such a stressor or stressors, \r\nthen and only then, the case should be referred for a medical \r\nexamination to determine the sufficiency of the stressor and \r\nwhether the remaining elements required to support the \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD have been met.  In such a referral, the \r\nadjudicators should specify to the examiner(s) precisely what \r\nstressors have been accepted as established by the record, \r\nand the medical examiners must be instructed that only those \r\nevents may be considered in determining whether stressors to \r\nwhich the veteran was exposed during service were of \r\nsufficient severity as to have resulted in current \r\npsychiatric symptoms.  In other words, if the adjudicators \r\ndetermine that the existence of an alleged stressor or \r\nstressors in service is not established by the record, a \r\nmedical examination to determine whether PTSD due to service \r\nis present is pointless.  Likewise, if the examiners render a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD that is not clearly based upon stressors in \r\nservice whose existence the adjudicators have accepted, the \r\nexamination would be inadequate for rating purposes.\r\n\r\nIt is the Board's judgment that there is the need for \r\nadditional development which might confirm the existence of \r\nthe veteran's combat experience, if any, or corroborate the \r\nveteran's description of stressor events during that service.  \r\nSee West v. Brown, 7 Vet.App. 70 (1994). \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that there is the need to secure additional \r\nmedical records.  In his notice of disagreement, dated \r\nJanuary 1995, the veteran provided a list of places and dates \r\nwhere he received psychiatric treatment since the 1970�s.  \r\nHowever, those records are not associated with the claims \r\nfolder.  The only medical evidence of record are the \r\nveteran�s VA treatment reports from March 1971 and a VA \r\nhospitalization report from March 1990.  The medical evidence \r\nalso includes an assessment report used by an administrative \r\nlaw judge, to grant Social Security Administration (SSA) \r\ndisability benefits in 1994.  However, the records used to \r\nmake that determination are not associated with the file. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should obtain the medical \r\nrecords the veteran listed on his January \r\n1995 notice of disagreement.  The RO \r\nshould also obtain from the SSA the \r\nrecords pertinent to the veteran�s claim \r\nfor Social Security disability benefits \r\nor SSI as well as the medical records \r\nrelied upon concerning that claim.  \r\nPrivate medical records should be secured \r\nupon the proper release.  All records \r\nobtained should then be associated with \r\nthe claims folder. \r\n\r\n2. The RO should provide information \r\nregarding the veteran�s claimed \r\nstressors, including the wounding of \r\nJerry Walton, Ronnie Church, and Jerry \r\nArchibald, and other combat experiences, \r\nas described in the hearing of September \r\n1996, along with a copy of the veteran's \r\nDD Form 214, and any other relevant \r\ndocumentation, to the United States Army \r\nand Joint Services Environmental Support \r\nGroup (ESG), 7798 Cissna Road, \r\nSpringfield, Virginia 22150, for the \r\npurpose of verifying any of the stressors \r\nreported by the veteran.\r\n\r\n3.  Following the above, the RO must make \r\nspecific determinations as to whether the \r\nveteran engaged in combat and as to the \r\noccurrence of the claimed stressors.  In \r\nrendering this determination, the \r\nattention of the RO is directed to the \r\ncases of Zarycki and West and the \r\ndiscussion above.  In any event, the RO \r\nmust specifically render a finding as to \r\nwhether the appellant \"engaged in combat \r\nwith the enemy.\"  If the RO determines \r\nthat the record establishes the existence \r\nof a stressor or stressors, the RO must \r\nspecify what stressor or stressors in \r\nservice it has determined are established \r\nby the record. In reaching this \r\ndetermination, the RO should address any \r\ncredibility questions raised by the \r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n4.  If, and only if, the RO determines \r\nthat the record establishes the existence \r\nof a stressor or stressors, then the RO \r\nshould arrange for the veteran to be \r\naccorded an examination by a board of two \r\nVA psychiatrists, if available, who have \r\nnot previously examined him to determine \r\nthe diagnoses of all psychiatric \r\ndisorders that are present.  The RO must \r\nspecify for the examiners the stressor or \r\nstressors that it has determined are \r\nestablished by the record and the \r\nexaminers must be instructed that only \r\nthose events may be considered for the \r\npurpose of determining whether exposure \r\nto a stressor in service has resulted in \r\ncurrent psychiatric symptoms and in \r\ndetermining whether the nature of the \r\nalleged event is of the quality required \r\nto produce PTSD.  The examination report \r\nshould reflect review of pertinent \r\nmaterial in the claims folder.  The \r\nexaminers should integrate the previous \r\npsychiatric findings and diagnoses with \r\ncurrent findings to obtain an accurate \r\npicture of the nature of the veteran's \r\npsychiatric status.  If the diagnosis of \r\nPTSD is deemed appropriate, the examiners \r\nshould comment upon which event was of \r\nthe quality required to support the \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD and as to whether there \r\nis a link between the current \r\nsymptomatology and one or more of the \r\ninservice stressors found to be \r\nestablished by the RO.  The report of \r\nexamination should include the complete \r\nrationale for all opinions expressed.  \r\nAll necessary special studies or tests \r\nshould be accomplished.  The claims \r\nfolder must be made available to the \r\nexaminers prior to the examination.\r\n\r\n5.  The RO should then review the record \r\nand ensure that all the above actions \r\nhave been completed.  When the RO is \r\nsatisfied that the record is complete and \r\nthe psychiatric examination is adequate \r\nfor rating purposes, the claim should be \r\nreadjudicated.  If the benefit sought is \r\ndenied, a supplemental statement of the \r\ncase should be issued which includes a \r\nsummary of additional evidence submitted, \r\nany additional applicable laws and \r\nregulations, and the reasons for the \r\ndecision.  The veteran and his \r\nrepresentative should be afforded the \r\napplicable time to respond.\r\n\r\nThereafter, subject to current appellate procedures, the \r\ncase should be returned to the Board for further appellate \r\nconsideration, if appropriate.  The veteran need take no \r\naction until he is further informed.  The purpose of this \r\nREMAND is to obtain additional information and to afford the \r\nveteran due process of law. The Board intimates no opinion, \r\neither factual or legal, as to the ultimate conclusion \r\nwarranted in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tG. H.

Howes, Attorney\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nNancy S. Kettelle, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active duty from November 1967 to November \r\n1969, July 1970 to July 1973, February 1976 to January 1978 \r\nand from April 1978 to June 1980.  \r\n\r\nThis matter came to the Board of Veterans� Appeals (Board) on \r\nappeal from rating decisions of the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Louisville, Kentucky.  \r\nIn January 1994, the Board remanded the case to the RO for \r\nconsideration of evidence received at the Board.  After \r\ncontinuing its prior determination that new and material \r\nevidence had not been added to the record to reopen the claim \r\nof entitlement to service connection for psychiatric \r\ndisability, including PTSD, the RO returned the case to the \r\nBoard.  In a February 1995 decision, the Board determined \r\nthat new and material evidence had been submitted sufficient \r\nto reopen the claim for entitlement to service connection for \r\npsychiatric disability, including PTSD.  The Board remanded \r\nthe case to the RO for additional development, including \r\nobtaining information from the United States Army and Joint \r\nService Environmental Support Group and providing the veteran \r\nwith a VA psychiatric examination.  The Board specified that \r\nthe RO was to review all evidence on a de novo basis and \r\nadjudicate the issue of entitlement to service connection for \r\npsychiatric disability, including PTSD.  The requested \r\ndevelopment was completed, and the RO denied the veteran�s \r\nclaim on the merits.  The RO issued a Supplemental Statement \r\nof the Case (SSOC) in October 1996.  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the record includes an April 1987 Social \r\nSecurity Administration (SSA) decision in which it was found \r\nthat medical evidence established that the veteran had severe \r\nalcoholism with intermittent problems with alcoholic \r\nhallucinosis, mixed personality disorder mostly involving \r\nparanoia and anti-social features, mild mental retardation \r\nand atypical anxiety disorder in recent years.  It was also \r\nfound that the severity of the veteran�s mental impairments \r\nhad precluded him from working for at least 12 consecutive \r\nmonths.  With his response to the October 1996 SSOC, the \r\nveteran submitted a copy of a February 1996 SSA letter \r\nregarding continuation of disability benefits and the \r\ndetermination that the veteran had health problems other than \r\nalcoholism that kept him from working.  The veteran has not \r\nsubmitted records relied upon by the SSA in making its recent \r\ndecision, and it is the Board�s opinion that in light of \r\nWaddell v. Brown, 5 Vet.App. 454, 457 (1993), an effort \r\nshould be made to obtain these records.  Although the issue \r\nhere is service connection, the SSA records may include \r\ninformation pertinent to the claim, and they should be \r\nobtained if possible.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED to the RO for the following \r\nactions:  \r\n\r\n1.  The RO should contact the veteran, \r\nthrough his attorney, and request that \r\nthe veteran identify the names, addresses \r\nand approximate dates of treatment for \r\nall health care providers, both VA and \r\nnon-VA, from which he has received \r\ntreatment or evaluation for any claimed \r\npsychiatric disability, including PTSD, \r\nsince November 1995.  With any necessary \r\nauthorization from the veteran, the RO \r\nshould attempt to obtain and associate \r\nwith the claims files any medical records \r\nidentified by the veteran which have not \r\nbeen secured previously.  \r\n\r\n2.  The RO should obtain from the SSA a \r\ncopy of the decision continuing benefits \r\nfor the veteran to which reference was \r\nmade in its February 1996 letter to the \r\nveteran and should, in addition, obtain a \r\ncopy of the entire record upon which the \r\ndecision was based.  \r\n\r\n3.  Thereafter, the RO should review the \r\nclaims files and ensure that all \r\ndevelopment actions, including obtaining \r\nthe cited SSA records, have been \r\ncompleted in full.  The RO should \r\nundertake any other indicated \r\ndevelopment, including additional \r\npsychiatric examination, if deemed \r\nappropriate.  Then, the RO should \r\nreadjudicate entitlement to service \r\nconnection for psychiatric disability, \r\nincluding PTSD.  \r\n\r\nIf the benefit sought on appeal is not granted to the \r\nveteran�s satisfaction, the RO should issue an SSOC, and the \r\nveteran and his attorney should be provided an opportunity to \r\nrespond.  Thereafter, the case should be returned to the \r\nBoard for further appellate consideration, if otherwise in \r\norder.  The Board intimates no opinion as to the ultimate \r\noutcome of this case.  The veteran need take no action until \r\nhe is otherwise notified by the RO through his attorney.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tSHANE A.

He further \r\nrequests that there should be additional investigation with \r\nrespect to the disappearance of his close friend during \r\ncombat action his unit was involved in while in Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECISION OF THE BOARD\r\n\r\nThe Board of Veterans� Appeals (Board), in accordance with \r\nthe provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. � 7104 (West 1991 & Supp. \r\n1997), has reviewed and considered all of the evidence and \r\nmaterial of record in the veteran's claims file.  Based on \r\nits review of the relevant evidence in this matter, and for \r\nthe following reasons and bases, it is the decision of the \r\nBoard that the veteran has not submitted evidence of a well \r\ngrounded claim.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  PTSD was not present in service or manifest within one \r\nyear thereafter, and there is no evidence of PTSD causally \r\nlinked to service.\r\n\r\n2.  There is no clear diagnosis of PTSD of record.\r\n\r\n3.  The veteran had verified active service from March 1970 \r\nto November 1971; he received no awards or decorations \r\ndenoting that he �engaged in combat with the enemy.�\r\n\r\n4.  The veteran has reported alleged stressors in service; \r\nservice records or other credible supporting evidence does \r\nnot verify any of the claimed stressors; he did not �engage \r\nin combat with the enemy.�\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe claim for service connection for PTSD is not well \r\ngrounded.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a) (West 1991).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  Background\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for a disability \r\nresulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by \r\nactive service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131 (West 1991 & Supp. \r\n1997).  For the showing of chronic disease in service there \r\nis required a combination of manifestations sufficient to \r\nidentify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to \r\nestablish chronicity at the time.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b) \r\n(1996).  If chronicity in service is not established, a \r\nshowing of continuity of symptoms after discharge is required \r\nto support the claim.  Id.  Service connection may be granted \r\nfor any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the \r\nevidence establishes that the disease was incurred in \r\nservice.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of section 1110 of this title, and subject \r\nto the provisions of section 1113 of this title, in the case \r\nof any veteran who served for ninety days or more during a \r\nperiod of war and a chronic disease, including a psychosis, \r\nbecomes manifest to a degree of ten percent or more within \r\none year from the date of separation from such service, such \r\ndisease shall be presumed to have been incurred in or \r\naggravated by such service notwithstanding there is no record \r\nof evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. � 1112 (West 1991).  Where there is affirmative \r\nevidence to the contrary, or evidence to establish that an \r\nintercurrent injury or disease which is a recognized cause of \r\nany of the diseases within the purview of section 1112 of \r\nthis title, has been suffered between the date of separation \r\nfrom service and the date of onset of any such diseases, or \r\nthe disability is due to the veteran�s own willful \r\nmisconduct, service connection pursuant to section 1112 will \r\nnot be in order.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1113 (West 1991).  The \r\nprovisions of section 1112 are applicable in the case of any \r\nveteran who served in the active military, naval, or air \r\nservice after December 31, 1946.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1137 (West \r\n1991).\r\n\r\nCongenital or developmental defects such as personality \r\ndisorders are not diseases or injuries within the meaning of \r\nthe applicable legislation.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(c).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\nestablishing a clear diagnosis of the condition, credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed inservice stressor \r\nactually occurred, and a link, established by medical \r\nevidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed \r\ninservice stressor.  If the claimed stressor is related to \r\ncombat, service department evidence that the veteran engaged \r\nin combat or that the veteran was awarded the Purple Heart, \r\nCombat Infantryman Badge, or similar combat citation will be \r\naccepted, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as \r\nconclusive evidence of a claimed inservice stressor.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1996).\r\n\r\nThe threshold question that must be resolved with regard to a \r\nclaim is whether the veteran has presented evidence that the \r\nclaim is well grounded.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a) (West 1991); \r\nMurphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 78, 81 (1990).  A well \r\ngrounded claim is a plausible claim, that is a claim which is \r\nmeritorious on its own or capable of substantiation.  Murphy, \r\n1 Vet. App. at 81.  Mere allegations in support of a claim \r\nthat a disorder should be service-connected are not \r\nsufficient; the veteran must submit evidence in support of \r\nthe claim that would �justify a belief by a fair and \r\nimpartial individual that the claim is plausible.�  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a); Tirpak v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 609, \r\n611 (1992).  The quality and quantity of the evidence \r\nrequired to meet this statutory burden depends upon the issue \r\npresented by the claim.  Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, \r\n92-93 (1993).  \r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Veterans Appeals (Court) has held \r\nthat the basic elements of a well grounded claim for service \r\nconnection and the type of evidence required to meet each \r\nelement are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1)  Competent evidence of current disability (medical \r\ndiagnosis); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 144 \r\n(1992); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992);\r\n(2)  Evidence of incurrence or aggravation of disease or \r\ninjury in service (lay or medical evidence); Cartwright v. \r\nDerwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. \r\nApp. 465 (1994); and\r\n(3)  Evidence of a nexus between the in-service injury or \r\ndisease and the current disability (Medical evidence or \r\npresumption that certain disabilities manifest within certain \r\nperiods are related to service); Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. \r\nApp. 91, 93; Lathan v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 359 (1995).\r\n\r\nCaluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995).\r\n\r\nThe Court has further held that a lay person is not competent \r\nto make a medical diagnosis or to relate a medical disorder \r\nto a specific cause.  See Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. \r\n492, 494 (1992).  Therefore, if the issue is one of medical \r\netiology or a medical diagnosis, competent medical evidence \r\nmust be submitted to make the claim well-grounded.  See \r\nGrottveit at 93.\r\n\r\nIf the veteran fails to submit a well grounded claim, the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) is under no duty to \r\nassist in any further development of the claim.  Id.  \r\nFurthermore, a claim that is not well grounded must be \r\ndenied.\r\n\r\nThe Court in Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91 (1993) set \r\nforth the foundation for the framework now established by the \r\ncase law for establishing the presence of a recognizable \r\nstressor, which is the essential prerequisite to support the \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD.  The Court noted that the evidence \r\nnecessary to establish the existence of the recognizable \r\nstressor during service will vary depending on whether or not \r\nthe veteran was �engaged in combat with the enemy� under \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West 1991) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.304 \r\n(1996).  Whether or not a veteran \"engaged in combat with the \r\nenemy\" must be determined through recognized military \r\ncitations or other service department evidence.  In other \r\nwords, the claimant's bare assertions that he \"engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy\" are not sufficient, by themselves, to \r\nestablish this fact.  The record must first contain \r\nrecognized military citations or other supportive evidence to \r\nestablish that he \"engaged in combat with the enemy.\"  If the \r\ndetermination with respect to this step is affirmative, then \r\n(and only then), a second step requires that the veteran's \r\nlay testimony regarding claimed stressors must be accepted as \r\nconclusive as to their actual occurrence and no further \r\ndevelopment or corroborative evidence will be required, \r\nprovided that the veteran's testimony is found to be \r\n\"satisfactory,\" e.g., credible, and \"consistent with the \r\ncircumstances, conditions, or hardships of such service.\"  \r\nZarycki at 98 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nIn an elaboration and clarification of Zarycki, the Court \r\nnoted in Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389 (1996), that \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(1996) requires three elements to support \r\nan award of service connection for PTSD:  (1) a current \r\nmedical diagnosis of PTSD; (2) medical evidence of a causal \r\nnexus between current symptomatology and the claimed in-\r\nservice stressor; and (3) credible supporting evidence that \r\nthe claimed in service stressor occurred.  The Court pointed \r\nout that since Zarycki, as well as Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. \r\nApp. 283 (1994) and West v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 70 (1994), \r\nchanges in VA ADJUDICATION PROCEDURE MANUAL M21-1 [hereafter \r\nMANUAL M-21-1] had rendered certain portions of those \r\ndecisions no longer operative insofar as they were grounded \r\nin subsequently revised manual provisions.  Further, the \r\nCourt had held in Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 166 \r\n(1996) as a matter of law that �if the claimed stressor is \r\nnot combat-related, [the] appellants lay testimony regarding \r\nthe in-service stressors is insufficient to establish the \r\noccurrence of the stressor.�\r\n\r\nIn Moreau, the Court, citing the MANUAL M21-1 Part VA,  \r\n7.46.c (Oct. 11, 1995) held that �credible supporting \r\nevidence� of a noncombat stressor �may be obtained from� \r\nservice records or �other sources.�   The Court, however, \r\nalso held that while the MANUAL M21-1 provisions did not \r\nexpressly state whether the veteran�s testimony standing \r\nalone could constitute credible evidence of the actual \r\noccurrence of a noncombat stressor, the Court�s holding in \r\nDizoglio mandated that the veteran�s testimony by itself \r\ncould not constitute �credible supporting evidence� of the \r\nactual existence of the noncombat stressor.  Further, the \r\nCourt held in Moreau, the fact that a medical opinion was \r\nprovided relating PTSD to events the veteran described in \r\nservice could not constitute �credible supporting evidence� \r\nof the existence of the claimed noncombat stressor.\r\n\r\nIn West v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 70 (1994), the Court further \r\nelaborated on an essential element in establishing the \r\nadequacy of the verified event (stressor) to produce PTSD.  \r\nIn Zarycki, the Court held that in addition to demonstrating \r\nthe existence of a stressor, the facts must also establish \r\nthat the alleged stressful event was sufficient to give rise \r\nto PTSD.  Id. at 98-99.  In West, the Court held that the \r\nsufficiency of the stressor is a medical determination, and \r\ntherefore adjudicators may not render a determination on this \r\npoint in the absence of independent medical evidence.  The \r\nCourt also held in West that a psychiatric examination for \r\nthe purpose of establishing the existence of PTSD was \r\ninadequate for rating purposes because the examiners relied, \r\nin part, on events whose existence the Board had rejected.\r\n\r\nIn Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997), the Court noted \r\nthat the VA had adopted a final rule in October 1996, \r\neffective November 7, 1996, revising 38 C.F.R. �� 4.125 and \r\n4.126 (1996).  The effect of these revisions was to change \r\nthe diagnostic criteria for mental disorders from the \r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM), \r\nthird edition and the third edition, revised, to the fourth \r\nedition (DSM-IV).  The Court found that DSM-IV altered the \r\ncriteria for assessing the adequacy of the stressor from an \r\nobjective to a subjective basis.  The Court further found \r\nthat where there was �undisputed, unequivocal� diagnoses of \r\nPTSD of record, and the Board did not make a finding that the \r\nreports were incomplete, the adequacy of the stressor had to \r\nbe presumed as a matter of law.  The Court noted that \r\n�although it is not necessary to its decision here,� the \r\ndiagnoses of PTSD appeared to comport with the diagnostic \r\ncriteria for PTSD.  Id. at 144.  (The concurring opinion goes \r\nfurther and states that the case also holds that where there \r\nis an �unequivocal� diagnosis of PTSD, the adequacy of the \r\nsymptoms to support the diagnosis, as well as the sufficiency \r\nof the stressor, are presumed.  Id. at 153) The governing \r\nregulation provides that if the Board, or other adjudicators, \r\ndoubts whether the diagnosis of a mental disorder is \r\nsubstantiated, including as to whether the diagnostic \r\ncriteria are met, or indeed rejects the diagnosis shown on \r\nexamination, the case should be returned to the examiner for \r\nclarification.  38 C.F.R. � 4.126 (1996).\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that, upon review of Zarycki, Moreau, West, \r\nand Cohen it is clear that, in approaching a claim for \r\nservice connection for PTSD, the question of the existence \r\nand character of an event claimed as a recognizable stressor \r\nis a matter solely within the providence of adjudicatory \r\npersonnel.  If the adjudicators, having given due \r\nconsideration to all matters of credibility raised by the \r\nrecord, conclude that the record establishes the existence \r\nand character of such an alleged stressor or stressors, then \r\nand only then, the resolution of a claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD moves forward to the questions of whether \r\nthe event (or events) was sufficient to constitute a stressor \r\nfor purposes of causing PTSD, and whether the remaining \r\nelements required to support the diagnosis of PTSD have been \r\nmet.  The adequacy of the event claimed as a stressor and the \r\nquestion of whether the diagnostic criteria for PTSD have \r\nbeen met are matters that require the input of competent \r\nmedical evidence.\r\n\r\nThe Board further notes that under Collette v. Brown, 82 F.3d \r\n389 (Fed.Cir. 1996) and Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 \r\n(1995), the correct application of 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) \r\nrequires a three-step, sequential analysis:\r\n\r\n(1)  Has the claimant produced �satisfactory lay or other \r\nevidence of such injury or disease.�  �Satisfactory evidence� \r\nis defined as �credible evidence that would a allow a \r\nreasonable fact finder to conclude that the alleged injury or \r\ndisease was incurred in or aggravated by the veteran�s combat \r\nservice.�\r\n(2)  Is the proffered evidence �consistent with the \r\ncircumstances, conditions, or hardships of such service.�  \r\n(3)  Once these the first two steps are met, the Secretary \r\n�shall accept� the veteran�s evidence as �sufficient proof of \r\nservice connection,� even if no official record of such \r\nincurrence exists, unless the government can met the burden \r\nof showing �clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.�  \r\n\r\nIn Collette, it was expressly held that during the first two \r\nsteps of this sequential analysis, the credibility \r\ndetermination must be made as to the veteran�s evidence \r\nstanding alone, not weighing the veteran�s evidence with \r\ncontrary evidence.  Only in the third step may contrary \r\nevidence, such as a Report of Medical Examination at \r\nSeparation, be brought into play.  Collette, 82 F.3d at 393.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the Board finds that the critical issues with \r\nrespect to the veteran�s claim for service connection for \r\nPTSD in this appeal involve the questions of whether there is \r\nmedical evidence of a clear diagnosis of PTSD and whether the \r\nveteran �engaged in combat with the enemy� or there is \r\n�credible supporting evidence� of the occurrence of alleged \r\nin-service stressor(s).  Accordingly, the Board will address \r\nthe evidence related to these questions and then analyze that \r\nevidence.  In setting forth that evidence, the Board will set \r\nout the record primarily with respect to areas that bear upon \r\nthe existence of a diagnosis of PTSD and the alleged in-\r\nservice stressor.\r\n\r\nThe veteran�s personnel file reflects that after his initial \r\nbasic training, the veteran was assigned as a cannoneer to \r\nBattery B, 5th Battalion, 4th Artillery in the 1st Brigade of \r\nthe 5th Infantry Division, Mechanized.  The personnel records \r\nfurther indicate that the veteran was awarded the Bronze Star \r\nMedal following service in Vietnam.  The veteran�s DD 214 \r\nshows active service from March 1970 to November 1971, and \r\nindicates that the veteran had 10 months, and 27 days of \r\nforeign and/or sea service, and shows awards of the National \r\nDefense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal with one Bronze \r\nService Star, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, Bronze Star \r\nMedal, and Marksman citation for the M-16 rifle.  He has no \r\nawards or decorations specific to combat, appropriate to his \r\nbranch of service.\r\n\r\nNone of the veteran�s service records discloses any reference \r\nto an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, by \r\ncomplaints, statements of medical history or clinical \r\nfindings.  At the separation medical examination in October \r\n1971, no history of an in-service psychiatric disorder was \r\nrecorded, and there were no findings at that time associated \r\nwith psychiatric examination.\r\n\r\nIn his original application for compensation or pension in \r\nDecember 1972, the veteran did not make a claim for service \r\nconnection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, and in a \r\nsubsequent application in August 1975, the veteran sought \r\nservice connection for bilateral hearing loss.  Moreover, at \r\nhis VA medical examination in November 1975, the veteran did \r\nnot relate complaints with respect to any psychiatric \r\ndisorder and no service stressors were identified.\r\n\r\nThe first medical evidence which notes that the veteran had \r\nreportedly been exposed to stressful experiences in service \r\nis a private disability evaluation report from Dr. E. F. W., \r\ndated in October 1994, which reflects that the veteran had a \r\nhistory of alcoholism and lead toxicity, and that he was a 13 \r\nmonth Vietnam front-line combat veteran.  The veteran further \r\nreported that he experienced constant combat duty during his \r\n13 months in Vietnam, and that during this period he became \r\nsocially withdrawn and developed a hearing loss.  At point-\r\nblank range, he was sometimes required to fire �flechette� \r\nrounds at enemy troops which were extremely destructive.  He \r\nwas also sometimes placed on graves detail, which involved \r\nthe retrieval of both friendly and enemy soldiers following \r\ncombat.  When he returned home after Vietnam, the veteran was \r\nquite withdrawn.  He initially worked for several timber \r\ncompanies and as a lead salvage specialist from 1980 to 1992.\r\n\r\nMental status examination at this time revealed that that his \r\nmood varied form unremarkable to mildly sad.  There was no \r\nevidence of hallucinations or delusions of grandeur, and the \r\nveteran denied unwanted thoughts or sleep difficulty.  The \r\nveteran�s first intoxication occurred during military \r\nservice, and he had been treated at the VA Hospital in Walla \r\nWalla, Washington in 1992 for both substance abuse and lead \r\ntoxicity.  The examiner noted that certain test results \r\nreflected that the veteran had a valid profile but that there \r\nwas a negative impression management style.  The diagnostic \r\nimpression under DSM-IV included the ruling out of chronic \r\nPTSD.\r\n\r\nA January 1995 VA social and industrial survey report \r\nindicates that the veteran reported a history of nightmares \r\nat the rate of about one a month, and that he experienced \r\nthoughts of Vietnam approximately twice a week.  He related \r\nbeing on grave duty in Vietnam, at which time he collected \r\nbodies and body parts and placed them into plastic bags.  \r\nLoud noise and other circumstances will irritate him or \r\ntrigger thought of Vietnam.  The veteran reported that he had \r\npositive working relationships with his peers and superiors.  \r\nIn Vietnam, the veteran reported that he was a cannoneer with \r\nthe �54th� Artillery, B Battery, and that it was his \r\nresponsibility to load/unload, clean fuses, set fuses, hump \r\npowder, and fill in for whatever needed to be done.  He was \r\nexposed to mortar and rocket fire, sniper fire while on grave \r\nduty, booby traps, and witnessed the killing of three friends \r\nby booby traps in which the veteran had the responsibility of \r\nrecovering body fragments.  The veteran reported that he \r\nparticipated in grave detail around the perimeter about twice \r\na week, and that the bodies were often found in a state of \r\ndecomposition.\r\n\r\nThe assessment was that the veteran had been subject to \r\nsignificant war zone related traumatic experiences, and that \r\nhe had limited insight as to how these had affected his \r\nadjustment to civilian life.  It was further noted that the \r\nveteran had presented some PTSD related issues that included \r\nintrusive thinking, but denied sleep related problems, and \r\nhad only occasional nightmares.  \r\n\r\nA January 1995 VA PTSD examination revealed that the veteran \r\nreported that he lived by himself in a 20 foot trailer, and \r\ndenied any psychological or psychiatric problems.  He further \r\nreported that in Vietnam, he was exposed to artillery and \r\nshrapnel which was very traumatic for him.  He described \r\nhaving nightmares once every three or four months.  Mental \r\nstatus examination revealed that the veteran was cooperative \r\nand was quite content with his life as it had developed.  The \r\nveteran reported that he gets along with others, and that he \r\nhad intrusive memories about Vietnam.  The diagnostic \r\nimpression included a possibility of PTSD with obvious \r\nunderlying problems such as alcoholism in the past.  The \r\nexaminer went on to note that psychosocial stressors had been \r\naccumulating through the years, starting with dehumanizing \r\nexperiences in Vietnam, exposure to high noise during combat, \r\nexposure to lead with subsequent lead poisoning, multiple \r\nconcussions, and alcohol exposure.  The examiner further \r\nnoted that the veteran had a history of moderately severe \r\npsychosocial stressors since his military years, and that \r\nalthough the possibility of mild PTSD was also a \r\nconsideration, the veteran had been able to repress it quite \r\neffectively through the years.  A Global Assessment of \r\nFunction scale (GAF) code of 45 was assigned which the \r\nexaminer noted to be considerable.\r\n\r\nA May 1995 letter from the regional office (RO) to the \r\nveteran requested additional information regarding the \r\nveteran�s claimed stressors, and a copy was also furnished to \r\nthe veteran�s service representative.  The appellant did not \r\nrespond to this request.\r\n\r\nAt the veteran�s personal hearing in January 1997, the \r\nveteran testified that in Vietnam, he was involved in the \r\noperation of �155 Howertzer�s� which were mounted on tracks \r\n(transcript (T.) at pp. 2-3).  There were a couple of times \r\nthat his battalion was hit on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and the \r\nveteran�s unit sustained casualties, which included a friend \r\nby the name of Jack Dunce (T. at pp. 3-4).  The veteran \r\nacknowledged that there was no record of the veteran�s friend \r\nmissing in action and that the veteran was awarded the Bronze \r\nStar Medal for the period in which his unit received mortar \r\nrounds on the Ho Chi Minh Trail (T. at p. 4).  The veteran \r\nstated that of the six guns in his battery, only one was \r\ndestroyed, and that was the one his friend was in when he was \r\nkilled in action (T. at p. 5).  The veteran noted that a Dr. \r\nW. had examined him in 1994 and reached certain diagnoses (T. \r\nat p. 6).  In 1992, the veteran had received some treatment \r\nfor alcoholism from the VA Hospital in Walla, Walla, \r\nWashington (T. at p. 6).  Watching TV will sometimes trigger \r\nmemories of Vietnam (T. at p. 7).  \r\n\r\nAn April 1997 VA PTSD examination revealed that the veteran \r\nreported that he was sleeping satisfactorily and did not \r\nexperience nightmares.  The veteran reportedly saw combat in \r\nVietnam as an artillery gunner and cannoneer, and experienced \r\nincoming mortars and other rocket attack, from which there \r\nwere casualties.  Some of the more traumatic experiences were \r\nnoted to involve the veteran�s role with the �54th� Artillery \r\non the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos.  The examiner noted the \r\nveteran�s receipt of Vietnam ribbons and the Bronze Star.  \r\nEvery once in a while the veteran would day dream presumably \r\nabout his combat exposure.  The diagnosis included alcohol \r\ndependence, now in sound remission, and dementia related to \r\nlead poisoning, but no PTSD.  The examiner went on to comment \r\nthat despite the veteran�s reported exposure to sustained \r\ncombat, including rocket attacks and mortars, there was not \r\nmuch information supportive of a PTSD disability.  If the \r\nveteran exhibited PTSD, the examiner believed that it was not \r\ndisabling or prominent in the veteran�s ongoing existence.  \r\nThe examiner concluded that while the veteran may be disabled \r\nby lead poisoning and dementia, disability \r\ndirectly/exclusively related to PTSD was not supported by the \r\ninterview or other material made available to the examiner at \r\nthe time of this examination.\r\n\r\nAn August 1997 letter from the RO to the veteran notified the \r\nveteran that he could still submit additional evidence in \r\nsupport of his claim on appeal.\r\n\r\nThe record shows that the RO advised the veteran explicitly \r\nthat Jack Dunce did not appear on the list of service members \r\nkilled in Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  Analysis\r\n\r\nClear Diagnosis of PTSD\r\n\r\nThe Board has considered the evidence relevant to this claim, \r\nand first notes that the record shows that the veteran did \r\nnot have an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, \r\nin service, at the time of his terminal service medical \r\nexamination, nor was it manifest to any degree within one \r\nyear of separation from service.   Moreover, the existence of \r\nan acquired psychiatric disorder for which compensation \r\nbenefits are provided, to include a diagnosis of  PTSD \r\nmeeting the regulatory criteria, has not been shown by \r\ncompetent, i.e., medical, evidence at any time.  See Espiritu \r\nv. Derwinski, supra.  \r\n\r\nWith respect specifically to a claim for service connection \r\nfor PTSD, the controlling regulation requires medical \r\nevidence establishing a clear diagnosis of the condition and \r\ncredible supporting evidence that the claimed inservice \r\nstressor actually occurred, and a link, established by \r\nmedical evidence, between current symptomatology and the \r\nclaimed inservice stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1996).  In \r\nthis case, several examiners suggest possible PTSD or that \r\nthe diagnosis of PTSD must be ruled out.  None of them, \r\nhowever, rendered a �clear diagnosis.�  Moreover, the RO \r\nexpressly requested a VA psychiatric examination to address \r\nwhether a clear diagnosis of PTSD was obtainable.  That \r\nexaminer determined that PTSD was not currently present.  \r\nThus, one element of a well grounded claim, competent \r\nevidence of current disability (medical diagnosis), is \r\nlacking here.  Rabideau v. Derwinski, supra; Brammer v. \r\nDerwinski, supra.  Moreover, the record fails to reflect a \r\nclear diagnosis of PTSD such as required to meet the \r\nrequirements of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nStressor(s) in Service \r\n\r\nWith respect to the issue of the existence of verified in-\r\nservice stressors, the Board notes that the veteran served in \r\nthe United States Army from March 1970 to November 1971.  \r\nService records indicate that he received the National \r\nDefense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal with one Bronze \r\nService Star, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, Bronze Star \r\nMedal, and Marksman citation for the M-16 rifle.  There is \r\nnothing in the record that indicates that the veteran�s \r\nperformance of his assigned duties was less than highly \r\nsatisfactory, and nothing in this decision is intended to \r\nchallenge the quality of the service rendered.\r\n\r\nThis matter, however, does not turn on the general \r\nproposition that the appellant satisfactorily performed his \r\nassigned duties in service, including any duties carried out \r\nin Vietnam.  This is a specific claim for PTSD and, as such, \r\nrequires not a general passing on overall performance of \r\nassigned duties, but an explicit scrutiny of all the events \r\nin service, including those in Southeast Asia, that are now \r\nclaimed as �stressors.�  The starting point for any \r\ndetermination with regard to PTSD is one or more �stressors.�  \r\nUnder the controlling regulation, there must be credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed service stressor \r\nactually occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  The existence of a \r\nan event alleged as a �stressor� that results in PTSD, though \r\nnot the adequacy of the alleged event to cause PTSD, is an \r\nadjudicative, not a medical determination.  Zarycki v. Brown, \r\n6 Vet. App. 91 (1993).\r\n\r\n(a)  �Conclusive Evidence� (Presumptive Corroboration) of an \r\nAlleged Combat Stressor\r\n\r\nUnder the framework established in Zarycki, the Board must \r\nmake an explicit determination as to whether the appellant \r\n�engaged in combat with the enemy.�  This in turn requires as \r\na preliminary matter examination of whether the record \r\nalready contains �conclusive evidence� that he �engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy.�  By rule making, the VA has set \r\nforward criteria of �conclusive evidence� to establish a \r\ncombat related stressor.  These criteria are defined as: (a) \r\na claim that the stressor is related to combat and (b) a \r\ndemonstration in the record that the claimant (�in the \r\nabsence of evidence to the contrary�) has been awarded \r\ncertain specific recognized awards or decorations identified \r\nin 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) or VA ADJUDICATION MANUAL M21-1, Part \r\nVI,  7.46 (effective Oct. 11. 1995).  The Board notes the \r\nrevised version of this Manual M21-1 provision (Part VI,  \r\n11.37 (effective Feb. 13, 1997) did  not alter the list of \r\nawards or decorations.  These include certain awards \r\nspecifically denoting combat participation (the Combat \r\nInfantryman Badge and the Combat Action Ribbon), a decoration \r\nawarded for combat incurred wounds (the Purple Heart Medal), \r\nand certain decorations that are awarded only for valor in \r\ncombat with the enemy.  The record clearly establishes that \r\nthe claimant was not authorized any of these awards or \r\ndecorations.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the criteria based upon certain awards or \r\ndecorations, �conclusive evidence� may also be established by \r\n�other supportive evidence� that the claimant was a prisoner \r\nof war under the requirements of 38 C.F.R. � 3.1(y), or \r\nevidence that the claimant was in a plane crash, ship \r\nsinking, explosion, rape or assault, or duty on a burn ward \r\nor in a graves registration unit.  The Board finds the term \r\n�other supportive evidence� is unclear as to the limitations, \r\nif any, on what can constitute �other supportive evidence.�  \r\nAt a minimum, the case law from the Court, noted below, would \r\npreclude the use of the claimant�s own assertions as �other \r\nsupporting evidence,� nor would post-service medical evidence \r\nsuffice as �other supporting evidence.�  To the extent that \r\nthe term �other supporting evidence� in this context could be \r\nservice department records, the Board finds that there are no \r\nservice department medical or administrative records to \r\nestablish that the claimant was a prisoner of war under the \r\nrequirements of 38 C.F.R. � 3.1(y), or he was in a plane \r\ncrash, ship sinking, explosion, rape or assault, or duty on a \r\nburn ward or in a graves registration unit.  \r\n\r\nThus, the Board finds that the record does not contain \r\n�conclusive evidence� that he �engaged in combat with the \r\nenemy� and is therefore entitled to have his lay statements \r\naccepted without need of further corroboration.  To the \r\nextent that �other supportive evidence� could be other than \r\nservice department records to establish any of the events \r\nlisted under �conclusive evidence,� this matter is addressed \r\nfurther below.\r\n\r\n(b)  �Credible Supporting Evidence� of a Claimed �Stressor�\r\n\r\nWhere the record does not reflect �conclusive evidence� that \r\nthe claimant �engaged in combat with the enemy� under \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b), his assertions, standing alone, can \r\nnot as a matter of law provide evidence to establish that he \r\n�engaged in combat with the enemy� or that an event claimed \r\nas a stressor occurred.  Dizoglio, 9 Vet. App. 163 (1996).  \r\nFurthermore, as a matter of law, �credible supporting \r\nevidence that the claimed in[-]service event actually \r\noccurred� can not be provided by medical opinion based on \r\npost-service examination.  Moreau, 9 Vet. App. 394-96.  This \r\ndoes not mean that the claimant can not still establish that \r\nhe �engaged in combat with the enemy,� and then secure the \r\npresumptions provided under 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b).  It only \r\nmeans that other �credible supporting evidence from any \r\nsource� must be provided that the event alleged as the \r\nstressor in service occurred.  Cohen, 10 Vet. App. at 147.  \r\nThus, the analysis of stressor verification is not so much \r\nbisected by whether the event is �combat� or �noncombat,� but \r\nwhether there is �conclusive evidence� of a combat stressor, \r\nor �credible supporting evidence from any source� of a combat \r\nor noncombat stressor.  \r\n\r\nThe first step in sorting out the evidence at this point is \r\nto identify what the record establishes about the units the \r\nclaimant was assigned to and where those units were in \r\nSoutheast Asia.  Based on the claimant�s service \r\nadministrative records, the Board finds that the veteran unit \r\nwas, in fact, involved in providing artillery support in \r\nVietnam.  The Board notes, however, that there is no service \r\ndepartment record linking the veteran directly to an event \r\ninvolving unit casualties or destruction of unit vehicles or \r\nequipment due to enemy fire.\r\n\r\nAmong the accounts the appellant has presented as events \r\npurported as �stressors,� are the following:\r\n\r\nSeeing combat and comrades killed in action\r\nBeing under fire\r\nExposure to booby traps\r\nGrave detail\r\nExposure to sniper fire\r\n\r\nAs was noted above, in light of the fact that none of the \r\nveteran�s purported stressors had been verified by service \r\nrecords or otherwise, the RO sent a letter to the veteran in \r\nwhich more details were requested, and a copy of the RO�s \r\nletter was also furnished to the veteran�s service \r\nrepresentative.  The record contains no response from the \r\nveteran or his service representative to the correspondence \r\nfrom the RO.  Moreover, the record in this case shows that \r\nthe one event that could be tested against supporting \r\nevidence, the death of a specifically named comrade in \r\nservice, resulted in the conclusion that the evidence refuted \r\nthe veteran�s allegation.  As the Court has pointed out, at a \r\nminimum, the available service records must not contradict \r\nallegations of events in service.  Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. \r\nApp. 283 (1994).  The Board finds this analysis would apply \r\nas well to closely comparable evidence, such as evidence as \r\nto the names of service members killed in Vietnam. \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that as the record stands, none of the above \r\nevents are corroborated by �satisfactory evidence.�  While \r\nthe Board notes that the RO most recently denied the \r\nveteran�s claim in a supplemental statement of the case in \r\nwhich it applied the criteria of DSM-III instead of DSM-IV, \r\nin view of the Board�s finding of the lack of credible \r\nsupporting evidence from any source verifying any event \r\nclaimed as a stressor in this matter, the impact of the RO�s \r\nfailure to consider the criteria of DSM-IV is rendered moot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nThe claim for service connection for PTSD is denied as not \r\nwell grounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tRICHARD B.

Clarkson, III, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from January 1968 to August \r\n1969.  \r\n\r\nAdditional issues of entitlement to service connection for a \r\nskin disorder claimed as due to Agent Orange and entitlement \r\nto a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss were \r\ncertified on appeal to the Board of Veterans� Appeals \r\n(Board), but were withdrawn by the veteran during a hearing \r\nin July 1997.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe appellant contends, in effect, that he has PTSD as a \r\nresult of experiences in Vietnam.  The Board notes that in an \r\nAugust 1967 preinduction  examination report of medical \r\nhistory, the veteran indicated he had been rejected for \r\nmilitary service for �mental� reasons.  It is unclear whether \r\nhe was acknowledging preservice psychiatric problems; and it \r\ndoes not appear that any attempt has been made to clarify \r\nthis. \r\n\r\nAt a July 1997 hearing the veteran asserted that, while \r\nserving in Vietnam in August 1969, his unit (Company �B� of \r\nthe 93rd Engineer Battalion (Construction)) came under enemy \r\nmortar attack at Dong Tam and Moc Hoa.  He testified that in \r\nJuly 1969, he saw a young girl killed when she was run over \r\nby a truck driven by a member of his unit.  \r\n\r\nThe most recent medical treatment records of the veteran date \r\nfrom 1995.  However, at the July 1997 hearing, he indicated \r\nthat he had been receiving treatment for PTSD at the VA \r\nMedical Center (VAMC) in Huntington, West Virginia for the \r\nsix to eight months preceding the hearing.  He also stated \r\nthat prior to his treatment at the VAMC in Huntington, he \r\nreceived treatment for PTSD at the Logan-Mingo Mental Health \r\nClinic in Chattaroy, West Virginia (Logan-Mingo MHC).  \r\nRecords of treatment for PTSD from the VAMC in Huntington and \r\nrecords of treatment at Logan-Mingo MHC after 1995 have not \r\nbeen associated with the claims folder.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, while medical records of treatment of the \r\nveteran from Logan-Mingo MHC which are in the claims folder \r\ninclude a diagnosis of PTSD, reports of VA general medical \r\nand mental examinations from the VAMC in Huntington, do not \r\ninclude a diagnosis of PTSD, except by history.  Therefore, \r\nit is unclear whether the veteran has PTSD or another \r\npsychiatric disorder.  \r\n\r\nVA has a duty to assist the veteran in the development of \r\nfacts pertinent to his claim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a) (West \r\n1991); 38 C.F.R. � 3.103(a) (1996).  The U.S. Court of \r\nVeterans Appeals (Court) has held that the duty to assist the \r\nveteran in obtaining and developing available facts and \r\nevidence to support his claim includes obtaining medical \r\nrecords to which the veteran has referred and obtaining \r\nadequate VA examinations.  The Court has also stated that the \r\nBoard must make a determination as to the adequacy of the \r\nrecord.  Littke v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 90 (1990).  \r\nFulfillment of the statutory duty to assist includes the \r\nconduct of a thorough and contemporaneous medical \r\nexamination, one which takes into account the records of \r\nprior medical treatment, so that the evaluation of the \r\nclaimed disability will be a fully informed one.  Green v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 121 (1991).  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that additional development of the evidence \r\nis required.  Accordingly, the case is REMANDED to the RO for \r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n1.  The veteran should be asked to \r\nprovide detailed information as to \r\nwhether and where he received treatment \r\nfor any mental disorder(s) both prior to \r\nservice and since 1995.  The RO should \r\nobtain complete clinical records of all \r\nsuch treatment.  \r\n\r\n2.  The RO should contact the Director, \r\nNational Archives and Records \r\nAdministration (NARA), attn: NCPMA-O, \r\n9700 Page Boulevard, St. Louis, Missouri \r\n63132, and request morning reports for \r\nthe veteran�s unit: Company �B,� 93rd \r\nEngineer Battalion (Construction), from \r\nJuly to August 1969, to determine whether \r\nthere are any references to the unit \r\ncoming under enemy mortar fire at Dong \r\nTam and/or Moc Hoa and whether a young \r\ncivilian girl was a casualty as a result \r\nof a truck-driving accident involving a \r\nmember of the unit.  \r\n\r\n3.  When the above-requested development \r\nis completed, the veteran should be \r\nafforded a VA psychiatric examination to \r\ndetermine whether he has PTSD based on a \r\nverified stressor and/or the nature and \r\netiology of any other psychiatric \r\ndisorder he may have. If PTSD is \r\ndiagnosed, the examiner must specifically \r\nstate for the record the stressors relied \r\nupon to support the diagnosis.  The \r\nclaims folder must be available to the \r\nexaminer for review in conjunction with \r\nthe examination.  \r\n\r\n4.  The RO should then review the \r\nveteran�s claim to determine whether it \r\nmay be granted.  If it remains denied, \r\nthe veteran and his representative should \r\nbe furnished an appropriate Supplemental \r\nStatement of the Case and given a \r\nreasonable opportunity to respond.  \r\n\r\nThereafter, the case should be returned to the Board for \r\nfurther appellate review, if appropriate.  The veteran need \r\ntake no further action until he is notified.\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment by the RO.  \r\nThe law requires that all claims that are remanded by the \r\nBoard of Veterans� Appeals or by the United States Court of \r\nVeterans Appeals for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee The Veterans� Benefits Improvements Act of 1994, Pub.

F. Chiappetta, Jr., Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty with the Army from March \r\n1964 to March 1966, including service in Vietnam from August \r\n1965 to February 1966.\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans� Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from an April 1995 RO rating decision which denied \r\nthe veteran�s claim for entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD.  The veteran testified at a personal hearing before a \r\nmember of the Board on travel section at the RO in July 1997.  \r\nA transcript of that hearing is on file. \r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe appellant contends that he has PTSD which is related to \r\ntraumatic events he experienced while serving with the Army \r\nin Vietnam from 1965 to 1966.  The claims file includes \r\nmedical evidence showing a current diagnosis of PTSD.  It \r\nappears that the RO has denied the veteran�s claim because of \r\na lack of a verified stressor in service.\r\n\r\nThrough the course of his appeal, the veteran has asserted \r\nthat certain stressful incidents which occurred while serving \r\nin Vietnam led to the development of PTSD.  These are \r\nreported to include: being under life threatening sniper \r\nfire, working as a combat engineer in outlying locations in \r\ndaily fear of Vietcong attack, viewing the aftermath of a \r\nbattle in the Ben Cat area, seeing bodies in bags at an \r\nairport, viewing casualties at the Long Bien field hospital, \r\nand seeing child victims of the war.\r\n\r\nA review of the record indicates that further development \r\nremains to be accomplished.  In particular, although the RO \r\nsent information provided by the veteran in support of his \r\nstressors to the U.S. Army and Joint Services Environmental \r\nSupport Group (ESG) [now renamed the U.S. Armed Services \r\nCenter for Research of Unit Records (USASCRUR)], it does not \r\nappear that a report of its findings has been associated with \r\nthe claims file.  \r\n\r\nAs information in addition to that which was already sent to \r\nthe USASCRUR has now been added to the claims file, the Board \r\nhas determined that the RO should forward to the USASCRUR any \r\nadditional information regarding the veteran's unit of \r\nassignment, and his duties and responsibilities during his \r\ntour in Vietnam, and an account of his particularly stressful \r\nexperiences.  Although the veteran has provided some detailed \r\ninformation regarding the claimed stressors, the RO should \r\nmake an additional request for information and forward this \r\ninformation to the USASCRUR.\r\n\r\nIn adjudicating a claim for service connection for PTSD, the \r\nBoard is required to evaluate the supporting evidence in \r\nlight of the places, types, and circumstances of service, as \r\nevidenced by the veteran's military records, and all \r\npertinent medical and lay evidence.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b); \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1993); see Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet.App. \r\n60, 66 (1993).  Additionally, service connection for PTSD \r\nrequires medical evidence establishing a clear diagnosis of \r\nthe condition, credible supporting evidence that the claimed \r\nin-service stressor actually occurred, and a link, \r\nestablished by the medical evidence, between current \r\nsymptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  See \r\nZarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet.App. 91, 97 (1993).\r\n\r\nIn West v. Brown, 7 Vet.App. 70 (1994), the Court elaborated \r\non the analysis in Zarycki.  In Zarycki, the Court held that \r\nin addition to demonstrating the existence of a stressor, the \r\nfacts must also establish that the alleged stressful event \r\nwas sufficient to give rise to PTSD.  In West, the Court held \r\nthat the sufficiency of the stressor is a medical \r\ndetermination, and therefore adjudicators may not render a \r\ndetermination on this point in the absence of independent \r\nmedical evidence.  The Court also held in West that a \r\npsychiatric examination for the purpose of establishing the \r\nexistence of PTSD was inadequate for rating purposes because \r\nthe examiners relied, in part, on events whose existence the \r\nBoard had rejected.   \r\n\r\nUpon reviewing Zarycki and West, it appears that in \r\napproaching a claim for service connection for PTSD, the \r\nquestion of the existence of an event claimed as a \r\nrecognizable stressor must be resolved by adjudicatory \r\npersonnel.  If the adjudicators conclude that the record \r\nestablishes the existence of such a stressor or stressors, \r\nthen, and only then, the case should be referred for a \r\nmedical examination to determine the sufficiency of the \r\nstressor and whether the remaining elements required to \r\nsupport the diagnosis of PTSD have been met.  In such a \r\nreferral, the adjudicators should specify to the examiner(s) \r\nprecisely what stressors have been accepted as established by \r\nthe record, and the medical examiner(s) must be instructed \r\nthat only those events may be considered in determining \r\nwhether stressors to which the veteran was exposed during \r\nservice were of sufficient severity as to have resulted in \r\ncurrent psychiatric symptoms.  In other words, if the \r\nadjudicators determine that the existence of an alleged \r\nstressor or stressors in service is not established by the \r\nrecord, a medical examination to determine whether PTSD due \r\nto service is present is pointless.  Likewise, if the \r\nexaminer(s) render a diagnosis of PTSD that is not clearly \r\nbased upon stressors in service whose existence the \r\nadjudicators have accepted, the examination would be \r\ninadequate for rating purposes. \r\n\r\nThe Board also directs the RO to the recent decision of the \r\nCourt in Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet.App. 128 (1997) in which the \r\nCourt set out guidelines for PTSD claims.\r\n\r\nIn view of the foregoing, it is the Board�s judgment that the \r\nRO should obtain additional information from the veteran \r\nregarding his alleged in-service stressors and forward this \r\ninformation to the USASCRUR for verification of the \r\nstressors.  If indicated, the RO should then schedule a VA \r\npsychiatric examination.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is hereby REMANDED for the following \r\nactions:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should take appropriate action \r\nto contact the veteran and request the \r\nnames, addresses, and approximate dates \r\nof treatment of all health care providers \r\n(VA and non-VA) who have treated him for \r\npsychiatric problems prior to, during, \r\nand after service. When the veteran \r\nresponds and provides any necessary \r\nauthorizations, the named health care \r\nproviders should be contacted and asked \r\nto submit copies of all medical records \r\ndocumenting their treatment which are not \r\nalready in the claims folder.  All \r\nrecords obtained should be associated \r\nwith the claims folder. \r\n\r\n2.  The RO should request from the \r\nveteran a comprehensive statement \r\ncontaining as much detail as possible \r\nregarding the stressors to which he \r\nalleges he was exposed in service.  The \r\nveteran should be asked to provide \r\nspecific details of the claimed stressful \r\nevents during service, such as dates, \r\nplaces, detailed descriptions of events \r\nand identifying information concerning \r\nany other individuals involved in the \r\nevents, including their names, ranks, \r\nunits of assignment or any other \r\nidentifying detail.  The veteran is \r\nadvised that this information is vitally \r\nnecessary to obtain supportive evidence \r\nof the stressful events and that he must \r\nbe as specific as possible because \r\nwithout such details an adequate search \r\nfor verifying information cannot be \r\nconducted. \r\n\r\n3.  With the additional information \r\nobtained and the evidence currently of \r\nrecord, the RO should review the file and \r\nprepare a summary of all the claimed \r\nstressors.  This summary, together with a \r\ncopy of the DD 214 and the DA Form 20, or \r\nequivalent, and all associated documents, \r\nshould be sent to the USASCRUR, 7798 \r\nCissna Road, Springfield, Virginia 22150.  \r\nThey should again be requested to provide \r\nany information that might corroborate \r\nthe veteran's alleged stressors. \r\n\r\n4.  If, and only if, the RO determines \r\nthat the record establishes the existence \r\nof a stressor or stressors, then the RO \r\nshould arrange for the veteran to be \r\naccorded a VA psychiatric examination to \r\ndetermine the diagnosis of all \r\npsychiatric disorders that are present.  \r\nThe RO must specify for the examiner the \r\nstressor or stressors that it has \r\ndetermined are established by the record \r\nand the examiner must be instructed that \r\nonly those events may be considered for \r\nthe purpose of determining whether \r\nexposure to a stressor in service has \r\nresulted in current psychiatric symptoms \r\nand, whether the diagnostic criteria to \r\nsupport the diagnosis of PTSD have been \r\nsatisfied.  The examination report should \r\nreflect review of pertinent material in \r\nthe claims folder.  The examiner should \r\nintegrate any previous psychiatric \r\nfindings and diagnoses with current \r\nfindings to obtain a true picture of the \r\nnature of the veteran's psychiatric \r\nstatus.  If the diagnosis of PTSD is \r\ndeemed appropriate, the examiner should \r\ncomment upon the link between the current \r\nsymptomatology and one or more of the in-\r\nservice stressors found to be established \r\nby the RO.  The report of examination \r\nshould include the complete rationale for \r\nall opinions expressed.  All necessary \r\nspecial studies or tests, to include \r\npsychological testing and evaluation, \r\nsuch as the Mississippi Scale for Combat-\r\nRelated post- traumatic stress disorders, \r\nshould be accomplished.  The claims \r\nfolder, or copies of all pertinent \r\nrecords, must be made available to the \r\nexaminer for review in connection with \r\nthe examination.\r\n\r\n5.  The RO should then review the record \r\nand the claim should be readjudicated.  \r\nIf the determination remains adverse to \r\nthe veteran, both he and his \r\nrepresentative should be provided a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case which \r\nincludes a summary of additional evidence \r\nsubmitted, any additional applicable laws \r\nand regulations, and the reasons for the \r\ndecision.

A. Holihan, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from June 1963 to June \r\n1983.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans� Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from the August 1995 Department of Veterans Affairs \r\n(VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decision which denied \r\nservice connection for `PTSD, granted service connection for \r\nparoxysmal atrial tachycardia, assigned a 10 percent \r\ndisability evaluation, and granted an increased evaluation to \r\n30 percent for the veteran�s service-connected low back \r\ndisorder.  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the veteran, in his statement dated in \r\nFebruary, 1995, alleged that he was unable to attain gainful \r\nemployment due to the combination of his service-connected \r\nlow back disability and the frequent panic attacks.  As this \r\ncould be inferred as a claim for total disability benefits \r\nbased on individual unemployability or pension benefits, the \r\nBoard refers this matter to the RO for appropriate action.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn an outpatient treatment report dated in November 1994, a \r\nservice department physician expressed the opinion that the \r\nveteran had PTSD.  In December 1994, the same physician \r\nreported only an impression of panic attacks.  In September \r\n1995, a licensed counselor reported that the veteran had \r\nexperienced a flash back of an event experienced in Vietnam.  \r\nThe veteran has reported various stressors experienced while \r\nserving in Vietnam.  A service acquaintance has supplied a \r\nstatement dated in January 1997, which could be viewed as \r\ncorroborating one of the veteran�s reported stressors.  See \r\nSouzzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307 (1997).  The United States \r\nCourt of Veterans Appeals (Court) has provided detailed \r\nguidance for the development of claims for service connection \r\nfor PTSD once the veteran has satisfied the initial burden of \r\nestablishing a well-grounded claim.  Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. \r\nApp. 91 (1993).  \r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\nestablishing a clear diagnosis of the condition, credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor \r\nactually occurred, and a link, established by medical \r\nevidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed in-\r\nservice stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1996).  In addition, \r\nthe Court has articulated that, in addressing claims for \r\nservice connection for PTSD, consideration must first be \r\ngiven to the evidence required to demonstrate the existence \r\nof an alleged stressor, and then, if such stressor is found, \r\na determination as to whether it is of the quality required \r\nto support a diagnosis of PTSD must be made.  See Zarycki v. \r\nBrown, 6 Vet. App. 91; West v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 70 (1994).  \r\nIn West, the Court held that the sufficiency of the stressor \r\nis a medical determination, and therefore adjudicators may \r\nnot render a determination on this point in the absence of \r\nindependent medical evidence.  \r\n\r\nThe evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a \r\nrecognizable stressor during service to support a claim of \r\nentitlement to service connection for PTSD will vary \r\ndepending on whether or not the veteran was �engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy.�  If the claimed stressor is related \r\nto combat, service department evidence that the veteran \r\nengaged in combat or that the veteran was awarded the Purple \r\nHeart, Combat Infantryman Badge, or similar combat citation \r\nwill be accepted, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, \r\nas conclusive evidence of the claimed in-service stressor.  \r\nSee 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  If the evidence does not show that \r\nhe was engaged in combat with the enemy or that the claimed \r\nstressors are related to such combat, there must be \r\ncorroborative evidence of the claimed stressor.  See Zarycki \r\nv. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91.  \r\n\r\nIn the case at hand, the veteran�s service records do not \r\nshow an award of any combat citation, however, there is \r\nevidence of record suggesting that the veteran may have been \r\nengaged in combat.  The veteran�s service records indicate \r\nthat he served as an air traffic controller operations \r\nofficer and a �pathfinder� in the Republic of Vietnam from \r\nDecember 1968 to November 1969.  The Board notes that the \r\nclaims file does not contain a copy of the veteran�s DD-214 \r\nfor the period prior to December 1971, however, the DD-214 on \r\nfile does contain a list of awards and commendations, as well \r\nas other pertinent information regarding the veteran�s prior \r\nperiod of service. \r\n\r\nThe veteran�s available service medical records do not \r\nindicate that he was treated for any psychological complaints \r\nor illness during service.  However, the veteran�s \r\nrepresentative has argued in the Informal Hearing \r\nPresentation, dated in October 1997, that the veteran�s \r\ncomplete service medical records have not been obtained, and \r\nthat he was treated during service for psychiatric problems \r\nwhile receiving inpatient treatment for low back pain, in \r\nFebruary and March 1969.  Complete inpatient treatment \r\nrecords from these periods are not of record, but \r\ninformational cover sheets are included in veteran�s service \r\nmedical records, confirming hospitalization for low back pain \r\nwhile in Vietnam. \r\n\r\nThe veteran has identified several stressful events which \r\noccurred during his tour of duty in Vietnam.  The veteran \r\nalso alleges that he was involved in combat with the enemy, \r\nand the Board notes that the veteran�s service records \r\nsuggest that the veteran may have been exposed to combat \r\nwhile in Vietnam, however combat service has not been \r\nconfirmed, and thus the veteran is not yet entitled to a \r\nlighter burden of proof with regard to verification of his \r\nclaimed stressors.  The veteran has supplied the RO with \r\ninformation, in the form of written submissions and testimony \r\nat a personal hearing, identifying his assignments while in \r\nVietnam, and the events he contends led to his claimed \r\ndisability.\r\n\r\nThroughout service in Vietnam, the veteran was assigned to \r\nthe 8th Aerial Port Squadron in Tan Son Nhut Airfield, \r\nSaigon, Vietnam, were he served as a staff sergeant and a \r\ncombat controller (also called a �pathfinder�).  His duties \r\nrequired him to travel throughout the country, assisting with \r\nthe movement of supplies for use in combat.  According to the \r\nveteran, the responsibility of resupplying combat units often \r\ninvolved exposure to combat, and other dangerous or stressful \r\nexperiences.  Specifically, the veteran identified the \r\nfollowing stressors, which he alleges are the cause of his \r\nclaimed PTSD:  Throughout his tour in Vietnam, the veteran�s \r\nunit was responsible for loading the bodies of dead U.S. \r\nservicemen into helicopters and flying them to the mortuary \r\nin Bien Hoa or Saigon;  The veteran�s unit was attacked by \r\nthe enemy with mortars, in December 1968, while at Moc Hoa, \r\nVietnam.  The veteran was in his bunk at the time, and after \r\nthe attack, he found that his flight vest, which was hanging \r\njust above his bunk, had been pierced by mortar fragments \r\n(Transcript,. p.3);  In mid-May 1969, at Tam Ky Airport, in \r\nVietnam, a Cobra helicopter emergency landed at the veteran�s \r\nair strip, and the veteran and others in his unit pulled the \r\ninjured pilot and the gunner from the helicopter.  The \r\nwarrant officer gunner, died in the veteran�s arms, and the \r\npilot was evacuated from the scene with multiple \r\nwounds.(Transcript, pp. 3-6).  The veteran does not know the \r\nname of either man.  The veteran has submitted a statement \r\nfrom a Mr. [redacted], who was also present, and confirms the \r\nveteran�s involvement.  (Statement, dated in January 1997);  \r\nIn March 1969, in or near Katum, Vietnam, while helping to \r\nload heavy equipment (a road grader) under sniper fire, the \r\nveteran witnessed the Army driver back-up over a soldier, \r\nkilling him (Statement dated in February 1996; Transcript, \r\np.4);  In March or April of 1969, in Song Be, Vietnam, the \r\nveteran�s unit came under rocket and small arms attack from \r\nthe enemy, leaving several of the veteran�s unit wounded \r\n(Statement, February 1996).\r\n\r\nThe VA has an affirmative duty to assist the veteran in the \r\ndevelopment of his claim for service-connection for PTSD.  \r\nThus, the RO is obliged to take steps to verify whether any \r\nof the veteran�s stressors, whether claimed to have occurred \r\nin combat, or not, did actually occur.  The veteran has \r\nprovided a statement corroborating the attempted rescue of a \r\nhelicopter gunner and pilot in May 1969, however, other \r\nclaimed stressors should also be verified, if possible.  One \r\nmethod of verifying the veteran�s claimed stressors is to \r\nsolicit the assistance of the U.S. Armed Services Center for \r\nResearch of Unit Records (USASCRUR) (formerly known as the \r\nEnvironmental Support Group (ESG)), in verifying combat \r\nstatus and/or the events described by the veteran.  Though \r\nthe veteran has supplied requested information on several \r\noccasions and in several forms, the RO has not pursued \r\nverification of the information through the USASCRUR because \r\nthe RO has considered the claim to be not well-grounded, and \r\nthus not warranting further development.  As the Board has \r\ndetermined that the claim is well-grounded, such an inquiry \r\nto the USASCRUR is in order.\r\n\r\nAs stated above, the Board�s determination that the veteran�s \r\nclaim for PTSD is well-grounded on the basis of evidence of a \r\npossible current diagnosis of PTSD, as provided by Dr. \r\nPollard and Mr. Vincent.  In the event that the veteran�s \r\nclaims of combat involvement and exposure to combat and/or \r\nnon-combat stressful situations are verified, further \r\ndevelopment of the veteran�s treatment records must be \r\npursued.\r\n\r\nThe veteran claims that he has received treatment for PTSD, \r\nhowever, there is no clear medical diagnosis of PTSD of \r\nrecord.  The veteran has been diagnosed with and treated for \r\nanxiety attacks and a panic disorder, identified as a \r\nmoderate panic disorder with agoraphobia, as well as \r\nparoxysmal atrial tachycardia and low back pain.  The veteran \r\nhas provided no documentation of his treatment for PTSD, \r\nthough he has identified his panic disorder as being related \r\nto PTSD.  The veteran has identified several health care \r\nprofessionals whom he states have treated him for his \r\npsychiatric disorders.  Complete records from these \r\nprofessionals have not been obtained to-date;  these records \r\ninclude records pertaining to the veteran from a Mr. \r\nCourville, of the Midland Vet Center, Mr. Vincent, Counselor, \r\nof Abeline, Texas, and Dr. Pollard, of Dyess Air Force Base, \r\nTexas.  The Board finds that all available medical treatment \r\nrecords pertinent to the veteran�s treatment for PTSD and/or \r\nany other psychiatric condition and/or substance abuse should \r\nbe obtained and considered. \r\n\r\nThe veteran was afforded a VA examination to evaluate him for \r\nPTSD in February 1997.  The examiner concluded that though \r\nthe veteran appeared to have developed symptoms related to \r\nhis panic disorder (without agoraphobia) during active \r\nservice, that any causal relationship to combat experience \r\nwas �tenuous�, and that late-onset PTSD had not yet been \r\nclearly identified in the veteran.  In the event that the RO \r\nis able to verify the veteran�s combat stressors, or non-\r\ncombat stressors, a complete psychiatric evaluation is in \r\norder, as there can be no grant of service connection for \r\nPTSD without sufficient findings of a medical diagnosis based \r\non a verified stressor or stressors.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should contact the veteran \r\nand request that he provide any \r\nnecessary additional information \r\nregarding stressors, the units, dates \r\nand locations of all of his military \r\nassignments while in Vietnam, and \r\ndescribe his duties at each location.  \r\nHe should attempt to identify the date \r\nof each stressor incident, as well as \r\nthe name and/or location of any area \r\nwhere such events took place.  He should \r\nidentify other individuals who were \r\ninvolved in or witnessed the incidents \r\nhe has previously described.  He should \r\nindicate whether the events he claims as \r\nstressors were related to any specific \r\noperations or missions, and if so, name \r\nthem.  He should be asked to provide, to \r\nthe best of his knowledge, detailed \r\naccounts of the incidents involving the \r\nmortar attack on his unit�s post in \r\nDecember 1968, at Moc Hoa;  a Cobra \r\nhelicopter pilot or gunner dying in his \r\narms in May 1969, at Tam Ky Airport;  \r\nbeing under sniper fire and witnessing \r\nthe death of a serviceman by being \r\ncrushed under an Army vehicle in March \r\n1969, in Katum;  and, in March or April \r\nof 1969, coming under rocket and small \r\narms attack in Song Be.  He should \r\ninclude any further information as to \r\nwhere he was when the incidents \r\noccurred, the dates, times, locations, \r\nand witnesses to each, his specific \r\ninvolvement or role in each incident, \r\nthe unit he was assigned at the time of \r\neach claimed incident, and the outcome \r\nof each incident.  Any other claimed \r\nstressors should be similarly detailed.  \r\nThe veteran must be asked to be as \r\nspecific as possible because, without \r\nsuch details, an adequate search for \r\ncorroborating information cannot be \r\nconducted.  The veteran should be \r\ninformed of the possible consequences of \r\nhis failure to supply adequate \r\ninformation regarding his claimed \r\nstressors, namely that if they cannot be \r\ncorroborated, his claim may be denied.  \r\nThe veteran should be given a reasonable \r\namount of time in which to respond.\r\n\r\n2.  The National Personnel Records Center \r\nshould be contacted for any additional \r\npersonnel or service medical records \r\nregarding the veteran�s period of active \r\nduty while enlisted, from June 1963 to \r\nDecember 1971, including any additional \r\nDD-214 forms which may not be of record \r\nat this time.  Efforts to locate medical \r\nrecords pertaining to the veteran�s \r\nhospitalization in February and March of \r\n1969, while stationed in Vietnam, should \r\nbe made and documented in the claims \r\nfile.\r\n\r\n3.  After the above has been completed to \r\nthe extent possible, the RO must refer \r\nthe case to the U.S. Armed Services \r\nCenter for Research of Unit Records \r\n(USASCRUR) (formerly known as the United \r\nStates Army and Joint Services \r\nEnvironmental Support Group (ESG)) to \r\ndetermine whether there is any evidence \r\nthat the veteran engaged in combat with \r\nthe enemy during his service in Vietnam, \r\nand whether there is corroboration of the \r\nincidents described by the veteran in his \r\nstatements and hearing testimony.  The RO \r\nshould submit to USASCRUR a copy of this \r\nremand, a list of the veteran�s unit and \r\nlocations during his service in Vietnam, \r\nand all claimed stressors with any \r\navailable details, a copy of the \r\nveteran�s DD Form 214 and his service \r\npersonnel records, and all stressor \r\ninformation in the file.  The RO should \r\nalso refer to the statements provided by \r\nthe veteran, as well as his hearing \r\ntestimony for this information.\r\n\r\nThe USASCRUR is specifically asked \r\nto provide verification of the \r\nclaims that the veteran was engaged \r\nin combat with the enemy, that he \r\nwas involved with the transporting \r\nof deceased soldiers from the field \r\nto morgues, that he and his unit \r\nwere under enemy attack in December \r\n1968 at Moc Hoa, and casualties were \r\nincurred;  that he assisted in the \r\nattempted rescue of two Cobra \r\nhelicopter pilots on an airstrip at \r\nTam Ky Airport, in May 1969, \r\nresulting in the death of at least \r\none warrant officer who was on-board \r\nthe helicopter (reference should be \r\nmade to the statement of Mr. [redacted], \r\nwhich is of record);  that he was \r\npresent during a sniper attack on \r\nhis and an Army unit at Katum, in \r\nMarch 1969, in which a solider was \r\nkilled accidentally by a piece of \r\nheavy machinery;  that in Song Be, \r\nin March or April of 1969, the \r\nveteran�s unit came under rocket and \r\nsmall arms attack, resulting in \r\ncasualties;  as well as verification \r\nof any additional stressors the \r\nveteran may identify in connection \r\nwith further development of his \r\nclaim.  \r\n\r\nIn the event that this information \r\nis not available from USASCRUR, the \r\nRO must endeavor to obtain it from \r\nthe service department, VA records \r\nor from other official sources. \r\n\r\nIf the veteran can not provide a specific \r\ndate of a cited incident, unit records or \r\nlogs for the period of the veteran�s \r\nservice with that unit should be \r\nrequested.  If verification is not \r\navailable through USASCRUR, the RO should \r\ndetermine any source from which it might \r\nbe obtained and then try to obtain it.  \r\nIf the veteran has identified any \r\nindividuals who were also present, or \r\nwere injured or killed during the event, \r\nthe RO should try to obtain verification \r\nthat such individuals served with the \r\nveteran�s unit, or were in the area at \r\nthe time of the cited event.\r\n\r\n4.  The RO should also request that the \r\nveteran identify all treatment or \r\nevaluation he has received for panic \r\nattacks, an anxiety disorder, \r\nagoraphobia, PTSD, and any other \r\npsychiatric disorders, or substance abuse \r\nsince service, including the dates of \r\ntreatment, and the names and addresses of \r\nall physicians and facilities that have \r\ntreated him.  After obtaining appropriate \r\nauthorization, the RO should attempt to \r\nobtain the medical records that are not \r\nalready in the claims file.  Included \r\nshould be records of all periods of \r\ntreatment at the Vet Center of Midland, \r\nTexas, and records from treatment by Mr. \r\nVincent, certified counselor, of Abeline, \r\nTexas, and Dr. Pollard, of Dyess Air \r\nForce Base Hospital, Texas.  Any response \r\nto the RO�s requests should be included \r\nin the claims file.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.  Thereafter, if the RO determines that \r\nthe veteran engaged in combat with the \r\nenemy or if there is corroboration of any \r\nclaimed stressor, or there is no evidence \r\nto contradict the supporting evidence \r\nprovided by the statement of Mr. [redacted], \r\nthe veteran should be afforded a VA \r\npsychiatric examination by a board \r\ncertified psychiatrist, experienced in \r\nthe diagnosis and assessment of PTSD, to \r\ndetermine the correct diagnoses of all \r\npsychiatric disorders present.  The \r\nveteran should be informed upon \r\nnotification of the examination of the \r\npotential consequences of his failure to \r\nattend and cooperate with the \r\nexamination.  The entire claims folder \r\nand a copy of this remand must be made \r\navailable to the examiner prior to the \r\nexamination, the receipt of which must be \r\nacknowledged in the examination report.  \r\nThe examination should include \r\npsychological tests with PTSD subscales, \r\nthe results of which should be reviewed \r\nbefore a final psychiatric diagnosis is \r\ngiven.  The RO must specify for the \r\nexaminer any stressor(s) that it has \r\ndetermined are established by the record \r\nand the examiner must be instructed that \r\nonly those events may be considered for \r\nthe purpose of determining whether the \r\nveteran was exposed to a stressor in \r\nservice.  Specifically, the examiner must \r\ndetermine whether or not the veteran has \r\nPTSD.  In that regard the examiner�s \r\nattention is directed to the applicable \r\nportions of the DSM-III and DSM-IV.  If a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD is made, the examiner \r\nshould state which of the diagnostic \r\ncriteria of DSM-IV or DSM-III for PTSD \r\nhave and have not been satisfied and \r\nprovide a detailed description and \r\ndiscussion of the complaints and findings \r\nthat satisfy the criteria.  The examiner \r\nalso should specify: (1) whether \r\nstressor(s) found to be established by \r\nthe record by the RO were sufficient to \r\nproduce PTSD; and (2) whether there is a \r\nlink between the current symptomatology \r\nand one or more of the in- service \r\nstressors found to be established by the \r\nrecord by the RO and found to be \r\nsufficient to produce PTSD by the \r\nexaminers.  Further, the examiner should \r\nidentify any and all other psychiatric \r\ndisorders present, and indicate whether \r\nany is related to service.  The examiner \r\nshould be asked to distinguish, if \r\npossible, the symptomatology of any other \r\npsychiatric disorder identified, from \r\nPTSD, if identified.  A complete \r\nrationale for all opinions expressed by \r\nthe examiner must be provided.\r\n\r\n7.  The RO should then review the \r\nveteran�s claims file and ensure that the \r\nexamination report is responsive to the \r\nBoard�s request.  The claim should be \r\nreadjudicated with consideration of all \r\npertinent law, regulations, and Court \r\ndecisions.  If the veteran�s claim \r\nremains in a denied status, he and his \r\nrepresentative should be provided with a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case, which \r\nincludes any additional pertinent law and \r\nregulations and a full discussion of \r\naction taken on the veteran�s claim, \r\nconsistent with the Court�s instructions \r\nin Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 \r\n(1990).  The applicable response time \r\nshould be allowed.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the case should be returned to the Board, if in \r\norder.  The veteran need take no action unless otherwise \r\nnotified.\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment by the RO.  \r\nThe law requires that all claims that are remanded by the \r\nBoard of Veterans� Appeals or by the United States Court of \r\nVeterans Appeals for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee The Veterans� Benefits Improvements Act of 1994, Pub.

His DD \r\nForm 214 reflects that the veteran was awarded the National \r\nDefense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal (w/FMF Insignia \r\n& 1 Br Star), and a Vietnam Campaign Medal (w/Device 60-).  \r\nHis service personnel records reflect that he served at Camp \r\nHaines, Camp Evans, and the Republic of Vietnam.\r\n\r\nThe veteran filed his original claim for service connection \r\nfor PTSD in October 1989.  In a December 1990 rating action, \r\nthe RO denied service connection for PTSD and this appeal \r\nensued.  \r\n\r\nOf record are VA treatment and hospitalization records from \r\nVA Medical Center�s (VAMC�s) in Salisbury, North Carolina; \r\nDurham, North Carolina; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Salem, \r\nVirginia, and Hampton, Virginia, from November 1986 to \r\nDecember 1995.  As early as November 1986, the veteran was \r\ndiagnosed with PTSD.  The veteran�s treatment records reveal \r\ntreatment for various disabilities, including PTSD and \r\nalcohol abuse. \r\n\r\nA November 1990 VA examiner diagnosed the veteran with \r\nantisocial personality disorder with narcissistic features \r\nand alcohol dependence, mixed substance abuse, by history.  \r\nAfter an April 1994 VA examination, the examiner noted that \r\ngiven the veteran�s on-going alcohol abuse, it was not \r\npossible to determine whether the veteran met the criteria \r\nfor PTSD set forth in the DSM-IIIR.  After re-examination in \r\nOctober 1994, the examiner concluded that the veteran�s \r\ndiagnoses were alcohol dependence and anxiety disorder not \r\notherwise specified with depressive features.\r\n\r\nIn March 1994, the veteran submitted a statement to the RO \r\ndetailing his in service stressors.\r\n\r\nIn February 1997 the former Environmental Support Group (ESG) \r\n[now U. S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records \r\n(USASCRUR)] confirmed that members of the U. S. Naval Mobile \r\nConstruction Battalion ELEVEN (MCB-11) were exposed to motor \r\nand rocket attacks in areas including Camp Haines and Camp \r\nEvans during the veteran�s tour of duty.  The records also \r\nconfirmed that members of the Landing Zone (LZ) Nancy \r\nassisted in extinguishing ammunitions fires.  Additionally, \r\nthe history verified that passenger vehicles struck land \r\nmines in August and September 1969.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that further inquiry is needed, as the VA \r\nregulations pertaining to psychiatric disorders have changed \r\nduring the pendency of this appeal.  Effective November 7, \r\n1996, the VA has adopted the most recent Diagnostic and \r\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as the basis \r\nfor determining whether the veteran has PTSD for compensation \r\npurposes.  61 Fed. Reg. 52695 (Oct. 8, 1996).  Whereas the \r\npreviously applicable DSM-III-R criteria required that in \r\norder to establish a diagnosis of PTSD, the veteran must have \r\nundergone an experience which would have been of sufficient \r\ngravity to evoke the symptoms of PTSD in �almost anyone,� \r\nand the stressor had to be outside the range of usual human \r\nexperience, and be markedly distressing to almost anyone, a \r\ndiagnosis may now be established under DSM-IV when the \r\nveteran experiences, witnesses, or is confronted with an \r\nevent or events that involve actual or threatened death or \r\nserious injury, or a threat to his physical integrity or that \r\nof others, and his response involves intense fear, \r\nhelplessness, or horror.  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 \r\n(1997).  \r\n\r\nThe Board is cognizant of the veteran�s lengthy appeals \r\nprocess and does not desire to perpetuate this any longer \r\nthan necessary however, the Board believes that further \r\ndevelopment of the evidence is necessary, to include a \r\ndetermination of any stressors and an examination to clarify \r\nthe current psychiatric diagnosis and to determine whether \r\nthe veteran meets the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD under \r\nthe DSM-IV criteria.  Such remand will afford the veteran an \r\nadditional opportunity to provide information concerning his \r\nclaimed stressors.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, in a May 1997 statement, the veteran�s \r\nrepresentative requested a travel board hearing.  The veteran \r\nand his representative were advised by letter that he would \r\nhave to file a motion to request such hearing since he had \r\nnot requested such hearing within 90 days of the notice that \r\nhis claim was being forwarded to the Board in 1991.  A review \r\nof the record reflects that the veteran requested a hearing \r\non his substantive appeal in April 1991.  While he further \r\nindicated that he wanted a hearing before RO personnel, he \r\nwas sent a letter in April 1991 acknowledging his request \r\nbefore a traveling section of the Board.  He was told that, \r\nunless he notified the RO, his name would remain on the list \r\nof those who desire a hearing.  A subsequent letter scheduled \r\nhim for a hearing before RO personnel, but there was no \r\nindication that he asked to be taken off the travel board \r\nlist.  Since there is some confusion as to whether he does \r\nwant a hearing, this matter should be clarified.  \r\n\r\nThe case is therefore REMANDED to the RO for the following \r\nactions:\r\n\r\n1.  The veteran should be contacted and \r\nrequested to furnish a complete list of \r\nall medical personnel and facilities from \r\nwhich he has received treatment for PTSD.  \r\nAny such treatment records not already \r\nassociated with the veteran�s claims \r\nfolder should be obtained. Any available \r\nrecords so obtained should be associated \r\nwith the veteran�s claims folder. \r\n\r\n2.  The RO should review any information \r\nobtained and specify the stressors which \r\nare either consistent with the veteran�s \r\nservice or verified by the evidence.  \r\n\r\n3.  The RO should arrange to have the \r\nveteran examined by a VA psychiatrist in \r\norder to determine the diagnoses of all \r\npsychiatric disorders that are currently \r\npresent.  The examination report should \r\nreflect review by the examiner of all \r\npertinent information in the claims \r\nfolder, including the determination by \r\nthe RO of any accepted stressors.  If \r\nPTSD is diagnosed, the examiner should \r\nspecify (1) whether the in-service \r\nstressors were sufficient to produce PTSD \r\nunder DSM-III-R or DSM-IV; (2) whether \r\nthe remaining diagnostic criteria to \r\nsupport a diagnosis of PTSD under DSM-\r\nIII R or DSM-IV have been satisfied; and \r\n(3) whether there is a link between the \r\ncurrent symptomatology and the stressors \r\nin service whose existence has been \r\nestablished. The examination report \r\nshould include a complete rationale for \r\nall opinions expressed.  All necessary \r\nspecial studies or tests, including \r\npsychological testing and evaluation, \r\nshould be accomplished as part of this \r\nexamination.  The claims folder and a \r\ncopy of this remand must be made \r\navailable to the examiner for review \r\nprior to the examination.\r\n\r\n4.  The RO should then, review the record \r\nand ensure that all the above actions \r\nhave been completed.  When the RO is \r\nsatisfied that the record is complete and \r\nthe psychiatric examination is adequate \r\nfor rating purposes, the RO should \r\nproceed with an adjudication of the claim \r\non the merits.  \r\n\r\n5.  Thereafter, the RO should clarify \r\nwhether the veteran still desires a \r\ntravel board hearing.  If so, he should \r\nbe placed on the list for such hearing.  \r\n\r\nThereafter, if the benefit sought is not granted, a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case should be issued to the \r\nveteran and his representative and they should be provided an \r\nopportunity  to respond.  Subsequently, the claims folder \r\nshould be returned to the Board for further review, if \r\nnecessary.  By this action, the Board intimates no opinion \r\nlegal or factual, as to the ultimate disposition warranted as \r\nto this specific issue.\r\n\r\nWhile this case is in remand status, the veteran is free to \r\nsubmit additional evidence and argument on the question at \r\nissue.  See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet.App. 129, 141 (1992).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment by the RO.  \r\nThe law requires that all claims that are remanded by the \r\nBoard of Veterans� Appeals or by the United States Court of \r\nVeterans Appeals for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee The Veterans� Benefits Improvements Act of 1994, Pub.

C. Bruu, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active duty from February 1964 to September \r\n1967. \r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans� Appeals (Board) \r\nfrom an April 1995 rating decision of the Columbia, South \r\nCarolina, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) which denied service connection for PTSD.  The \r\ndenial was confirmed by rating decisions in July 1995 and \r\nOctober 1995.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nA claim for service connection for PTSD requires medical \r\nevidence establishing a clear diagnosis of the condition, \r\ncredible supporting evidence that the claimed inservice \r\nstressor(s) actually occurred, and a link, established by \r\nmedical evidence, between current symptomatology and service.  \r\nIf the claimed in-service stressor is related to combat, \r\nservice department evidence that the veteran engaged in \r\ncombat or that the veteran was awarded a combat citation will \r\nbe accepted, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as \r\nconclusive evidence of the claimed inservice stressor.  See \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) \r\n(1997).\r\n\r\nWhere, however, the VA determines that the veteran did not \r\nengage in combat, the veteran�s lay testimony, by itself, \r\nwill not be sufficient to establish the alleged stressor(s).  \r\nInstead, the record must contain service records or other \r\nindependent credible evidence to corroborate the veteran�s \r\ntestimony as to any alleged stressor.  Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 \r\nVet.App. 163, 166 (1996).  Those service records which are \r\navailable must support and not contradict the veteran�s lay \r\ntestimony concerning the non-combat stressors.  Doran v. \r\nBrown, 6 Vet.App. 283, 289 (1994).\r\n\r\nAlso, in Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet.App. 128, 138 (1997), the \r\nUnited States Court of Veterans Appeals emphasized the three \r\nelements required by section 3.304(f) to warrant a grant of \r\nservice connection for PTSD:  (1) a current, clear medical \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the \r\nclaimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) \r\nmedical evidence of a causal nexus between current \r\nsymptomatology and the specific claimed in-service stressor.  \r\nThe Court further held that, if the claimed stressor is not \r\ncombat related, a veteran's lay testimony regarding in-\r\nservice stressors is insufficient to establish the occurrence \r\nof the stressor and must be corroborated by \"credible \r\nsupporting evidence.\"  Id. at 142.\r\n\r\nThe veteran�s Air Force Form 7, Airman Military Record, \r\nreflects that the veteran�s specialty was aircraft propeller \r\nmechanic.  In September 1966, he was assigned to 377 CSGP Tan \r\nSon Nhut AB RVN (PACAF).  In November 1966, he was assigned \r\nto 460 FMS Tan Son Nhut AB RVN (PACAF) and to another unit at \r\nCam Ranh Bay AB.  In January 1967, he was assigned to 6483 \r\nCam Sq Cam Ranh Bay AB, and then to 483 Cam Sq.  His DD Form \r\n214, Armed Forces of the United States Report of Transfer or \r\nDischarge, reflects that his awards and decorations included \r\nthe National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service \r\nMedal, and the Air Force Good Conduct Medal.  It does not \r\nreflect award of the Purple Heart, the Combat Infantryman \r\nBadge, or other combat citation.\r\n\r\nService medical records are negative for any complaints or \r\nfindings of a disorder of a psychiatric nature.  We note \r\nthat, at his entrance examination in February 1964, the \r\nveteran reported a history of nervous trouble; however, at an \r\nexamination in August 1964, and upon subsequent examinations, \r\nno such report was made, and no psychiatric disorder was \r\nnoted at separation.\r\n\r\nThe veteran filed an original application for compensation or \r\npension in October 1994, seeking service connection for PTSD.  \r\n\r\nVA outpatient treatment records, dated in September 1994, \r\nindicate the veteran presented with complaint that he had \r\nbeen depressed lately.  Regarding past psychiatric history, \r\nhe reported that he had been depressed about five years \r\nbefore, treated at the Pee Dee Mental Health Clinic for five \r\nto six months, and took anti-depressants.  He reported that \r\nhe was currently working as a desk clerk at a motel and had \r\nhad 30 jobs in the past 30 years.  He denied suicidal thought \r\nand said that his sleep was poor due to a bad hip.  The \r\nimpression was dysthymic disorder.  In November 1994, he \r\nreported that he was still depressed; he was to follow up at \r\nthe Pee Dee Mental Health Clinic.  \r\n\r\nIn a February 1995 statement, the veteran listed his jobs \r\nfrom the time of his discharge from service in 1967 through \r\nthe present.  In an April 1995 statement, he listed ways he \r\nwas affected by his Vietnam experience, including failing at \r\ntwo marriages and other relationships.  The veteran�s ex-wife \r\nsubmitted a statement in April 1995, describing her \r\nobservation of the changes in the veteran between the time he \r\nleft for Vietnam and his return.  \r\n\r\nA report of the Pee Dee Mental Health Center indicates the \r\nveteran was seen on November 4, 1994, and failed to report \r\nfor followup on November 28, 1994.  A record of that facility \r\ndated November 4, 1994, indicates that the veteran had been \r\nseen there five years before.  He reported that he got \r\nbetter, stopped coming, did �O.K.� for about three years, \r\nbut had been sliding for the past two years.  He was on \r\nProzac, which he received at a VA facility.  He felt it was \r\nworking.  He was sleeping well, his appetite was good, he had \r\nmore energy, and he was employed.  He said he had never been \r\nself-destructive or abused drugs or alcohol, and had never \r\nhad flashbacks.  He was oriented in all spheres.  There was \r\nno evidence of thought disorder.  He was not currently \r\ndepressed.  He was told that he could be seen again at the \r\nfacility but that he would probably be better served by a \r\nlocal medical doctor as he did not appear to need \r\npsychotherapy.  He was return to the clinic in two weeks.  \r\nDiagnosis was depressive disorder and �R/O [i.e., rule out] \r\ndepression.�  \r\n\r\nVA outpatient treatment records dated in August 1995 indicate \r\nthe veteran presented with request for a mental health clinic \r\nreferral, for depression and anxiety, with questionable \r\nrelationship to service in Vietnam.  He reported that he had \r\nno suicidal ideation, no energy, a loss of desire and \r\ninterest, and some sleeping difficulty.  Objective findings \r\nincluded clear and concise speech, normal thought content, \r\nand no depression.  Diagnosis was depression/anxiety by \r\nhistory.  It was recommended that he follow up at his county \r\nmental health department.  A record of October 1995 indicates \r\nthe veteran spoke of seeing body bags and holes in planes in \r\nTan Son Nhut.  Assessment was dysthymia versus PTSD.  \r\n\r\nIn a statement received by the RO in October 1995, the \r\nveteran stated he was not working and had not worked since \r\nFebruary 1995.  He referred to an excerpt from the 1994 \r\nedition of �Federal Benefits for Veterans and Dependents� \r\nand stated that he had some of the symptoms listed there for \r\nPTSD.  He claimed he had intrusive recollections or memories, \r\nanxiety, sudden reactions after exposure to traumatic \r\nconditions, and readjustment difficulties affecting \r\nfunctioning in family or work.  \r\n\r\nIn a statement submitted in December 1995, the veteran \r\ndescribed his stressors.  He stated that he was in Vietnam \r\nfrom September 1966 to September 1967.  He first went to Tan \r\nSon Nhut.  He was an aircraft mechanic.  He stated that the \r\nbase was attacked at night, that he went to the hangar to \r\nescape, and that he saw body bags in the morning.  He did not \r\nhave a gun.  He felt scared and helpless and thought of home.  \r\nHe next went to Cam Ranh Bay.  On the way back from the local \r\ntown one time he heard what sounded like �a lot of guns \r\ngoing off all over the place.�  He looked for a ditch to \r\nhide in but could not find one.  The experience, he said, was \r\nvery shocking.  He next went to Pleiku.  As this was closer \r\nto the demilitarized zone, he and the others there were \r\nconstantly watching for the Viet Cong.  They had south \r\nVietnamese working on the base and some were good and some \r\nwere bad.  This, he said, was nerve-racking.  Thereafter, he \r\nwent back to Cam Ranh Bay and, after one month, went home.  \r\nHe also described his experiences when he got home.\r\n\r\nVA outpatient treatment record, dated in January 1996, \r\nindicates the veteran reported intrusive daily thoughts, no \r\nnightmares, and severe anxiety periods.  The assessment was \r\nPTSD versus dysthymic disorder.  A record of August 1996 \r\nindicates the veteran reported that he had periods where he \r\ndid not want to be around anybody, could not cope with \r\nanything, had exaggerated startle reaction, and was \r\nhypervigilant but not suicidal.  He reported that he was \r\n�hit 3 nights by enemy at Tan.�  Objective findings \r\nincluded cognitive impairment of short term and immediate \r\nmemory, reduced attention span and concentration; he was \r\nfound to be inflexible and inefficient, and his behavior and \r\nemotions were unreliable and unpredictable.  Assessment was \r\nchronic PTSD with severe anxiety symptoms.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe veteran testified at a personal hearing before a hearing \r\nofficer at the RO in September 1996.  With respect to events \r\nin Vietnam, he stated that he was an aircraft/propeller \r\nmechanic and was always stationed out of a base itself.  He \r\nwas stationed at Ton Son Nhut from September 1966 to January \r\n1967.  The base was attacked three nights in a row and he saw \r\nbody bags.  One of the Viet Cong that got killed was a barber \r\nwho had cut his hair a week before.  He had temporary duty \r\nfor two weeks in Cam Ranh Bay.  The base there was not \r\nattacked.  He also mentioned other periods of temporary duty, \r\nincluding one involving an airplane with mechanical problems; \r\nthey had to fly in, fix it, and get back out.  He described \r\nthe effects that he believed these experiences had on him.\r\n\r\nA VA outpatient treatment record, dated in November 1996, \r\nindicates the veteran returned with continuing problems of \r\nPTSD and depression.  His recent hearing at the RO, and \r\nnotification of continued denial of service connection for \r\nPTSD, were noted.  Assessment was chronic PTSD and severe \r\nanxiety symptoms.  He was to return to the clinic, for one \r\nmore visit, in six months, at which time, if he had no \r\n�documentation,� he would have to be discharged.  It was \r\nnoted that the veteran planned to pursue further \r\ndocumentation of his stressors from the National Archives.  A \r\nrecord of May 1997 reflects additional follow up for PTSD.  \r\nIt was noted that the veteran had not worked since 1992 and \r\nwas currently unemployable on a full-time/regular basis.  \r\n\r\nCopies of military records, pertaining to combat operations \r\nat Tan Son Nhut Air Base in December 1966, were received from \r\nthe veteran in June and September 1997.  The records reflect \r\nthat the base received a combined mortar and sapper \r\npenetration attack between 0105 and 0315 hours on 4 December \r\n1966, and that search-and-destroy and counter-action \r\ncontinued until 1340 hours on 5 December 1966.  There were \r\nthree U.S. Air Force members killed in action, three members \r\nof ARVN, and 28 members of the enemy forces.  The records do \r\nnot reflect any direct involvement of the veteran�s assigned \r\nunit.\r\n\r\nAdditional multiple statements in support of the claim were \r\nsubmitted by the veteran in June, July, August, and December \r\n1997, and in April 1998.\r\n\r\nVA outpatient treatment records of July and September 1997 \r\nindicate the veteran underwent a Minnesota Multi-phasic \r\nPersonality Inventory (MMPI).  Assessment was severe PTSD and \r\ngeneralized anxiety/depression.  In a record of November 1997 \r\nand a report of the treating physician of November 1997, the \r\nphysician stated that the veteran was apparently suffering \r\nfrom PTSD or anxiety disorder or depression.  The MMPI had \r\nshown depression and anxiety, rather severe.  The physician \r\nreported that the veteran had �documented stressors.�\r\n\r\nA VA examination was conducted in November 1997.  The \r\nexaminer reported that he had reviewed the veteran�s claims \r\nfile.  The veteran described problems being around people and \r\na problematic work history.  With respect to stressors in \r\nservice, he reported attacks on his bases.  He reported that \r\nhe was in a hangar at the time.  The examiner reported that \r\nthe veteran did not give vivid details of facing horrific \r\nevents, but did describe being frightened.  The impression \r\nwas generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks.  The \r\nexaminer stated that, while the veteran was clearly \r\nmoderately to severely disabled due to a psychiatric \r\ndisorder, with a Global Assessment of Functioning score of \r\nabout 50, the examiner was not convinced that the veteran had \r\nreally undergone a life-threatening stressor while in \r\nVietnam, and his symptoms seemed more to revolve around \r\ngeneralized anxiety and goraphobia [sic] than intrusive \r\nthoughts from Vietnam.  \r\n\r\nThus, it appears from the record that the veteran has \r\nsubmitted credible supporting evidence that an event which he \r\nhas associated with his claimed inservice stressor, i.e., an \r\nattack on Tan Son Nhut Air Base, actually occurred.  See \r\nCohen, at 142.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Board observes that the medical record contains \r\nmultiple diagnoses of the veteran�s psychiatric disorder.  He \r\nhas been diagnosed as suffering from dysthymia, depression, \r\nanxiety, and panic attacks, in addition to being diagnosed \r\nwith PTSD.  Under these circumstances, it is appropriate that \r\nthe veteran be scheduled for another VA psychiatric \r\nexamination to determine his current diagnosis.  It is also \r\nimportant that the examiner address the etiological \r\nrelationship of any diagnosed neuropsychiatric disorder, if \r\nany, to the veteran's service.  More specifically, \r\ndevelopment is necessary with respect to the required element \r\nof linkage between current PTSD symptomatology and the \r\ncorroborated in-service stressors.  The question as to \r\nwhether the corroboration of the veteran�s base having been \r\nsubject to attack, which resulted in casualties and equipment \r\ndamage and losses (the occurrence of which have been \r\nestablished by the record) contributed to the veteran�s \r\ncurrent symptoms of PTSD must be addressed.  See Cohen, at \r\n138.\r\n\r\nThis remand is mandated by precedential caselaw of the Court \r\nof Veterans Appeals, which has held, as discussed above, \r\nthat, under 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), eligibility for service \r\nconnection requires, among other things, �[a] current, clear \r\nmedical diagnosis of PTSD . . . .�  Cohen, 10 Vet.App. at \r\n138 (1997); see also Suozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet.App. 307, 309 \r\n(1997).  Moreover, the Court has noted that the regulatory \r\nrequirement of a �clear diagnosis� of PTSD means an \r\n�unequivocal� one, see Cohen, 10 Vet.App. at 139.  In \r\nevaluating diagnoses, �the adjudicators may reject a claim \r\nonly upon finding a preponderance of the evidence against a \r\nPTSD diagnosis . . . .�  Id., at 153 (Nebeker, C.J., \r\nconcurring).  Since the evidence of record at this time \r\ncontains conflicting psychiatricdiagnoses, including PTSD, it \r\nis our opinion that further development of this claim is \r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe Board recognizes that, during the pendency of the \r\nveteran�s appeal, VA issued a final rule, which took effect \r\non November 7, 1996, amending that portion of the Schedule \r\nfor Rating Disabilities pertaining to mental disorders.  61 \r\nFed. Reg. 52,695 (Oct. 8, 1996) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. \r\npart 4).  In part, that final rule replaced 38 C.F.R. � 4.130 \r\nwith a new section that adopted the Diagnostic and \r\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-\r\nIV), as the basis for the nomenclature of the rating schedule \r\nfor mental disorders, in place of the earlier version of that \r\ntext, DSM-III.  As the Court noted in its Cohen decision, \r\nsupra, a significant change from DSM-III to DSM-IV is that \r\nthe diagnostic criteria for a PTSD stressor (that is, the \r\nrequirements for determining the sufficiency of a claimed \r\nstressor) �are no longer based solely on usual experience \r\nand response but are individualized (geared to the specific \r\nindividual�s actual experience and response).�  Cohen, 10 \r\nVet.App. at 141.\r\n\r\nAs a general matter, where there has been a change in \r\npertinent regulations while a claim is pending, a claimant is \r\nentitled to have his or her claim adjudicated under whichever \r\nversion would be more favorable, the old or the new.  See \r\nKarnas v. Derwinski, 1 Vet.App. 308 (1991).  The issue in \r\nthis case is two-pronged -- the sufficiency of the veteran�s \r\nclaimed stressor(s), and whether he has current adequate \r\nsymptomatology to support a �clear diagnosis� of PTSD.  The \r\nnew rule made no change in the specific PTSD regulation, \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), and the Court has held that the DSM-IV \r\ndiagnostic criteria for PTSD symptomatology do not raise an \r\nissue with regard to the Karnas principle.  Cohen, 10 \r\nVet.App. at 139.  However, we mention this change to guide \r\nthe RO in readjudicating this case on remand, particularly \r\nbecause a comment by the VA examiner in November 1997, to the \r\neffect that it was doubtful the veteran had experienced a \r\nlife-threatening stressor in Vietnam, may have been made in \r\nlight of the previous, non-individualized diagnostic criteria \r\nof DSM-IV.\r\n\r\nVA has a duty to assist a veteran in developing facts \r\npertinent to a well-grounded claim.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a) \r\n(West 1991); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.103, 3.159 (1997).  That duty \r\nincludes obtaining medical records and medical examinations \r\nwhere indicated by the facts and circumstances of an \r\nindividual case.  See Murphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet.App. 78 \r\n(1990); Littke v. Derwinski, 1 Vet.App. 90 (1990).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, further appellate consideration will be deferred \r\nand the case is REMANDED to the RO for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should contact the veteran \r\nand request that he provide the names \r\nand addresses of all medical care \r\nproviders who have treated him for his \r\nclaimed PTSD.  The RO should request \r\nthat the veteran furnish signed \r\nauthorizations for release to VA of \r\nprivate medical records in connection \r\nwith each non-VA source identified.  The \r\nRO should attempt to obtain any such \r\nprivate treatment records, not already \r\non file, which may exist and incorporate \r\nthem into the claims folder.  The RO \r\nshould also obtain any records of VA \r\ntreatment after November 1997.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  The RO should then schedule the \r\nveteran for a VA psychiatric examination \r\nin order to determine his current \r\nneuropsychiatric diagnosis, if any.  It \r\nis critical that the claims folder, \r\nalong with any additional evidence \r\nrequested above, be provided to the \r\nexaminer for review.  The examination \r\nreport should reflect review of \r\npertinent material in the claims folder \r\nand include the complete rationale for \r\nall opinions expressed.  Any necessary \r\nspecial studies or tests, to include \r\npsychological testing, should be \r\naccomplished.  In determining whether \r\nthe veteran experienced an inservice \r\nstressor that may be related to any \r\ndiagnosed disorder, the examiner is \r\nhereby notified that only the verified \r\nhistory detailed in the military records \r\npertaining to combat operations at Tan \r\nSon Nhut Air Base in December 1966, may \r\nbe relied upon.  Based on his/her review \r\nof the case, the examiner should express \r\nan opinion, if possible, as to the \r\nmedical probability that any currently \r\ndemonstrated disorder is etiologically \r\nrelated to the veteran�s service.\r\n\r\n3.  After the development requested \r\nabove has been completed, the RO should \r\nagain review the entire record.  If the \r\ndetermination remains unfavorable to the \r\nveteran, the RO should furnish him and \r\nhis representative with a supplemental \r\nstatement of the case, in accordance \r\nwith 38 U.S.C.A. � 7105 (West 1991).  \r\nThereafter, the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative should be given the \r\nopportunity to respond.  The case should \r\nthen be returned to the Board for \r\nfurther appellate consideration, if \r\notherwise in order, following \r\nappropriate appellate procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this REMAND the Board intimates no opinion, either legal \r\nor factual, as to the ultimate determination warranted in \r\nthis case.  The purpose of this REMAND is to further develop \r\nthe record.  No action is required by the veteran until he \r\nreceives further notice.\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment by the RO.  \r\nThe law requires that all claims that are remanded by the \r\nBoard of Veterans� Appeals or by the United States Court of \r\nVeterans Appeals for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee The Veterans� Benefits Improvements Act of 1994, Pub.

Wasser Chambers, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from December 1970 to July \r\n1972.\r\n\r\nThis case comes to the Board of Veterans� Appeals (Board) \r\nfrom an October 1995 RO decision which denied service \r\nconnection for PTSD.  An RO hearing was requested and \r\nscheduled, but the veteran canceled his hearing request, as \r\nindicated by the RO hearing officer in an October 1997 \r\ndeferred rating decision.\r\n\r\nIn a July 1998 decision, the RO granted entitlement to non-\r\nservice-connected disability pension benefits, and such issue \r\nis not on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends he has PTSD, which is attributable to \r\ntraumatic experiences while serving in the Air Force in \r\nGreece during the Vietnam era.  Regardless of whether or not \r\nhis claim is well grounded, the VA has an obligation to help \r\nhim complete his application for benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n5103(a) (West 1991); Robinette v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 69 \r\n(1995). \r\n\r\nIn order to establish service connection for PTSD, there must \r\nbe medical evidence establishing a clear diagnosis of the \r\ncondition, credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-\r\nservice stressor actually occurred and a link, established by \r\nmedical evidence, between current symptomatology and the \r\nclaimed in-service stressor.  If the claimed stressor is \r\nrelated to combat, service department evidence that the \r\nveteran engaged in combat or that the veteran was awarded the \r\nPurple Heart, Combat Infantryman Badge, or similar combat \r\ncitation will be accepted, in the absence of evidence to the \r\ncontrary, as conclusive evidence of the claimed in-service \r\nstressor.  38 C.F.R.� 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty in the Air Force from \r\nDecember 1970 to July 1972.  A review of his DD Form 214 \r\nshows that his primary military occupational specialty was \r\nthat of a Morse system operator, and does not indicate either \r\nthat he was stationed in Vietnam or that he engaged in \r\ncombat.  His service personnel records are not associated \r\nwith the file.  The Board finds that such records should be \r\nobtained. \r\n\r\nA July 1995 VA psychological outpatient treatment record \r\nshows that the veteran reported that during active Air Force \r\nservice, he was stationed in Greece as a communications \r\nspecialist and was responsible for sending out the \r\ncoordinates for sites which were to be bombed in Vietnam.  \r\nThe diagnostic assessment was deferred; rule out PTSD.  At a \r\nFebruary 1996 VA psychological evaluation, the examiner noted \r\nthat although the veteran reported some symptoms consistent \r\nwith PTSD, he did not have PTSD.  The diagnostic assessment \r\nwas dysthymia. \r\n\r\nPrivate medical records from Soldiers� Home in Massachusetts, \r\nChelsea, dated from 1993 to 1997 primarily relate to \r\ntreatment for orthopedic complaints, but some of the records \r\nindicate diagnoses of PTSD.  Such records do not indicate the \r\nstressors on which such diagnoses were based.\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD has been denied by the RO partly \r\non the grounds that there is no clear diagnosis of PTSD or \r\ncredible evidence of an in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.304(f).  Since the veteran did not engage in combat, his \r\nstatements and testimony are inadequate to prove the \r\noccurrence of a stressor in service; such a stressor must be \r\nestablished by official service records or other credible \r\nsupporting evidence.  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet.App. 128 (1997); \r\nDoran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283 (1994).  The RO should obtain \r\na statement from the veteran as to his claimed in-service \r\nstressors, and should then attempt to corroborate the \r\nstatements of stressors with the U.S. Armed Services Center \r\nfor Research of Unit Records (USASCRUR).  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that a VA examination should be provided to \r\nascertain whether there is a clear diagnosis of PTSD based on \r\nany verified in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f); \r\nCohen, supra.  The medical evidence indicates that the \r\nveteran has been receiving episodic private psychiatric \r\ntreatment in recent years; ongoing treatment records should \r\nbe obtained. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the case is REMANDED to the RO for the following \r\ndevelopment:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should obtain, from the \r\nNational Personnel Records Center (NPRC), \r\nservice personnel records of the veteran \r\nconcerning his Air Force active duty.  \r\n\r\n2.  The RO should then ask the veteran to \r\nprovide a detailed written account \r\n(including dates, locations, names of \r\nother persons involved, unit \r\ndesignations, etc.) of the alleged \r\nservice stressors for PTSD.  The RO \r\nshould forward the veteran�s statement \r\n(along with copies of his service \r\npersonnel records and any other relevant \r\nevidence) to the USASCRUR, and request \r\nthat organization investigate and attempt \r\nto verify the alleged stressors.  \r\n\r\n3.  The RO should have the veteran \r\nidentify (names, addresses, dates) all \r\nsources of VA or non-VA treatment or \r\nexamination for any psychiatric disorder \r\nsince 1997.  The RO should then contact \r\nthe sources and obtain copies of the \r\nrelated medical records, which are not \r\nalready on file.\r\n\r\n4.  Following completion of the above \r\ndevelopment, the veteran should be \r\nafforded a VA psychiatric examination \r\nconcerning claimed PTSD.  The claims \r\nfolder must be provided to and reviewed \r\nby the examiner.  PTSD should be \r\ndiagnosed or ruled out in accordance with \r\nthe standards of DSM-IV.  If PTSD is \r\ndiagnosed, the doctor should clearly \r\nidentify the claimed events which are \r\nconsidered stressors supporting the \r\ndiagnosis, and the doctor should fully \r\nexplain why the stressors are considered \r\nsufficient under the standards of DSM-IV.\r\n\r\n5.  Thereafter, the RO should review the \r\nclaim for service connection for PTSD.  \r\nIf the claim remains denied, then a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case should \r\nbe issued to the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative, and they should be given \r\nan opportunity to respond.  Then, the \r\ncase should be returned to the Board for \r\nfurther appellate review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tL. W.

To the \r\nextent indicated below, those actions have been completed and \r\nthis case is properly before the Board for review upon the \r\nmerits.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the veteran was originally represented \r\nby The American Legion.  In September 1997, the veteran \r\ninformed the RO that he no longer wished to be represented by \r\nThe American Legion.  In December 1997, the veteran provided \r\nthe RO with a new designation of service organization as his \r\nrepresentative stating that he desires the Veterans of the \r\nVietnam War Inc. to be his representative.  He further stated \r\nthat if that was not possible that he wanted the Vietnam Era \r\nVeterans Association to represent him.  Again, if that was \r\nnot possible, he stated that he wanted the Veterans of \r\nForeign Wars to serve as his representative.  The veteran \r\ncontacted the RO at a later undisclosed dated and stated the \r\nVeterans of Foreign Wars was unable to serve as his \r\nrepresentative.  The record is unclear but it appears that he \r\nmay have reiterated his desire to have the Veterans of the \r\nVietnam War Inc. serve as his representative.  Due to the \r\nconfusion as to the representative of record, the Board \r\ninformed the veteran in October 1998, that only one \r\norganization could be designated and that clarification was \r\nneeded.  The Board noted that if the veteran did not respond, \r\nit would assume that the veteran no longer sought \r\nrepresentation.  The notice to the veteran was returned as \r\nnot deliverable and the Board has not heard from the veteran.  \r\nAccordingly, since there is no clear designation of a \r\nrepresentative, the Board will proceed with the appeal \r\nwithout referral to a representative.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTIONS OF APPELLANT ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that the RO erred in not granting the \r\nbenefit sought.  The veteran contend that his post-traumatic \r\nstress disorder (PTSD) originated in service.  He maintains \r\nthat his Vietnam experiences caused his PTSD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECISION OF THE BOARD\r\n\r\nThe Board, in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 7104 (West 1991 & Supp. 1998), has reviewed and considered \r\nall of the evidence and material of record in the veteran's \r\nclaims file.  Based on its review of the relevant evidence in \r\nthis matter, and for the following reasons and bases, it is \r\nthe decision of the Board that\r\nthe preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for \r\nservice connection for PTSD. \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  All relevant evidence necessary for an equitable \r\ndisposition of this claim has been obtained by the RO, to the \r\nextent possible.\r\n\r\n2.  The veteran's accounts of stressors in service are \r\nuncorroborated by objective evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in service. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1154, \r\n5107 (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nInitially, the Board finds that the veteran�s claim is well \r\ngrounded in accordance with 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107 (West 1991) in \r\nthat his claim is plausible based upon the clinical evidence \r\nof record and the evidentiary assertions provided by the \r\nveteran that are within the competence of lay party.  Murphy \r\nv. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 78 (1990);  King v. Brown, 5 Vet. \r\nApp. 19 (1993).  Once it has been determined that a claim is \r\nwell grounded, VA has a statutory duty to assist the veteran \r\nin the development of evidence pertinent to that claim.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5107.\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for disability \r\nresulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted \r\nin line of duty, or for aggravation of a pre-existing injury \r\nsuffered or disease contracted in line of duty.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (1998).  Regulations also provide \r\nthat service connection may be granted for any disease \r\ndiagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including \r\nthat pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was \r\nincurred in service. 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).  \r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Veterans Appeals (Court) has held \r\nthat in order to establish service connection, there must be \r\nevidence of both a service-connected disease or injury and a \r\npresent disability which is attributable to such disease or \r\ninjury.  Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143 (1992).  \r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\nestablishing a clear diagnosis of the condition, credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor \r\nactually occurred, and a link between current symptomatology \r\nand the claimed in-service stressor.  If the claimed stressor \r\nis related to combat, service department evidence that the \r\nveteran was awarded the Purple Heart, Combat Infantryman \r\nBadge, or similar combat citation will be accepted, in the \r\nabsence of evidence to the contrary, as conclusive evidence \r\nof the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nIn the case of Zarycki v. Brown, the Court set forth the \r\nframework for establishing the presence of a recognizable \r\nstressor, which is the essential prerequisite to support the \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD.  The Court analysis divides into two major \r\ncomponents:  the first component involves the evidence \r\nrequired to demonstrate the existence of an alleged stressful \r\nevent; the second involves a determination as to whether the \r\nstressful event is of the quality required to support the \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first component of the Court analysis, \r\nunder 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b), 38 C.F.R. � 3.304, and the \r\napplicable VA�s Manual 21-1 provisions, the evidence \r\nnecessary to establish the occurrence of a recognizable \r\nstressor during service to support a claim of entitlement to \r\nservice connection for PTSD will vary depending on whether or \r\nnot the veteran �engaged in combat with the enemy.�  See \r\nHayes v. Brown, 5 Vet.App. 60 (1993).  Whether or not a \r\nveteran �engaged in combat with the enemy� must be \r\ndetermined through recognized military citations or other \r\nservice department evidence.  In other words, the claimant�s \r\nassertions that he �engaged in combat with the enemy� are \r\nnot sufficient, by themselves, to establish this fact.  The \r\nrecord must first contain recognized military citations or \r\nother supportive evidence to establish that he �engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy.�  If the determination with respect \r\nto this step is affirmative, then (and only then), a second \r\nstep requires that the veteran�s lay testimony regarding \r\nclaimed stressors must be accepted as conclusive as to their \r\nactual occurrence and no further development or corroborative \r\nevidence will be required, provided that the veteran�s \r\ntestimony is found to be �satisfactory,� e.g., credible, \r\nand �consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or \r\nhardships of such service.�  Zarycki at 98.\r\n\r\nThe Court recently refined it�s reasoning in Fossie v. West, \r\nNo. 96-1695 (U.S. Vet. App. Oct. 30, 1998), when it held that \r\nif the veteran did not receive any of the recognized military \r\ncitations which indicate combat pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f) and no evidence of combat has been presented by \r\nthe veteran, the Board may properly conclude that the veteran \r\ndid not engage in combat and the Board is not required, \r\npursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b), to accept his lay \r\ntestimony as conclusive evidence of the presence of in-\r\nservice stressors.\r\n\r\nA review of the veteran�s service medical records are \r\nnegative or treatment or complaints of PTSD.  During the \r\nveteran�s May 1969 discharge examination, he was \r\npsychiatrically evaluated as normal.  The veteran reenlisted \r\nin June 1974 with no psychiatric complaints.  During the \r\nveteran�s June 1975 discharge examination, he was again \r\npsychiatrically evaluated as normal.\r\n\r\nThe veteran�s VA DD Form 214 reveals that the veteran served \r\nas a general warehouseman in service.  He served in Vietnam \r\nand was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam \r\nService Medal W/3*, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal \r\n(1960), Presidential Unit Citation, Expert Badge (M-14), and \r\nGood Conduct Medal.  \r\n\r\nRecords from the Wyoming State Hospital in August 1983 \r\nreflect diagnoses of alcohol dependence, amphetamine or \r\nsimilarly acting sympathomimetic dependence, cocaine abuse, \r\nand antisocial personality.  \r\n\r\nOf record is a November 1990 psychological examination \r\nperformed while the veteran was incarcerated.  He reported \r\nthat he was in Vietnam for eighteen months and was wounded in \r\nthe leg with shrapnel.  He stated that he received three \r\npresidential citations.  He refused to further elaborate on \r\nhis Vietnam experiences.    After examination, the examiner \r\nconcluded that the veteran seemed to be suffering from PTSD \r\nassociated with Vietnam.  He further, noted that the veteran \r\nwas a violent individual who was essentially anti-social.\r\n\r\nThe veteran filed his original claim for service connection \r\nfor �bad nerves� in March 1994.  In a May 1994 statement to \r\nthe RO, the veteran stated that he saw bodies blown apart and \r\nbody bags.  He was unclear as to the specific circumstances \r\nsurrounding his stressful experiences.\r\n\r\nIn August 1994, the veteran underwent VA examination for \r\nPTSD.  He reported that he had been in the Marines from 1966 \r\nto 1969.  He reenlisted in 1974 and was discharged eleven \r\nmonths later due to an inability to adapt.  He stated that he \r\nspent eighteen months in Vietnam.  He was a warehouseman but \r\nstated that he spent most of his time as a combat engineer \r\nand sniper.  He stated that he provided support to other \r\ngroups and participated in road sweeps looking for mines.  He \r\nstated that he was a sniper on the lines at night but he was \r\nunable to elaborate on his responsibilities.  He reported \r\nthat his unit underwent daily rocket attacks and artillery \r\nattacks near Dong Ha.  He reported that he lost many partners \r\nbut could not remember any specific details.  The examiner \r\nnoted that the veteran was evasive about his social history \r\nafter service but noted that the veteran had spent all but \r\nthree or four years since 1976 in various penal institutions.\r\n\r\nThe veteran initially denied mental health treatment but \r\nacknowledged that he took  illegally acquired Valium to \r\nalleviate his sleep problems and nightmares.  He stated that \r\nhis most prominent symptom of PTSD was a recurrent nightmare \r\nwhich he described as a �death dream.�  He stated that \r\nsometimes he would go months without the dream and at other \r\ntimes it would occur as often as three times a week.  He \r\nreported that loud noises scared him and that he occasionally \r\nbecame anxious without realizing why.  He reported that he \r\nwas presently incarcerated at the Wyoming penitentiary and \r\nthat his day was fairly regimented.\r\n\r\nAfter examination, the examiner noted that the veteran \r\npresented with a long history of antisocial activities and \r\nmultiple incarcerations.  The examiner opined that the \r\nveteran�s problems were due to his antisocial personality \r\nwith aggressive features.  He noted a probable significant \r\nhistory of alcohol abuse but noted that it had been curtailed \r\nin prison.  The examiner commented that he could not put much \r\nstock in the veteran�s history, either his military \r\nexperiences or his current symptomatology.  The examiner \r\nnoted that he felt that the veteran was likely to falsify \r\ninformation or stretch the truth if he felt that it was to \r\nhis best advantage.  The examiner further, explained that \r\neven if the rocket attack stressors were confirmed, that the \r\nveteran�s stressors were not at the level of acuity usually \r\nassociated with PTSD.  Because he could not confirm the \r\nsymptomatology of PTSD, the examiner did not provide a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn a September 1994 rating decision, the RO denied \r\nentitlement to service connection for PTSD.  The veteran \r\nfiled his notice of disagreement (NOD) in May 1995 and \r\nperfected his appeal in June 1995.  Incorporated his NOD, was \r\na statement of stressful events that the veteran experienced \r\nin Vietnam.  He recalled an occasion where a school friend \r\nwas killed.  He described occasions where snipers fired upon \r\nthe chow hall.  He stated that due to his experiences in \r\nVietnam, he was nervous and sensitive to loud noises.\r\n\r\nDuring the veteran�s December 1995 RO hearing, he testified \r\nthat he was attached to the 3rd Engineer Battalion, Charlie \r\nCompany in Da Nang and Dong Ha.  He stated that his unit was \r\nshelled every day in Dong Ha.  He described events such as \r\nsnipers firing upon the chow hall.  He reported that a school \r\nfriend was killed in Vietnam.  He stated that while his \r\nmilitary occupational specialty (MOS) was a warehouseman, he \r\nactually performed many duties such as truck driver and \r\nammunitions supply.  He described nightmares and stated that \r\nhe woke up sweating.  He stated that he was presently unable \r\nto be in groups of people.  He had been prescribed Valium for \r\nhis general anxiety and nightmares.  He stated that a prison \r\npsychologist had diagnosed him with PTSD.  He stated that he \r\nwas not receiving any current treatment for his PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn May 1996, the Hearing Officer denied entitlement to \r\nservice connection for PTSD and the case was forwarded to the \r\nBoard for adjudication upon the merits.  In August 1997, the \r\nBoard remanded the case to the RO for further development, \r\nincluding verification of the veteran�s alleged Vietnam \r\nstressors.\r\n\r\nIn September 1997, the veteran reiterated his stressful \r\nevents in a statement to the RO.  He recalled an occasion \r\nwhere he instructed two soldiers to seek cover in a trench \r\nonly to be buried alive minutes later.  He stated that one of \r\nthe soldiers was severely injured.\r\n\r\nAlso submitted in support of his claims, are private medical \r\nrecords from July 1983 to October 1997 which reveal treatment \r\nfor various disabilities.  After a psychological examination \r\nin August 1983, no psychiatric diagnoses were determined.  In \r\nAugust 1994, the veteran complained of anxiety.  In December \r\n1994, the examiner noted that the veteran had a diagnosis of \r\nPTSD.  In December 1995, the veteran was provided Valium for \r\nPTSD.  In May 1996, the veteran complained of anxiety attacks \r\nand nightmares.\r\n\r\nIn September 1997 the Environmental Support Group (ESG), now \r\nthe U.S. Armed Service Center for Research of Unit Records \r\n(USACRUR) provided command chronologies for the 3rd Engineer \r\nBattalion from February 1967 to May 1967.  The records did \r\nnot verify any of the veteran�s claimed stressors.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, the veteran maintains that during service he \r\nexperienced stressful events in Vietnam that led to PTSD.  He \r\nasserts that at present his anxiety and nightmares are \r\nrelated to service.  A review of the evidence of record \r\nindicates that the veteran was initially trained as a general \r\nwarehouseman.  He asserted that while assigned to Vietnam, he \r\nserved as a sniper.  He was awarded the Republic of Vietnam \r\nCampaign Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, and National \r\nDefense Service Medal.  He was also awarded the Presidential \r\nUnit Citation, Expert Badge, and Good Conduct Medal.  These \r\nmedals were awarded for achievement and not for valor.  The \r\nevidence does not indicate that he was awarded the Purple \r\nHeart or other such combat citation, and the Board finds that \r\nthere is no other supportive evidence of record that the \r\nveteran engaged in combat.  Under such circumstances, the \r\nBoard must make the determination if the veteran had a \r\nrecognizable stressor. See Zarycki, 6 Vet. App. 91.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the Board has noted that the veteran has made \r\na number of statements regarding his service in Vietnam, and \r\nthe stressful incidents therein.  In Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 \r\nVet. App. 163, 166 (1996), the Court held that \"credible \r\nsupporting evidence\" required by 38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (f) means \r\nthat the veteran's testimony, by itself, cannot as a matter \r\nof law, establish the occurrence of a non-combat stressor. \r\nInstead, the record must contain evidence which corroborates \r\nthe veteran's testimony as to the occurrence of the claimed \r\nstressors.  Thus, the Board will now consider each of the \r\nincidents as reported by the veteran and determine if the \r\nrequired credible supporting evidence is present.\r\n\r\nDuring a November 1990 private psychological examination, the \r\nveteran reported that he was wounded in the leg with shrapnel \r\nand was awarded three presidential citations.  He refused to \r\nfurther elaborate on his Vietnam experiences.\r\n\r\nIn a May 1994 statement, the veteran reported seeing bodies \r\nblown apart and body bags.  He was examined for compensation \r\npurposes by the VA in August 1994.  On psychiatric \r\nexamination, he indicated that he spent most of his time as a \r\nsniper and combat engineer.  He was unable to elaborate on \r\nhis sniper responsibilities.  He stated that he participated \r\nin mine sweeps.  He also reported that his unit experienced \r\ndaily rocket attacks.  He reported that he had lost many \r\npartners but was unable to relate any specific details.\r\n\r\nHe submitted a statement in May 1995 along with his NOD \r\nwherein he described an occasion when he instructed two \r\nrecruits to take cover in a trench only to have them buried \r\nalive moments later.  One soldier was badly injured.  He \r\ndescribed occasions when the chow hall was fired upon by \r\nenemy snipers.  He also reported that one of his school \r\nfriends joined him and was shortly thereafter killed.  He \r\nreported that his friend�s name was John Killen.\r\n\r\nThe veteran presented testimony in December 1995.  At the RO \r\nhearing, he stated that he was a warehouseman but served in \r\nmany capacities such as truck driver and ammunitions supply \r\nman.  When pressed for specifics as to dates, places, or \r\nnames, the veteran did not provide such specifics.\r\n\r\nThe veteran provided a statement in September 1997, at which \r\ntime he reiterated his story of the two young recruits being \r\nburied alive.  He described his experiences in fox holes and \r\ntrenches during the monsoon season.  He stated that his unit \r\nwas shelled upon about three or four times a day and that \r\nsnipers regularly fired upon the chow hall.  He recalled his \r\nfriend dying and described an occasion when he was supposed \r\nto ride in a supply plane that was full of leaking body bags.\r\n\r\nThe veteran has reported a number of alleged stressful \r\nincidents.  However, on repeated occasions, he was given \r\nopportunities to provide either corroborating evidence or \r\nspecific information with regard to the stressors. At his \r\nDecember 1995 hearing, he failed to give any specifics, \r\ndespite questioning by the hearing officer and his \r\nrepresentative.  As previously noted, the veteran's \r\ntestimony, by itself, cannot establish the occurrence of a \r\nstressor when the veteran is not shown to have been in \r\ncombat. See Dizoglio, 9 Vet. App. 163.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Board finds that the veteran was assigned to \r\nVietnam, and was exposed to danger.  However, there is no \r\ncorroboration in the available records that the veteran was \r\nexposed to a recognizable stressor.  Having concluded that \r\nthe required credible supporting evidence of a stressor is \r\nnot present, the Board finds that service connection for PTSD \r\nis not appropriate.  In the absence of verified stressors in \r\nservice, it would serve no useful appellate purpose to remand \r\nthe case for a medical examination, pursuant to the August \r\n1997 Board remand, to consider the relationship between \r\nunverified stressors and any post service symptomatology.\r\n\r\nIn reaching this determination, the Board has considered the \r\nstatements made in November 1990 by a private examiner \r\nconcluding that PTSD caused by service was present.  This \r\ndetermination was made based on the history given by the \r\nveteran. However, unenhanced reports of a history provided by \r\na medical examiner do not constitute probative evidence.  See \r\nLeShore v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 406 (1995). Hence, such \r\nrecitation of the veteran's stressors, in the absence of any \r\nobjective verification, cannot serve as the basis of a grant \r\nof service connection for PTSD. See Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. \r\nApp. 389 (1996).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tV. L.

McCormack, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active military service from January 1965 to \r\nDecember 1968.  \r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\nfrom a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Boise Regional \r\nOffice (RO) July 1996 rating decision which denied service \r\nconnection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe veteran failed to report for a hearing at the Boise RO \r\nscheduled in December 1996 without any indication of good \r\ncause for his failure to appear, and he has not otherwise \r\nexpressed a desire to reschedule that hearing.  Thus, the \r\nBoard will proceed as though he has withdrawn his request for \r\nsuch hearing.  38 C.F.R. � 20.704(d).\r\n\r\nThe veteran also failed to report for VA medical examinations \r\nscheduled for December 1997 and March 1998.\r\n\r\nThis case was previously before the Board in August 1998 at \r\nwhich time it was remanded for further development of the \r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nThe veteran then failed to report for VA psychiatric \r\nexamination scheduled for December 1998.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The evidence of record does not include a clear medical \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD or establish a causal nexus between any \r\nPTSD and a specific stressor or other verifiable event in \r\nservice.\r\n\r\n2.  The veteran was scheduled for VA examinations in December \r\n1997, March 1998 and December 1998 in connection with his \r\nclaim for service connection for PTSD.  The veteran failed to \r\nreport for these examinations and he did not provide adequate \r\nreason or good cause for failing to undergo such \r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe veteran is not shown to have PTSD that was incurred in or \r\naggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107 \r\n(West 1991 & Supp. 1998); 38 C.F.R. 3.303, 3.304 (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThe veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD is well \r\ngrounded pursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a), as it is \r\nplausible under the circumstances of this case.  \r\nSpecifically, a May 1996 private psychological evaluation \r\nreport shows that he was diagnosed as having PTSD, and the \r\nveteran's account of his in-service stressors are sufficient \r\nto render his claim well grounded.  Murphy v. Derwinski, 1 \r\nVet. App. 78, 81 (1990); King v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 19 \r\n(1993).\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disease or injury \r\nincurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 1110, (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (1998).  Service \r\nconnection may also be granted for a disease diagnosed after \r\ndischarge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to \r\nservice, establishes that the disease was incurred in \r\nservice.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d) (1998).\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), service connection \r\nfor PTSD requires: medical evidence establishing a clear \r\ndiagnosis of the condition; credible supporting evidence that \r\nthe claimed in-service stressors actually occurred; and \r\nmedical evidence of a link between current symptoms and the \r\nclaimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1998); \r\nCohen v. Brown, 10 Vet App 128, 138 (1997); Moreau v. Brown, \r\n9 Vet. App. 389, 394-95 (1996).  A \"clear diagnosis\" of \r\nPTSD is, at a minimum, an unequivocal one.  Cohen, 10 Vet. \r\nApp. 128, at 139.\r\n\r\nWith respect to a diagnosis of PTSD, VA follows the criteria \r\nset out in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \r\nDisorders (DSM- IV) as the basis for determining whether a \r\nperson has PTSD for compensation purposes.  See 61 Fed. Reg. \r\n52695 (Oct. 8, 1996).  Under DSM-IV, a person must have been \r\nexposed to a traumatic event in which the person experienced, \r\nwitnessed, or was confronted with, an event or events that \r\ninvolve actual or threatened death or serious injury of \r\nothers, and his response must have involved intense fear, \r\nhelplessness, or horror.  The question of whether the event \r\ninvolved actual or threatened death or serious injury or \r\nthreat to physical integrity per DSM-IV is subjective.  The \r\nmatter of the sufficiency of the stressor is now a question \r\nof medicine, not law.  See Cohen, 10 Vet. App. at 128.\r\n\r\nIn Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91 (1993), the U.S. Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims (hereinafter, the Court, known as \r\nthe U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals prior to March 1, 1999) \r\nheld that the presence of a recognizable stressor is the \r\nessential prerequisite to support the diagnosis of PTSD.  \r\nWhether a veteran engaged in combat with the enemy must be \r\ndetermined through recognized military citations or other \r\nservice department evidence.  In other words, the claimant's \r\nassertions that he engaged in combat with the enemy are not \r\nsufficient, by themselves, to establish this fact.  The \r\nrecord must first contain recognized military citations or \r\nother supportive evidence to corroborate the veteran's \r\nassertions that he engaged in combat with the enemy.  \r\nZarycki, 7 Vet. App. a 98.\r\n\r\nWhere the veteran engaged in combat and the claimed stressors \r\nare related to such combat, the veteran's lay testimony must \r\nbe accepted as conclusive as to their actual occurrence and \r\nno further development for corroborative evidence will be \r\nrequired.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f); West v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. \r\n70, 76 (1994).  Where the veteran did not engage in combat \r\nwith the enemy, his uncorroborated testimony is insufficient \r\nto establish the alleged noncombat stressor.  Dizoglio v. \r\nBrown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 166 (1996); West, 7 Vet. App. at 76.  \r\nCredible supporting evidence is required.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f); Dizoglio, 9 Vet. App. at 166.\r\n\r\nThe Court has stated that \"[j]ust because a physician or \r\nother health professional accepted the appellant's \r\ndescription of his Vietnam experiences as credible and \r\ndiagnosed the appellant as suffering from post-traumatic \r\nstress disorder does not mean the [Board is] required to \r\ngrant service connection for post-traumatic stress \r\ndisorder.\"  Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614, 618 \r\n(1992).  Simply stated, in general, the Board is not required \r\nto accept an appellant's uncorroborated account of his \r\nVietnam experiences.  See Swann v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 229, \r\n233 (1993); Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 192 (1991).\r\n\r\nThe veteran's service personnel records show that he served \r\nas a Hospital Corpsman aboard the U.S.S. REPOSE from December \r\n1967 until his release from active service in December 1968.  \r\nThey further show that he was awarded the Vietnam Service \r\nMedal among other decorations.  However, there is nothing in \r\nthese records which demonstrate that the veteran served on \r\ncombat duty during his period of active service.\r\n\r\nHis service medical records do not show any reports, findings \r\nor a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder during his period of \r\nactive service.  His January 1965 service entrance \r\nexamination reflects that psychiatric evaluation revealed \r\nnormal findings.  An August 1968 record shows that he \r\nreported that he had had trouble sleeping the previous few \r\nnights.  The examiner indicated that the veteran had had \r\ninsomnia the previous few weeks, and that he did not exhibit \r\nany apparent personal or marital problems.  On December 1968 \r\nseparation examination, psychiatric evaluation of the veteran \r\ndid not reveal any abnormalities.  In the accompanying Report \r\nof Medical History, the veteran indicated that he had not had \r\nfrequent trouble sleeping, frequent or terrifying nightmares, \r\ndepression or excessive worry or nervous trouble of any sort.\r\n\r\nIn support of his claim, the veteran submitted a \r\npsychological evaluation report, dated in May 1996, from \r\nDarlene J. Golas, L.C.S.W. (Licensed Clinical Social Worker), \r\nfrom Hamilton, Montana.  D. J. Golas reported that the \r\nveteran had entered into readjustment counseling in January \r\n1992 and then again in September 1994.  PTSD and alcohol \r\ndependency were diagnosed.  Several stressful incidents were \r\nreported as having occurred during the veteran's period of \r\nactive service, including the stress he experienced while \r\nworking triage aboard the U.S.S. REPOSE.  An example of such \r\nstress included an incident when the refrigeration system \r\nbroke down and the rotting smell of forty bodies in bags \r\ninfused the entire ship.  The veteran also reported that his \r\nlife had been threatened by a psychiatric patient whom he had \r\nbeen treating.  He also reported a general feeling of being \r\ntrapped aboard the ship, and that the ship was overrun with \r\ncockroaches.  Another incident involved holding a telephone \r\nfor a soldier who had both of his arms blown off.  Two other \r\nincidents involved witnessing a jet fighter crash and seeing \r\na Vietnamese fisherman being cut in half by a Coast Guard \r\ncutter.  The veteran was diagnosed as having PTSD.\r\n\r\nBy a May 1996 deferred rating decision, the RO found that the \r\nveteran had not provided sufficient details regarding \r\n\"stressors\" to allow independent verification.  \r\nConsequently, the RO sent him correspondence later that month \r\nrequesting additional details regarding the stressors, and \r\nany treatment he may have had for PTSD.\r\n\r\nAs reported earlier, by a July 1996 rating decision, the RO \r\ndenied the veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD.  \r\nIn so doing, the RO indicated that the evidence of record did \r\nnot establish that the veteran had had a stressful experience \r\nsufficient to cause PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn January 1997, the veteran submitted a lay statement \r\nwherein he described his in-service stressors.  These \r\nstressors included his experiences working triage during \r\nservice, and the incident involving the forty body bags.  The \r\nveteran's account of his in-service stressors were \r\nessentially he same as those already identified by D. J. \r\nGolas.  The veteran also reported that he had been out of \r\nwork for several years and enclosed a VA Form 21-4142 for the \r\nRO to request his work history from the Social Security \r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nA request for records concerning the veteran was sent to the \r\nSocial Security Administration in April 1997.  The RO \r\nsubsequently received the veteran's social security \r\napplication and a copy of a June 1995 orthopedic examination.  \r\nHowever, these records do not show any pertinent findings \r\nregarding the veteran's psychiatric condition.\r\n\r\nBy a January 1998 supplemental statement of the case, the RO \r\nfound that there was no confirmed diagnosis of PTSD, and \r\nnoted that the veteran had failed to appear for his December \r\n1997 VA examination without apparent good cause.  Moreover, \r\nthe RO indicated that no specific stressful event had been \r\nidentified as a causative factor, or verified from military \r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nAs indicated earlier, in August 1998, the Board remanded this \r\nmatter for further development of the evidence to include a \r\nVA psychiatric examination.  The RO was also requested to \r\nclarify whether a licensed clinical social worker was \r\nqualified to render a valid, clinical diagnosis of an \r\nacquired psychiatric disorder under DSM-IV, to include PTSD; \r\nand to verify the veteran's reported service-related \r\nstressors.  Additionally, the Board noted that the veteran \r\nhad failed to report for two VA examinations, and advised him \r\nthat, should he again fail to report for a scheduled \r\nexamination, his claim might be denied on the grounds of \r\nabandonment pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 3.158.\r\n\r\nBy August 1998 telephonic contact, an employee of the Bureau \r\nof Occupational Licenses for the State of Idaho, advised the \r\nRO that licensed clinical social workers were considered \r\nqualified to make a valid, clinical diagnosis of an acquired \r\npsychiatric disorder under DSM-IV to include PTSD.  It was \r\nnoted that the accompanying Social Work Laws and Rules, \r\nBureau of Occupational Licenses, State of Idaho indicated, in \r\nSection 201.02a, that \" clinical social work encompasses \r\ninterventions directed to interpersonal interactions, \r\nintrapsychic dynamics, and life support and management \r\nissues.  It includes but is not limited to individual, \r\ncouples, family and group psychotherapy.  Clinical social \r\nwork consist of assessment, treatment and evaluation.\"\r\n\r\nA September 1998 letter from the Department of the Navy, \r\nNaval Historical Center, with attached command history of the \r\nU.S.S. REPOSE (AH 16) for the years 1967 to 1968, shows that \r\nthe REPOSE operated as a floating hospital throughout \r\nSoutheast Asia during the period in question.  It further \r\nshows that a hospital corpsman on such a ship would \r\npresumably have been called on to work with doctors and \r\nnurses to care for the sick and wounded.\r\n\r\nAs reported earlier, the veteran failed to report for a VA \r\npsychiatric examination scheduled for December 1998.\r\n\r\nBy a January 1999 supplemental statement of the case, the RO \r\ndenied the veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD.  \r\nIt noted that the veteran had failed to report for scheduled \r\nVA examinations on three occasions.  The RO also indicated \r\nthat the record did not include a clear diagnosis of PTSD \r\npursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), and that the veteran's \r\nclaim was considered abandoned pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 3.158.\r\n\r\nAfter careful review of the entire record, the Board agrees \r\nwith the RO and finds that the veteran's claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD must be denied.  Specifically, the Board \r\nfinds that there is no clear medical diagnosis of PTSD or \r\ncompetent evidence of record which establishes a causal nexus \r\nbetween any claimed PTSD and a specific stressor or other \r\nverifiable event in service.  While the veteran's service \r\npersonnel records show that he was awarded the Vietnam \r\nService Medal, they do not establish that he served on combat \r\nduty during his period of active service.  As such, his \r\ncontentions regarding his stressors, by themselves, are not \r\nenough to establish their occurrence.  Instead, the record \r\nmust contain evidence which corroborates the veteran's \r\ncontentions as to the occurrence of the claimed stressors.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A.  1154(b); 38 C.F.R. 3.304(d); West, 7 Vet. App. \r\nat 70.  Thus, it is necessary to address the matter of \r\nwhether there is sufficient corroboration of the claimed \r\nstressors in this case.\r\n\r\nThe letter from the Department of the Navy, Naval Historical \r\nCenter, with attached command history of the U.S.S. Repose \r\n(AH 16), does tend to support the veteran's descriptions of \r\nhis stressors, as it shows that the REPOSE operated as a \r\nfloating hospital throughout Southeast Asia, and that a \r\nhospital corpsman on such a ship would presumably have worked \r\nwith doctors and nurses to care for the sick and wounded.  \r\nHowever, the letter and command history do not specifically \r\nverify or corroborate the veteran's alleged stressors (e.g., \r\nrotting smell from the body bags, threats to his life from a \r\npsychiatric patient and incidents wherein he held a telephone \r\nfor a soldier who had both of his arms blown off, witnessing \r\na jet fighter crash and seeing a Vietnamese fisherman cut in \r\nhalf by a Coast Guard cutter).  In addition, despite the RO's \r\nefforts to assist the veteran, he failed to provide the \r\nrequested information to facilitate further inquiries.\r\n\r\nThe evidentiary record does show that D. J. Golas, L.C.S.W., \r\ndiagnosed the veteran as having PTSD, and that licensed \r\nclinical social workers are qualified to make a valid, \r\nclinical diagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disorder under \r\nDSM-IV to include PTSD.  However, the Board again emphasizes \r\nthat it is not bound to accept either the veteran's \r\nuncorroborated account of his stressful experience or the \r\nopinion of VA or private health professionals who, relying on \r\nthe history related by the veteran, have diagnosed the \r\nveteran as having PTSD.  See Swann, 5 Vet. App. 229, at 233.  \r\nAs such, while D. J. Golas has apparently accepted the \r\nveteran's accounts of his experiences during service, VA is \r\nnot required to do the same, charged as it is with the duty \r\nto assess the credibility and weight to be given to the \r\nevidence.  Wood, 1 Vet. App. at 190.  Except for the \r\nveteran's uncorroborated statements, there is no evidence, \r\nwhatsoever, that the veteran experienced any of his alleged \r\nstressors.  As such, the Board finds that the preponderance \r\nof the evidence is against the veteran's claim.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, the Board finds that the veteran is not shown \r\nto have a clear diagnosis of PTSD due to a verified in-\r\nservice stressor.  The medical evidence in this regard simply \r\ndoes not serve to establish that he had experienced a \r\nstressor on which a diagnosis of PTSD can be based.  As such, \r\nthere is no credible evidence which supports the veteran's \r\nallegations or meets the requirements of 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nIn reaching its decision, the Board has considered the matter \r\nof resolution of the benefit of the doubt in the veteran's \r\nfavor.  However, it is noted that application of the benefit-\r\nof-the-doubt rule is only appropriate when the evidence is \r\nevenly balanced or in relative equipoise.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 \r\n(1990).  Such is decidedly not the case in this instance \r\nwhere, as noted above, the evidence does not demonstrate that \r\nthere is a clear medical diagnosis of PTSD or establish a \r\ncausal nexus between any claimed PTSD and a specific stressor \r\nor other verifiable event in service.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tGary L.

Zapata, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from April 1966 to March \r\n1970.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from a September 1995 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nLouisville, Kentucky.  This matter was previously remanded by \r\nthe Board for further development in July 1997.  That \r\ndevelopment has been completed and the case is now ready for \r\nappellate review.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nA clear diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder has not \r\nbeen demonstrated. \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by active service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107(a) (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, \r\n3.304 (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary matter, the Board finds that the veteran's \r\nis \"well-grounded\" within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.A. 5107 \r\n(West 1991).  That is, the Board finds that the veteran has \r\npresented a claim which is not implausible when his \r\ncontentions and the evidence of the record are viewed in the \r\nlight most favorable to that claim. The Board is also \r\nsatisfied that all relevant facts have been properly and \r\nsufficiently developed.\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for disability \r\nresulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted \r\nin the line of duty, or for aggravation of a pre-existing \r\ninjury or disease.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110 (West 1991); \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (1998).  Service connection may be granted \r\nfor any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the \r\nevidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes \r\nthat the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.303(d).  With respect to post-traumatic stress disorder, \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1998) specifically applies to the \r\nadjudication of claims for service connection and provides, \r\nin pertinent part, that service connection for post-traumatic \r\nstress disorder requires medical evidence establishing a \r\nclear diagnosis of the condition, credible supporting \r\nevidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually \r\noccurred, and a link, established by medical evidence, \r\nbetween current symptomatology and the claimed in-service \r\nstressor.  If the claimed stressor is related to combat, \r\nservice department evidence that the veteran engaged in \r\ncombat or that the veteran was awarded the Purple Heart, \r\nCombat Infantryman Badge, or similar combat citation will be \r\naccepted, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as \r\nconclusive evidence of the claimed inservice stressor.  Id.  \r\nUnder the governing statutory and regulatory provisions, if \r\nthe claimed stressor is not related to the veteran's \r\nparticipation in combat, his lay testimony, by itself, will \r\nnot be enough to establish the occurrence of the alleged \r\nstressor and must be supported by credible supporting \r\nevidence.  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 147 (1997); \r\nDoran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, 289 (1994); Zarycki v. \r\nBrown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 (1993).  \r\n\r\nEven when it is determined that the veteran engaged in combat \r\nwith the enemy and that the claimed stressor is related to \r\nsuch combat, the veteran's lay testimony regarding the \r\nstressor must be accepted as conclusive as to its actual \r\noccurrence only when the veteran's testimony is found to be \r\nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f); see Cohen, 10 Vet. App. 128, 146.\r\n\r\nDuring the pendency of this appeal, VA revised the schedule \r\nfor evaluating mental disorders.  The revision became \r\neffective November 7, 1996.  61 Fed. Reg. 52,695 (1996).  On \r\nand after that date, all diagnoses of mental disorders for VA \r\npurposes must conform to the 4th edition of the Diagnostic \r\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).  61 Fed. \r\nReg. 52,700 (1996) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. � 4.125).  DSM-\r\nIV has revised the definition of what constitutes a stressor \r\nfor purposes of diagnosing post-traumatic stress disorder.  \r\nThe primary effect of this change is that the criteria have \r\nchanged from an objective \"would evoke...in almost anyone\" \r\nstandard in assessing whether a stressor is sufficient to \r\ntrigger post-traumatic stress disorder, to a subjective \r\nstandard; the criteria now require exposure to a traumatic \r\nevent and a response involving intense fear, helplessness, or \r\nhorror.  A more susceptible individual might have post-\r\ntraumatic stress disorder based on exposure to a stressor \r\nthat would not necessarily have the same effect on \"almost \r\nanyone.\"  The sufficiency of a stressor is, accordingly, now \r\na clinical determination for the examining mental health \r\nprofessional.  Cohen, 10 Vet. App. 128.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the first element of a post-traumatic stress \r\ndisorder claim, a clear diagnosis of the condition, the \r\nmedical evidence includes a September 1989 Agent Orange \r\nexamination report containing a diagnosis of severe anxiety \r\nreaction.  A report of VA hospitalization during May and June \r\n1993 includes a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder \r\nwhen the veteran was admitted for substance abuse and was \r\nnoted to complain of PTSD symptoms.  In a summary report of \r\nVA hospitalization in May and June 1993, a provisional \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD was reported.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the report from an August 1995 VA compensation \r\nand pension examination of the veteran, the examining \r\nphysician opined that the veteran's primary diagnosis was not \r\npost-traumatic stress disorder, but instead an organic \r\nsyndrome secondary to chronic substance abuse and a gunshot \r\nwound to the head.  \r\n\r\nIn a September 1996 VA examination report specific for \r\nrespiratory disabilities, the examiner made no findings with \r\nrespect to psychiatric disability, but carried a diagnosis of \r\npost-traumatic stress disorder.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the totality of the medical evidence of \r\nrecord, the Board must conclude that the veteran has failed \r\nto meet the first requirement for service connection for \r\npost-traumatic stress disorder spelled out in 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f).  The August 1995 VA examination specifically for \r\npost-traumatic stress disorder ruled out such a diagnosis.  \r\nThe August 1995 VA examination diagnosis was based on review \r\nof the medical record, including earlier VA hospitalization \r\nand provisional diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder.  \r\nAs such, it is deemed to be more probative.  A subsequent \r\nSeptember 1996 VA examination report listing a diagnosis of \r\npost-traumatic stress disorder pertained to a respiratory \r\nexamination of the veteran and no psychiatric findings, other \r\nthan the listing of a psychiatric diagnosis, were made.  The \r\nveteran's service medical records are negative for evidence \r\nof treatment of the veteran for complaints of nervousness or \r\nemotional trauma.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the second element necessary for a well-\r\ngrounded claim for service connection for post-traumatic \r\nstress disorder, the veteran's Form DD-214 reveals that his \r\nmilitary occupational specialty was that of a disbursing \r\nclerk.  The Form DD-214 does not reveal the award of any \r\ndecorations specific for combat.  The veteran contends that \r\ninservice stressors included coming under multiple mortar, \r\nrocket attacks, and mortar fire while attached to 1st HQ \r\nCompany of the 1st Marine Division in Vietnam.  In addition, \r\nthe veteran stated that he saw many dead bodies, was part of \r\na group of men that were ambushed resulting in two \r\ncasualties, saw troops land in mine fields, witnessed a woman \r\nbeing thrown from a helicopter, was part of a unit which had \r\nnapalm dumped upon it, witnessed the burning of a Vietnamese \r\nnational, and shot a Vietnamese woman after she tried to stab \r\nhim. \r\n\r\nFollowing the Board's July 1997 remand, the RO attempted to \r\nobtain service records corroborating the veteran's stressors.  \r\nThose records reveal that the veteran did participate in \r\noperations against insurgent communist forces (Viet Cong) \r\nduring the period August 1969 to March 1970.  However, no \r\nfurther corroborating information of the stressors alleged by \r\nthe veteran were forwarded.  \r\n\r\nEven if assuming that the veteran did \"engage in combat,\" \r\nand the applicability of the evidentiary presumption of \r\n38 C.F.R. � 1154(b), with regard to the alleged stressors, \r\nthere still must be a clear diagnosis of PTSD.  Inasmuch as \r\nthe preponderance of the evidence, as discussed above, is \r\nagainst a finding of a current credible diagnosis of PTSD, \r\nhis claim for service connection for PTSD does not meet one \r\nof the requirements of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  Accordingly, \r\nthe veteran has failed to establish entitlement to service \r\nconnection for post-traumatic stress disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress \r\ndisorder is denied.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tU.

L. Wasser, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from September 1967 to \r\nApril 1969, and from May 1969 to March 1977.\r\n\r\nThis matter came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) from a September 1995 RO decision which, in pertinent \r\npart, denied the veteran's claim for service connection for \r\nCAD secondary to service-connected PTSD.  The Board denied \r\nthe claim in an August 1997 decision.  The veteran then \r\nappealed to the United States Court of Veterans Appeals \r\n(which has recently been renamed the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims) (Court).  In an August 1998 \r\njoint motion to the Court, the parties (the veteran and the \r\nVA Secretary) requested that the August  1997 Board decision \r\nbe vacated and remanded as to the issue of secondary service \r\nconnection for CAD.  In an August 1998 order, the Court \r\ngranted the joint motion.  The case was returned to the \r\nBoard.  In February 1999, the Board requested a medical \r\nexpert opinion.  That opinion was obtained in March 1999.  In \r\nthat same month, the veteran representative was provided a \r\ncopy of the medical opinion and was given an opportunity to \r\nsubmit additional evidence and argument; and the \r\nrepresentative thereafter submitted additional written \r\nargument.\r\n\r\n[The 1997 Board decision also denied other claims, but an \r\nappeal as to these issues was dismissed by the 1998 joint \r\nmotion and Court order.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe veteran's service-connected PTSD did not cause or \r\npermanently worsen his CAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe veteran's CAD is not proximately due to or the result of \r\nservice-connected PTSD.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131 (West \r\n1991); 38 C.F.R. � 3.310 (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  Factual Background\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from September 1967 to \r\nApril 1969, and from May 1969 to March 1977.  Service medical \r\nrecords are negative for cardiovascular disorders.  A \r\nFebruary 1977 separation examination report reflects that the \r\nveteran's cardiovascular system was within normal limits, and \r\nhis blood pressure was 120/82\r\n\r\nAt a May 1977 VA examination, the veteran's cardiovascular \r\nsystem was listed as normal, and his blood pressure was \r\n110/72.\r\n\r\nA February 1989 VA hospital discharge summary reflects that \r\nthe veteran presented in January 1989 with complaints of \r\nchest pain and was diagnosed with an acute myocardial \r\ninfarction.\r\n\r\nA March 1989 VA hospital discharge summary indicates that the \r\nveteran was diagnosed with unstable angina after he presented \r\nwith complaints of chest pain.  A March 1989 stress and \r\nredistribution thallium test revealed a small area of \r\ninferoapical ischemia and a small to moderate area of high \r\nseptal ischemia.\r\n\r\nA March 1989 VA medical center transfer summary indicates \r\nthat the veteran underwent cardiac catheterization.  The \r\nfindings included diffuse CAD, a normal hemodynamic at rest, \r\nmild inferior wall hypokinesis and normal ejection fraction, \r\nand mitral valve prolapse with trace mitral regurgitation.  \r\nThe examiner noted a 20 pack per year history of tobacco \r\nabuse and a family history which was strongly positive for \r\nCAD, with the veteran's father dying at age 56 and his sister \r\ndying at age 47, both of myocardial infarction.  The primary \r\ndiagnosis was CAD, and the secondary diagnosis was \r\nhypercholesterolemia.\r\n\r\nA March 1989 VA discharge summary indicates diagnoses of \r\nangina and mitral valve prolapse.\r\n\r\nA July 1989 VA hospital discharge summary indicates that the \r\nveteran was admitted for cardiac catheterization after a June \r\n1989 non-Q wave myocardial infarction without complications.  \r\nThe examiner noted that the veteran had no history of \r\nhypertension.  The discharge diagnoses, in pertinent part, \r\nincluded unstable angina, two-vessel CAD, and renal \r\ninsufficiency.\r\n\r\nA December 1989 VA discharge summary indicates that the \r\nveteran had a history of atherosclerotic coronary vascular \r\ndisease and complained of chest pain; the diagnosis was \r\nunstable angina.\r\n\r\nA March 1991 VA stress and redistribution thallium test was \r\nperformed and revealed an abnormal baseline with no \r\nadditional sinus tachycardia shift at inadequate peak heart \r\nrate, with no infarction.  A small amount of posterolateral \r\nischemia was seen.\r\n\r\nA history of CAD is noted in other medical records from the \r\n1990s, including a January 1993 VA examination.\r\n\r\nIn May 1995, the veteran complained of increased chest pain, \r\nnon-radiating, substernal, lasting 10 to 15 minutes, twice a \r\nweek, which was relieved with medication.  The veteran noted \r\na relationship between his substernal pressure and his PTSD \r\nsessions.  He also noted the same chest pain when walking.  \r\nThe examiner's impression was increased angina associated \r\nwith increased stress.  \r\n\r\nLater in May 1995, the veteran complained of a high \r\ntemperature, sweating, and aching all over.  The examiner's \r\nassessment was, in part, CAD, PTSD, and orthostatic blood \r\npressure.\r\n\r\nIn August 1995, the veteran submitted claims for service \r\nconnection for PTSD and for a heart disorder secondary to \r\nPTSD.\r\n\r\nAn August 1995 VA cardiology outpatient treatment record \r\nshows that the veteran's blood pressure was 90 systolic over \r\n86 diastolic, and that he complained of low grade chest pain \r\ntwice weekly, as well as shortness of breath.  The examiner \r\nindicated a diagnostic impression of stable CAD and \r\nquestionable lung disease.\r\n\r\nIn August 1995 the veteran was treated for symptoms of PTSD.  \r\nA diagnosis of chronic PTSD was indicated.\r\n\r\nIn a September 1995 rating decision, service connection was \r\nestablished for PTSD, with a 10 percent disability \r\nevaluation.  Service connection was denied for CAD secondary \r\nto PTSD, including aggravation of heart disease by PTSD.  The \r\nveteran appealed the denial of secondary service connection \r\nfor CAD. \r\n\r\nPrivate medical records from D. E. Ridley, M.D. dated in \r\nNovember 1995, indicate that in November 1995, the veteran \r\nwas diagnosed, in pertinent part, with an acute myocardial \r\ninfarction, syncope, atrial fibrillation, and habitual \r\ntobacco use.\r\n\r\nIn a May 1996 rating decision, the RO assigned a higher \r\nrating of 30 percent for the veteran's service-connected \r\nPTSD.\r\n\r\nIn June 1996, the RO received an undated handwritten letter \r\nfrom a VA staff physician (of the cardiology section of a VA \r\nmedical center (VAMC)) who related that the veteran was \r\ntotally disabled from heart disease, and his history of \r\ntreatment for heart disease since 1989 was summarized.  It \r\nwas noted that PTSD, from the veteran's Vietnam experience, \r\nwas diagnosed in 1995.  The doctor commented that it was well \r\nknown that stress was a critical element in the development \r\nof atherosclerotic heart disease, and that in her opinion a \r\nsignificant part of the veteran's cardiac condition was \r\nservice-connected.  [The veteran recently submitted a \r\ntypewritten copy of this letter, dated in August 1987.]\r\n\r\nIn October 1996, the veteran submitted a copy of the rating \r\ndecision of another veteran (a former prisoner of war) who \r\nwas granted secondary service connection for hypertension due \r\nto PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn February 1999, the Board requested a medical expert \r\nopinion from the VA's Veterans Health Administration as to \r\nthe issue of service connection for CAD claimed as secondary \r\nto PTSD.  In response, a March 1999 memorandum was received \r\nfrom the Chief of Cardiology of a VAMC.  The VA cardiologist \r\nstated that he reviewed the veteran's claims file, and said \r\n(referring to the now-vacated Board decision), \"I concur \r\nwith the conclusion reached by the Board of Veterans Appeals \r\nthat this veteran's coronary artery disease is not related to \r\nPTSD.\"  He added the following:\r\n\r\nThe veteran has multiple risk factors for \r\ncoronary artery disease including very \r\nstrong family history (both parents and a \r\nsister with history of myocardial \r\ninfarction, hypercholesterolemia and \r\nsmoking.  The veteran had an inferior \r\nwall myocardial infarction at age 45 in \r\n1989, 6 years before there was any \r\nmention of PTSD in the medical record.  \r\nComplete cardiac evaluation in 1989 which \r\nincluded cardiac catheterization revealed \r\ndiffuse coronary artery disease.  The \r\nnatural history of such diffuse coronary \r\nartery disease is progression of lesion \r\nseverity leading to subsequent myocardial \r\ninfarction and deterioration of \r\nventricular function.  The likelihood of \r\ndisease progression is increased by \r\nsmoking.  This is in fact the course of \r\nthis veteran's disease which is entirely \r\nexplained by the known risk factors and \r\nis not likely to have been significantly \r\naltered by the development of PTSD in \r\n1995.  Thus the cause of the veteran's \r\ncoronary artery disease is \r\natherosclerosis secondary to \r\nhyperlipidemia and smoking.  There is no \r\nevidence that PTSD either caused or \r\npermanently worsened the heart disease.\r\n\r\nII.  Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the claim for service connection for CAD \r\nsecondary to PTSD is well grounded, meaning plausible; the \r\nrelevant facts have been properly developed, and there is no \r\nfurther duty to assist the veteran with his claim.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5107 (a).  \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  Service \r\nincurrence for hypertension or organic heart disease will be \r\npresumed if manifest to a compensable level within one year \r\nafter service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; \r\n38 C.F.R. �� 3.307, 3.309.  It is neither claimed nor shown \r\nthat service connection for CAD is warranted on a direct or \r\npresumptive basis; the veteran's CAD first appeared many \r\nyears after his last separation from service in 1977.\r\n\r\nRather, the veteran asserts that service connection for CAD \r\nis warranted as being secondary to his service-connected \r\nPTSD.  Secondary service connection will be granted when a \r\ndisability is proximately due to or the result of a service \r\nconnected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310.  Secondary \r\nservice connection may be established for a disorder which is \r\naggravated by a service-connected disability; compensation \r\nmay be provided for the degree of disability (but only that \r\ndegree) over and above the degree of disability existing \r\nprior to the aggravation.  Allen v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 374 \r\n(1995).  \r\n\r\nThe record reveals that the veteran had a myocardial \r\ninfarction in January 1989 and was diagnosed with unstable \r\nangina.  In March 1989, a VA examiner noted that the \r\nveteran's social history (tobacco abuse) and family history \r\n(both father and sister died of myocardial infarction) were \r\nstrongly positive for coronary disease.  The veteran had \r\nseveral recurrent cardiac episodes from 1989 on, with no \r\nmention of PTSD as a contributing factor until May 1995, when \r\nthe veteran himself asserted a connection.  In fact the first \r\nmention of PTSD (or any psychiatric disorder) was in 1995.  \r\nIn May 1995, the veteran said he felt increased chest \r\npressure when he attended his PTSD session, similar to that \r\nfelt when he walked. \r\n\r\nIn a handwritten letter received by the RO in June 1996 (an \r\nAugust 1997 typewritten copy is also on file), a VA staff \r\nphysician of a VAMC cardiology section stated that stress was \r\na critical element in the development of atherosclerotic \r\nheart disease.  She said that it was her opinion that a \r\nsignificant part of the veteran's cardiac condition was \r\nservice-connected.  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that this medical opinion is outweighed by \r\nthe treatment records and by a more persuasive March 1999 \r\nopinion by a VA cardiologist who is the Chief of Cardiology \r\nof a VAMC.  The VA doctor who provided the March 1999 opinion \r\nreviewed the veteran's claims folder and concluded that his \r\nCAD was neither caused nor permanently worsened by his PTSD.  \r\nHe based his opinion on such factors as the known course of \r\nCAD, the veteran's strong family history of CAD and his \r\nhistory of smoking cigarettes, and the existence of CAD for 6 \r\nyears prior to the first diagnosis of PTSD.  He stated that \r\nthe cause of the veteran's CAD was atherosclerosis secondary \r\nto hyperlipidemia and smoking\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the medical evidence does not show that \r\nthe veteran's service-connected PTSD (diagnosed in 1995) \r\ncaused or permanently increased the severity of his CAD \r\n(diagnosed in 1989).  The rating decision which has been \r\nsubmitted, concerning a different veteran's case, does not \r\nestablish secondary service connection in the case of the \r\npresent appellant.  The lay statements by the veteran, \r\nasserting there is a connection between PTSD and CAD, are of \r\nno probative value, as a layman has no competence to offer a \r\nmedical opinion on diagnosis or etiology of a condition.  \r\nEspiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492 (1992).  The Board \r\nfinds the March 1999 VA medical expert opinion (finding that \r\nthe veteran's service-connected PTSD did not cause or worsen \r\nhis CAD) to be more persuasive than the earlier medical \r\nopinion submitted by the veteran, as the March 1999 opinion \r\ncontains more detailed rationale and was based on a thorough \r\nreview of historical records.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the evidence establishes that the veteran's \r\nservice-connected PTSD did not cause or aggravate his CAD.  \r\nCAD is not proximately due to or the result of a service-\r\nconnected disability, and the criteria for secondary service \r\nconnection are not met.  As the preponderance of the evidence \r\nis against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does \r\nnot apply, and secondary service connection must be denied.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5107 (b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 \r\n(1990). \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for CAD, secondary to PTSD, is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tL. W.

Howell, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from August 1960 to August \r\n1961.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a rating decision of the Department of \r\nVeterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Jackson, \r\nMississippi, which denied entitlement to service connection \r\nfor PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the veteran initially filed a claim in \r\n1992 for, among other things, PTSD.  By rating decision dated \r\nin January 1993, the RO denied entitlement to service \r\nconnection for PTSD on the basis that PTSD was not related to \r\nthe veteran's military service.  In December 1993, the \r\nveteran filed a claim for PTSD based on sexual trauma.  The \r\nRO apparently considered this a new claim for entitlement to \r\nservice connection for PTSD and undertook de novo review of \r\nthe claim.  The Board agreed with this analysis and, in \r\nNovember 1998, remanded the issue to the RO to schedule a \r\nhearing before the Board.  The RO scheduled a hearing and \r\nnotified the veteran but she failed to appear.  Thus, the \r\nrequested developments have been accomplished to the extent \r\npossible and the case is now ready for appellate review.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The RO has developed all evidence necessary for an \r\nequitable disposition of the veteran's claim.\r\n\r\n2.  The veteran's service medical records do not contain any \r\ncomplaints, findings, or diagnosis of a neuropsychiatric \r\ndisability of any kind.\r\n\r\n3.  PTSD was diagnosed in 1993 but it was not related to any \r\nevent or occurrence in service; rather, it was associated \r\nwith post-service incidents primarily involving the veteran's \r\nabusive husband and her son's death.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not shown to be incurred in or aggravated by the \r\nveteran's active duty service based on the evidence of \r\nrecord.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107 (West 1991 & Supp. 1999); \r\n38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304 (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nInitially, the Board finds that the veteran's claim is \"well \r\ngrounded\" within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a) (West \r\n1991 & Supp. 1999).  That is, she has presented a claim which \r\nis plausible.  Her evidentiary assertions are presumed \r\ncredible for the purposes of this determination.  All \r\nrelevant facts have been properly developed and no further \r\nassistance to the veteran is required to comply with the duty \r\nto assist mandated by 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a).  \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131 (West 1991 & Supp. 1999).  \r\nIf a chronic disease is shown in service, subsequent \r\nmanifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, \r\nhowever remote, may be service connected, unless clearly \r\nattributable to intercurrent causes.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b) \r\n(1998).  However, continuity of symptoms is required where \r\nthe condition in service is not, in fact, chronic or where \r\ndiagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b) (1998).\r\n\r\nIn addition, service connection may also be granted for any \r\ndisease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, \r\nincluding that pertinent to service, establishes that the \r\ndisease was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1113(b) (West \r\n1991 & Supp. 1999); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d) (1998).  The Board \r\nmust determine whether the evidence supports the claim or is \r\nin relative equipoise, with the veteran prevailing in either \r\ncase, or whether the preponderance of the evidence is against \r\nthe claim, in which case, service connection must be denied.  \r\nGilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\nWhile this appeal was pending, the applicable rating criteria \r\nfor service connection for PTSD, 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), was \r\namended on June 18, 1999, and made effective to March 7, \r\n1997.  See 64 Fed. Reg. 32807-32808 (June 18, 1999) (to be \r\ncodified at 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1999)).  Although the new \r\nregulation purports to essentially restate the three \r\nessential elements previously in effect, the timing of this \r\nchange in the regulations requires the Board to first \r\nconsider whether the amended regulation is more favorable to \r\nthe veteran than the prior regulation, and, if so, the Board \r\nmust apply the more favorable regulation.  VAOPGCPREC 11-97; \r\nKarnas v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 308 (1991).  In this case, \r\nthe Board finds that the change to the regulation as it \r\npertains to this case is not so significant that the Board is \r\nunable to proceed.  As there is no essential substantive \r\nchange affecting this case, neither the old nor the new \r\nprovisions are more liberal as affects this claim.  Thus, the \r\nBoard will adjudicate the veteran's claim pursuant to the \r\nregulations in effect at the relevant times. \r\n\r\nUnder the old regulations, service connection for PTSD \r\nrequired (i) a current, clear medical diagnosis of PTSD \r\n(presumed to include the adequacy of the PTSD symptomatology \r\nand the sufficiency of a claimed in-service stressor); (ii) \r\ncredible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service \r\nstressor actually occurred; and (iii) medical evidence of a \r\ncausal nexus between current symptomatology and the specific \r\nclaimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1998).  \r\nUnder the new regulations, service connection for PTSD \r\nrequires (i) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD, (ii) medical \r\nevidence establishing a link between current symptoms and an \r\nin-service stressor, and (iii) credible supporting evidence \r\nthat the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  See 64 Fed. \r\nReg. 32807-32808 (June 18, 1999).  \r\n\r\nWhen asked to interpret the old regulations, with respect to \r\nthe first element (a diagnosis of PTSD), the United States \r\nCourt of Appeals for Veterans Claims (formerly the United \r\nStates Court of Veterans Appeal) (the Veterans Claims Court) \r\nheld that \"a clear (that is, unequivocal) PTSD diagnosis by \r\na mental-health professional must be presumed . . . to have \r\nbeen made in accordance with the applicable DSM [Diagnostic \r\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders] criteria as to \r\nboth the adequacy of the symptomatology and the sufficiency \r\nof the stressor.\"  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 139 \r\n(1997).  Moreover, the Veterans Claims Court concluded that \r\n\"under the DSM-IV, the mental illness of PTSD would be \r\ntreated the same as a physical illness for purposes of VA \r\ndisability compensation in terms of predisposition toward \r\ndevelopment of that condition.\"  Id. at 141 (incorporating \r\nthe \"eggshell plaintiff\" rule to service connection \r\nawards).  \r\n\r\nIn interpreting the former second element, now third element \r\n(an in-service stressor), the Veterans Claims Court \r\ndetermined that the evidence necessary to establish that the \r\nclaimed stressor actually occurred varied depending on \r\nwhether it could be determined that the veteran \"engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy.\"  38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West 1991 & \r\nSupp. 1999).  The Veterans Claims Court held that \"[w]here \r\nit is determined, through recognized military citations or \r\nother supportive evidence, that the veteran was engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy and the claimed stressors are related \r\nto such combat, the veteran's lay testimony regarding claimed \r\nstressors must be accepted as conclusive as to their actual \r\noccurrence and no further development for corroborative \r\nevidence will be required, provided that the veteran's \r\ntestimony is found to be 'satisfactory,' e.g., credible, and \r\n'consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof [combat] service'.\"  Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 \r\n(1993); 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) (West 1991 & Supp. 1999); \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d), (f) (1998); see also Gaines v. West, 11 \r\nVet. App. 113 (1998) (determination of whether veteran \r\nengaged in combat with enemy is particularly significant in \r\nPTSD cases).  \r\n\r\nUnder the old regulations, if the claimed stressor was \r\nrelated to combat, service department evidence that the \r\nveteran engaged in combat or that the veteran was awarded the \r\nPurple Heart, Combat Infantryman Badge, or similar combat \r\ncitation would be accepted, in the absence of evidence to the \r\ncontrary, as conclusive evidence of the claimed in-service \r\nstressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1998).  Under the new \r\nregulations, the reference to combat citations was removed.  \r\nNonetheless, under both the old and the new regulations, if \r\nthe \"claimed stressor [was] not combat related, a veteran's \r\nlay testimony regarding in-service stressors [was] \r\ninsufficient to establish the occurrence of the stressor and \r\nmust be corroborated by 'credible supporting evidence'.\"  \r\nCohen, 10 Vet. App. at 142 (citing Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. \r\nApp. 389, 395 (1996); Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283 \r\n(1994)).  \r\n\r\nFurther, the Board notes that special evidentiary procedures \r\nfor PTSD claims based on personal assaults were established \r\nin February 1996 in VA Adjudication Procedure Manual M21-1, \r\nPart III, � 5.14(c) (Feb. 20, 1996).  In Patton v. West, 12 \r\nVet. App. 272 (1999), the Veterans Claims Court found that \r\nthe VA had undertaken a special obligation to assist a \r\nclaimant in producing corroborating evidence of an in-service \r\nstressor.  Thus, the Veterans Claims Court concluded that \r\nmore particularized requirements were established regarding \r\nthe development of alternative sources of information with \r\nrespect to personal assault claims as service records may be \r\ndevoid of evidence because victims of personal assault do not \r\nfile official reports.  Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272 \r\n(1999); YR v. West, 11 Vet. App. 393 (1998).  \r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, the Board notes that the service \r\nrecords do not support a finding that the veteran was engaged \r\nin combat, nor has she so claimed.  Rather, she maintains \r\nthat she was sexually assaulted in service and, as a result, \r\nsuffers from PTSD.  A review of the veteran's service medical \r\nrecords reveals no complaints, symptomatology, or findings of \r\na psychiatric disorder or of a sexual assault.  The August \r\n1961 separation examination report demonstrates a normal \r\npsychiatric evaluation.\r\n\r\nPost service medical records are negative for treatment for \r\nor a diagnosis of a psychiatric disability until many years \r\nafter separation from service.  In 1988, the veteran was \r\ntreated for situation depression and was noted to be in a \r\nstormy and unhappy marriage.  She had three children, one who \r\nhad been killed in an accident, one who was an alcoholic, and \r\nthe third who had \"problems.\"  A December 1988 medical \r\ncertificate shows that the veteran was treated for vaginal \r\nand pubic area soreness after she reported that her husband \r\nraped her.  Treatment notes dated in August 1990 reveal that \r\nshe was recently divorced and needed counseling with respect \r\nto her life adjustment problems.  Outpatient treatment \r\nrecords show on-going mental health counseling for a variety \r\nof issues, primarily focusing on her husband and family.  \r\n\r\nAn early 1992 mental health clinic treatment note shows that \r\nthe veteran was undergoing psychotherapy.  She had been going \r\nto physical therapy, vocational rehabilitation, and was \r\nconcerned over the effects of a fall some months previously.  \r\nShe alluded to many years of painful events, flashbacks, and \r\nwas worried about security in her new apartment but no basis \r\nof the concerns was reported.  She continued in psychotherapy \r\nthroughout 1992 and complained of nervousness, had nightmares \r\nof her husband choking her, and reported family discord \r\nbetween herself, her sister, and their mother.  She also \r\ndiscussed that she had talked to a District Attorney \r\nconcerning her husband's rape of her in 1988 and there were \r\nother references to her husband beating and raping her.  In \r\nthe May 1992, the veteran sought treatment for a problems \r\nwith her left elbow and reported a past medical history of \r\nrape trauma.  A mental health treatment plan diagnosis was \r\nnoted as adjustment disorder with depression.  In June 1992, \r\nshe filed her claim for PTSD.  Parenthetically, the Board \r\nnotes that she identified 1988 as the date her PTSD began.\r\n\r\nIn a December 1992 neurological examination, the veteran \r\nrelated a past medical  history of PTSD secondary to a rape \r\nby her ex-husband in December 1989.  She reported that she \r\nhad been diagnosed with PTSD two months previously.  In a \r\nJanuary 1993 VA PTSD examination report, the veteran related \r\nthat she completed high school at age 18 and entered the Air \r\nForce almost immediately, although the examiner noted an \r\ninconsistency between the veteran's recollection and the \r\nevidence in the file.  She commented that she did her work \r\nwell and was at the top of her class.  She remarked that she \r\nwas permitted to resign after two years of a three year \r\nenlistment because she had gotten married (although the \r\nrecord shows that she only served one year).  After service, \r\nshe raised her daughter (now grown) and thereafter worked at \r\nvarious jobs.  In 1976, she was in a serious automobile \r\naccident and had a long convalescence during which she had to \r\nlearn to walk again.  Apparently in 1984, she witnessed her \r\nson killed by a drunk driver and saw his badly mangled body \r\nin the accident.  She was thereafter hospitalized for 45 days \r\nand was diagnosed with stress and trauma.  She had been \r\nattending the Mental Health Clinic and reported that she had \r\nbeen diagnosed with PTSD.\r\n\r\nMental status examination revealed that she was neatly \r\ngroomed, and her facial expression was of slight depression.  \r\nHer speech was rather hurried, pressured, and at time showed \r\na bit of irritation when she had to find the exact date or \r\nsequence of events.  She complained of severe headaches and \r\nmuscle spasms, so severe that at times she was unable to \r\nwalk.  She reported that she did not trust people because she \r\nhad been actually raped twice and her employer had attempted \r\nto rape her on more than one occasion.  Her husband also put \r\na gun to her head and threatened to kill her because he was \r\nangry about alimony.  She reflected that the experiences made \r\nher relationship with men extremely difficult and she had \r\ndreams about past experiences but was unable to give a \r\ndefinite time or frequency of the experiences.  She related \r\nanother experience when her husband attempted to force her to \r\nperform fellatio and forced his penis into her mouth.  She \r\nobserved that she had this flashback once every month or two \r\nand it made her upset and angry.  She described feeling \r\ndejected, sad, and had infrequent crying spells.  She denied \r\nsuicidal thoughts.  She stated that she got along well with \r\nothers but did not have friends, only saw people at school \r\nand work.  She was in school on a full scholarship and had \r\ngotten high grades.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner noted that the veteran presented with a rather \r\nmixed psychiatric picture.  He noted there were many symptoms \r\nof PTSD, especially with regard to the rape attempts, her \r\nhusband's assault, and seeing the body of her dead son.  He \r\nalso identified a number of hysterical features and noted \r\nthat she was quite emotional during the interview.  He also \r\nremarked that she was mildly depressed.  He concluded, that \r\nthe major psychiatric picture was that of anxiety and the \r\nsymptoms of depression and hysterical features were \r\nassociated with the anxiety disorder.  The final diagnosis \r\nwas PTSD.\r\n\r\nBased on the evidence outlined above, the Board finds that, \r\neven assuming a current medical diagnosis of PTSD, the \r\nveteran has failed to show a medical nexus between her \r\ncurrent diagnosis of PTSD and active duty service.  \r\nSpecifically, there is no evidence of psychiatric treatment \r\nin service or until many years after service separation.  By \r\nthe veteran's own testimony, she sought psychiatric treatment \r\nin 1984 after witnessing the death of her son.  \r\n\r\nThe first evidence of a psychiatric disorder contained in the \r\nclaims file is dated in 1988, when, among other things, the \r\nveteran reported that she had been raped by her husband.  \r\nThereafter, she sought counseling for what was described as \r\nlife adjustment problems.  Again in 1992, she reported \r\nnightmares of her husband choking her, and had talked to \r\nofficials about a rape charge against her then-former \r\nhusband.  In a March 1992 outpatient treatment note, she \r\nrelated that her husband raped her and was addressing \r\nrelationship issues.  In June 1992, she filed a claim for \r\nentitlement to service connection for PTSD and identified \r\n1988 as the date her PTSD began.  This date coincides with \r\nthe reported rape by her husband.  A December 1992 \r\nneurological examination specifically noted a history of PTSD \r\nsecondary to a rape by her ex-husband.  Significantly, none \r\nof the medical examiners or treating psychologists attributed \r\nher psychiatric disorder to a rape in military service, nor \r\nhad she made such a claim at that point.\r\n\r\nIn December 1993, the veteran filed another claim for PTSD \r\nand alleged that she was raped in service.  She maintained \r\nthat she agreed to go on a blind date with another soldier, \r\nwho subsequently raped her.  She reflected that she had also \r\nbeen sexually harassed by her superior officer and felt \r\nhumiliated by the ordeal.  At a personal hearing in December \r\n1996, the veteran's friend testified that she had known the \r\nveteran for over two years.  She reflected that the veteran \r\ndid not trust easily, was not personal, was not outgoing, did \r\nnot laugh, and became nervous around men.  The veteran told \r\nher that she was that way because she was raped in the \r\nmilitary.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran testified, first, that she believed her DD214 was \r\nincorrect and that she thought she was in service from \r\nOctober 1960 until 1962.  Parenthetically, the Board notes \r\nthat service personnel records support the service as shown \r\non the DD214.  Nonetheless, she related that the military was \r\nhard on female personnel back then and she was harassed by \r\nher commanding officer.  She indicated that she was slapped \r\non the buttocks, invited to coffee when she was up for \r\npromotion, groped, and called a dyke and lessie.  She also \r\nrelated that she was raped on a blind date.  She maintained \r\nthat she reported the incident to the Provost Marshal's \r\noffice and to the police, but that the records were no longer \r\navailable.  She described the affect on her marriage and her \r\nhusband had a disagreement with an officer over her.  She \r\nreported that a letter was sent to her father about the \r\nincident.  She described how the incident had affected her \r\nwork and school.\r\n\r\nOf concern to the Board is the letter submitted by the \r\nveteran in support of her claim.  The letter, dated in August \r\n1961, is purportedly from the VA to the veteran's father \r\nregarding a sexual assault in service and her subsequent \r\ntreatment.  First, as initially recognized by the RO, the \r\nletterhead indicates that the letter is from the Department \r\nof Veterans Affairs.  However, in 1961, VA was not a cabinet-\r\nlevel department and was known as the Veterans \r\nAdministration.  In addition, although the letter has a VA \r\nseal, it is the seal of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \r\nnot the Veterans Administration.  Further, although it \r\nappears that the letter was meant to be sent by a treating \r\nphysician, the phraseology and cadence are lacking, including \r\ngrammatical and sentence structure errors.  Moreover, there \r\nis no signature on the letter as it appears that the bottom \r\nof the letter was torn and recopied.  Finally, if this \r\nhappened while the veteran was in service, notice would most \r\nlikely have come to her family from the service department, \r\nnot the VA.  Therefore, the Board doubts the validity of the \r\nletter and has serious concerns regarding the over-all \r\ncredibility of the veteran to submit this letter in support \r\nof her claim.  Because the evidence indicates that the letter \r\nwas not, in fact, as represented by the veteran, the Board \r\nwill place minimal weight on the evidence contained therein.  \r\n\r\nThe Board also notes that the VA physician who diagnosed PTSD \r\nrelated that the veteran had reported two occasions of being \r\nraped, and several incidents of attempted rape by her \r\nemployer.  These appear to be separate incidents from the \r\nalleged rape by her husband, although she did report an \r\nincident with her husband of forced fellatio.  Significantly, \r\nher psychiatric symptomatology appeared to be centered on the \r\nincidents with her husband and her son's death, and at no \r\ntime did she suggest, nor did the examiner consider in making \r\na diagnosis, that the alleged rapes had taken place in \r\nservice.  Accordingly, there was no mention of the veteran's \r\nactive duty service in connection with the diagnosis of PTSD \r\nat the time it was made.  Even though the veteran has since \r\nstressed that at least one of the rapes occurred in service, \r\nthe Veterans Claims Court has held that the Board is not \r\nobligated to accept medical opinions premised on the \r\nveteran's recitation of medical history.  See Godfrey v. \r\nBrown, 8 Vet. App. 113 (1995).  \r\n\r\nThe Board has also reviewed this claim in view of the recent \r\nholdings in Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272 (1999) and YR v. \r\nWest, 11 Vet. App. 393 (1998) concerning development and the \r\napplicability of certain Manual provisions.  The Board finds \r\nthat all alternative sources of information in an attempt to \r\ndevelop the veteran's claims have been exhausted.  According \r\nto the veteran's own testimony, attempts were made to obtain \r\ncopies of the reports she maintained were filed at the time \r\nof the incident without success.  Moreover, to the extent \r\nthat the veteran submitted secondary evidence in the form of \r\na letter purportedly from VA to her father dated in 1961, the \r\nBoard has also noted that that evidence will be afforded less \r\nweight for the reasons described above.  Further, there is no \r\nsuggestion in the service medical records of a change of \r\nbehavior which may have evidenced the occurrence of an in-\r\nservice stressor.  The Board has examined all the evidence of \r\nrecord with a view toward determining whether the veteran \r\nnotified VA of the possible existence of relevant \r\ninformation; however, the Board finds no such information \r\npresent.  See Beausoleil v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 459, 464-65 \r\n(1996); Robinette v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 69, 80 (1995).\r\n\r\nFinally, the Board has also considered the statement of the \r\nveteran's friend that she has known the veteran for two years \r\nand was told by the veteran that she had been raped in \r\nservice.  The testimony, in 1996, does not provide a basis \r\nfor relating PTSD to service, some 35 years earlier, nor is \r\nshe competent to make that medical connection.  See Espiritu \r\nv. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492 (1992).\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Board finds that even assuming a current \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD, the medical evidence does not related the \r\ndiagnosis to any in-service occurrence or event.  \r\nAccordingly, the veteran has failed to show a medical nexus \r\nbetween service and PTSD, as required by law, and the claim \r\nmust be denied.  Finally, the above reported findings support \r\nthe conclusion that the veteran failed to establish a medical \r\nnexus between a current diagnosis of PTSD and military \r\nservice under the \"old\" regulation as well.  As noted, \r\nthere appears to be no substantive difference in the \r\napplication of the old and new regulations as they apply to \r\nthis case.  The findings reported above fail to show a \r\nmedical nexus.  Thus, the grant of entitlement to service \r\nconnection for PTSD is not warranted under any of the \r\napplicable criteria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t(CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tMICHAEL D.

L. Wasser, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from October 1982 to March \r\n1992.\r\n\r\nThis case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\nfrom an August 1997 RO decision which, in pertinent part, \r\ndenied service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends he has PTSD, which is attributable to \r\ntraumatic experiences while serving in Saudi Arabia during \r\nthe Persian Gulf War.  His service personnel records show \r\nthat he served in Saudi Arabia from December 1990 to May 1991 \r\nas a laundry and bath specialist.  His service records do not \r\nindicate that he engaged in combat.\r\n\r\nThe veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD is well \r\ngrounded, meaning not inherently implausible, and the file \r\nindicates there is a further VA duty to assist him in \r\ndeveloping facts pertinent to the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n5107(a) (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.103(a), 3.159 (1998); \r\nGaines v. West, 11 Vet. App. 353 (1998).\r\n\r\nBy a statement dated in September 1996, the veteran said that \r\nhe was treated for PTSD at the Brooklyn VA Medical Center \r\n(VAMC) in May or June 1996.  The RO then obtained one VA \r\noutpatient treatment record dated in June 1996.  In \r\nstatements dated in June and July 1997, the veteran said he \r\nhad subsequently received additional VA treatment for PTSD at \r\nthe Brooklyn VAMC, and at the Vet Center at 25 Chapel Street.  \r\nThe Board finds that such records should be obtained.  See \r\nBell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992) (VA medical records \r\nare in constructive possession of the agency, and must be \r\nobtained if the material could be determinative of the \r\nclaim).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 4.125(a) [i.e., under the criteria of DSM-IV]; a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence, between current symptoms and \r\nan in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that \r\nthe claimed in-service stressor occurred.  If the evidence \r\nestablishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy \r\nand the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the \r\nabsence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and \r\nprovided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the \r\ncircumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's \r\nservice, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the \r\noccurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.304(f) (revised June 18, 1999, effective March 7, 1997, 64 \r\nFed. Reg. 32807 (1999)). \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that if the veteran did not engage in combat, \r\nhis statements are inadequate to prove the occurrence of a \r\nstressor in service; such a stressor must be established by \r\nofficial service records or other credible supporting \r\nevidence.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f); Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. \r\n128 (1997); Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283 (1994). \r\n\r\nBy a letter to the veteran dated in September 1996, the RO \r\nrequested that he provide information on the alleged \r\ntraumatic events which he experienced during service, \r\nincluding names, dates, locations, and unit numbers.  The \r\nveteran did not respond to this letter.\r\n\r\nAt an October 1996 VA psychiatric examination, the veteran \r\nreported that during his service in Saudi Arabia, he worked \r\nin a supply depot of a military hospital, and saw some \r\nAmerican and Iraqi casualties.  He also reported that on one \r\noccasion, a scud missile exploded 2 miles away.  The examiner \r\ndiagnosed PTSD, alcohol abuse in remission, cannabis abuse in \r\nremission, and dysthymia.  The examiner apparently based the \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD on the above unverified stressors reported \r\nby the veteran.\r\n\r\nBy a letter to the veteran dated in April 1997, the RO again \r\nasked for information regarding the alleged stressful events \r\nin service.  By a statement received in June 1997, the \r\nveteran said that during service he recalled seeing wounded \r\nIraqi soldiers who came to the hospitals as a result of a \r\nscud missile attack.  He did not provide any details \r\nregarding dates or locations.\r\n\r\nThere is no indication that the RO made any efforts to \r\ncorroborate the veteran's statements of stressors with the \r\nU.S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records \r\n(USASCRUR).  In an effort to assist the veteran in completing \r\nhis claim for service connection for PTSD, the Board finds \r\nthat additional development (including an attempt to verify \r\nclaimed in-service stressors, and the other action outlined \r\nbelow) is warranted.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, the case is REMANDED to the RO for the following \r\ndevelopment:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should forward the veteran's \r\nstatements of alleged service stressors \r\n(along with copies of his service \r\npersonnel records and any other relevant \r\nevidence) to the USASCRUR, and request \r\nthat organization investigate and attempt \r\nto verify the alleged stressors.\r\n\r\n2.  The RO should obtain any medical \r\nrecords of VA psychiatric treatment of \r\nthe veteran at the Brooklyn VAMC and at \r\nthe Vet Center at 25 Chapel Street since \r\n1996.\r\n\r\n3.  If the veteran's claimed stressors \r\nare verified by USASCRUR, the RO should \r\nobtain a medical opinion from the VA \r\ndoctor who performed the October 1996 \r\npsychiatric examination.  The doctor \r\nshould be asked to clearly identify the \r\nclaimed events which are considered \r\nstressors supporting his diagnosis of \r\nPTSD, and he should fully explain why the \r\nstressors are considered sufficient under \r\nthe standards of DSM-IV.\r\n\r\nIf the doctor who performed the October \r\n1996 VA examination is unavailable, the \r\nveteran should be afforded another VA \r\npsychiatric examination concerning \r\nclaimed PTSD.  The claims folder must be \r\nprovided to and reviewed by the examiner.  \r\nPTSD should be diagnosed or ruled out in \r\naccordance with the standards of DSM-IV.  \r\nIf PTSD is diagnosed, the doctor should \r\nclearly identify the claimed events which \r\nare considered stressors supporting the \r\ndiagnosis, and the doctor should fully \r\nexplain why the stressors are considered \r\nsufficient under the standards of DSM-IV.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the RO should review the claim for service \r\nconnection for PTSD.  If the claim remains denied, then a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case should be issued to the \r\nveteran, and he should be given an opportunity to respond.  \r\nThen, the case should be returned to the Board for further \r\nappellate review.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter the Board has remanded to the RO.  \r\nKutscherousky v.

J. Nottle, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from June 1951 to February \r\n1955.  His appeal ensues from a July 1998 rating decision of \r\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in \r\nSt. Louis, Missouri (RO).  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The veteran's claim is plausible and VA has fulfilled its \r\nduty to assist by properly and fully developing all relevant \r\nevidence necessary for its equitable disposition.  \r\n\r\n2.  The evidence of record includes a clear diagnosis of \r\nPTSD, and an opinion linking PTSD to an in-service stressor.\r\n\r\n3.  The veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy.\r\n\r\n4.  The record contains credible supporting evidence that the \r\nclaimed stressor actually occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was incurred in active service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, \r\n1131, 5107 (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 \r\n(1998).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that he developed PTSD as a result of \r\nexperiencing service-related stressors while serving aboard \r\nthe USS Juneau during the Korean conflict from April 1952 to \r\nNovember 1952.  These stressors included acting as a gunner, \r\nwhich required taking out enemy ships, being under constant \r\nfire from the enemy, and witnessing the sinking of several \r\nNorth Korean ships.  Based on the veteran's contentions, \r\nwhich are presumed to be credible for the purpose of \r\ndetermining well groundedness, and on medical evidence of \r\nrecord linking PTSD to the claimed stressors, the Board finds \r\nthe claim plausible, and therefore, well grounded within the \r\nmeaning of 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a) (West 1991).  See Grivois v. \r\nBrown, 6 Vet.App. 136, 140 (1994) (holding that a well-\r\ngrounded claim is one that is plausible, capable of \r\nsubstantiation or meritorious on its own).  The Board also \r\nfinds that VA has fulfilled its duty to assist by properly \r\nand fully developing all relevant evidence necessary for the \r\nequitable disposition of the veteran's claim.  \r\n\r\nService connection may be established by affirmatively \r\nshowing inception of an injury or disability in service.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (1998).  Service \r\nconnection for PTSD requires medical evidence establishing a \r\nclear diagnosis of the condition, competent medical evidence \r\nlinking current PTSD symptomatology to the claimed in service \r\nstressor, and credible supporting evidence that the claimed \r\nstressor actually occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  In this \r\ncase, while the veteran's mental problems have been variously \r\ndiagnosed since discharge from service, the evidence of \r\nrecord includes several diagnoses of PTSD.  In fact, since \r\nJanuary 1998, the veteran has participated as an inpatient in \r\na PTSD group therapy program, and has consistently been \r\ndiagnosed with PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of record also includes a medical opinion \r\nlinking the veteran's PTSD to at least one of the veteran's \r\nclaimed in-service stressors.  A VA examiner who evaluated \r\nthe veteran in May 1998 diagnosed the veteran with PTSD and \r\nindicated that this diagnosis was affected by the stress the \r\nveteran experienced while serving on a cruiser in a heavy \r\ncombat zone during the Korean conflict and being bombarded by \r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Court has held that, in adjudicating a claim for PTSD, \r\nthe evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a \r\nstressor during service varies depending on whether the \r\nveteran was \"engaged in combat with the enemy.\"  Hayes v. \r\nBrown, 5 Vet.App. 60, 66 (1993).  If it is shown through \r\nmilitary citation or other appropriate evidence that a \r\nveteran engaged in combat with the enemy, and the claimed \r\nstressors are related to combat, the veteran's lay testimony \r\nregarding the reported stressors must be accepted as \r\nconclusive evidence of their actual occurrence, provided the \r\ntestimony is found to be satisfactory, e.g., credible and \r\n\"consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof such service.\"  In such cases, no further developmental \r\nor corroborative evidence is necessary.  38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n1154(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d).  However, if the evidence \r\ndemonstrates that the veteran did not engage in combat with \r\nthe enemy, or the claimed stressor is not related to combat, \r\nthe veteran's lay testimony alone is not sufficient to \r\nestablish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.  In such \r\ncases, the evidence must include evidence that corroborates \r\nthe veteran's testimony as to the occurrence of the claimed \r\nstressor.  Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet.App. 163 (1996) (holding \r\nthat the veteran's own testimony as a matter of law cannot by \r\nitself establish the existence of a stressor); Moreau v. \r\nBrown, 9 Vet.App. 389, 395-6 (1996) (holding that credible \r\nsupporting evidence of the actual existence of a stressor \r\ncannot consist solely of a noncombat veteran's solitary \r\ntestimony or an after-the-fact medical nexus based on such \r\ntestimony).\r\n\r\nThe veteran's DD Form 214 (Report of Separation from the \r\nArmed Forces of the United States) shows that the veteran \r\nserved on the USS Juneau during his tour of duty, which \r\nextended from June 1951 to February 1955.  It also shows that \r\nhe received the National Defense Service Medal, Navy \r\nOccupation Service Medal, Korean Service Medal, and the \r\nUnited Nations Service Medal, but no combat-related medals or \r\ncitations for his service.  According to Administrative \r\nRemarks dated September 1952, the veteran's service on the \r\nUSS Juneau from April 1952 to August 1953 involved \r\nparticipation in Task Force 77, which engaged in surface \r\nbombardment, gun strikes and combat operations in the Korean \r\ncombat zone.  As the record stands, the Board is unclear \r\nwhether the veteran's participation in these operations \r\nconstitutes combat duty.  Therefore, supporting evidence of \r\nthe veteran's statements is necessary to prove the occurrence \r\nof the claimed stressors.\r\n\r\nThe Court has held that \"credible supporting\" evidence of a \r\nnoncombat stressor can be met by other than service records.  \r\nDoran v. Brown, 6 Vet.App. 283, 289 (1994).  The RO in this \r\ncase has not attempted to verify any of the stressors alleged \r\nby the veteran.  However, the Board believes that the \r\naforementioned Administrative Remarks, in conjunction with \r\nnewspaper clippings, bombline summaries and radio press news \r\nreports submitted in April 1998, as part of the veteran's \r\nservice diary, support the veteran's allegations that the in-\r\nservice stressors actually occurred.  These documents \r\ndisclose that the veteran served on an anti-aircraft cruiser \r\nin a heavy combat zone and participated in surface \r\nbombardments, activities which the May 1998 VA examiner \r\nindicated were affecting the veteran's PTSD. \r\n\r\nThe evidence of record includes a clear diagnosis of PTSD, an \r\nopinion linking PTSD to an in-service stressor, and credible \r\nevidence that the claimed stressor actually occurred.  The \r\nBoard thus finds that the evidence supports the veteran's \r\nclaim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD, and that \r\nthis claim must be granted. \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tJOHN R.

Bryant, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active military service from December 1947 to \r\nOctober 1951.  \r\n\r\nThis matter originally came to the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from an April 1993 rating decision by the \r\nRO.  In an August 1996 decision the Board determined that new \r\nand material evidence had been submitted to reopen the claim \r\nof service connection for a psychiatric disorder to include \r\nPTSD.  The RO was also instructed to further develop the PTSD \r\nclaim.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The veteran experienced a non-combat related stressor \r\nduring service which has been corroborated.  \r\n\r\n2.  The veteran has been clearly diagnosed as having PTSD \r\nwith depression which developed due to the confirmed \r\ninservice stressor.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD with depression is due to disease or injury incurred in \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107(b) (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f) (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFactual Background\r\n\r\nService medical records show the veteran was initially \r\nhospitalized in 1951 with a diagnosis of epilepsy.  \r\nEvaluation revealed the veteran was inadequate, immature, \r\nunstable, impulsive, egocentric and anxious.  The final \r\ndiagnosis was emotional instability reaction.  He was \r\ndischarged from service on the recommendation of a Medical \r\nReview Board and the condition was noted to have existed \r\nprior to enlistment and was not aggravated by service.  The \r\nveteran's discharge papers show that he was in the United \r\nStates Navy and was a Seaman Apprentice.  He served aboard \r\nthe U.S.S. P.C.S. 1423.\r\n\r\nIn a January 1952 Social Survey report, the veteran's mother \r\nstated the veteran was nervous and constantly complained of \r\nheadaches.  She indicated his primary problem was his alcohol \r\nuse.  She stated that his drinking began in service and that \r\nthe veteran blamed it on his headaches.  \r\n\r\nA January 1952 hospital summary shows the veteran was treated \r\nfor chronic alcoholism resulting in a convulsive disorder.\r\n\r\nA February 1952 VA neuropsychiatric examination report shows \r\nthe veteran reported he felt pretty good, except for \r\noccasional headaches.  On examination his speech was low, \r\nrelevant, coherent and logical and orientation was clear.  \r\nHis mental trends were introverted and self-accusatory.  He \r\nhad no definite phobias, delusions, hallucinations or \r\nparanoid trends.  His insight and integration were good and \r\njudgment and motivation were fair.  The veteran was noted to \r\nbe well adjusted socially and industrially when not drinking.  \r\nThe symptoms were diagnosed as emotional instability, \r\nmanifested by excessive alcoholic indulgence, excitability \r\nand ineffectiveness when confronted with minor stress, which \r\nconstituted a congenital personality disorder.  \r\n\r\nIn March 1962 the RO receive statements from several \r\nindividuals in which they attested that the veteran suffered \r\nfrom epileptic seizures.  The veteran later submitted \r\nadditional lay statements from several individuals who \r\nattested the veteran was not an alcoholic.  \r\n\r\nIn a July 1962 statement the veteran claimed that his \r\nseizures were brought on by a nervous condition during his \r\nstay in service.  \r\n\r\nIn his 1992 claim for service connection, the veteran \r\nreported that in service he was severely reprimanded by his \r\ncaptain for almost releasing depth charges on a submarine \r\ndirectly beneath the ship.  Had the charges been released, \r\nthe submarine would have been destroyed and everyone on board \r\nkilled.  He reported that he began having nightmares in which \r\nhe saw dead sailors and scattered debris, and the parents of \r\ndead soldiers pointing fingers at him and telling him that it \r\nwas all his fault and that he should be killed for what he \r\ndid.  He reported that he began drinking heavily after the \r\nincident.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran underwent a VA psychiatric examination in \r\nFebruary 1993.  He reported that while serving on ship U.S.S. \r\nP.C.S. 1423, he became an assistant gunner's mate.  He stated \r\nthat he was given the responsibilities of gunner's mate after \r\nthe chief gunner's mate was court martialed for incompetence.  \r\nHe again related the story involving the depth charges \r\nincident stating that he was very upset after this incident \r\nand that many of the other men on the ship teased him calling \r\nhim \"the brain\".  The veteran stated that on another \r\noccasion the captain ordered him to beat up another sailor \r\nwho had stolen money and in another incident was criticized \r\nfor not following orders correctly.  The veteran complained \r\nthat he occasionally felt anxious and in recent years less \r\nactive.  He had recurring nightmares about the incidents in \r\nservice, particularly the one involving the depth charges.  \r\nPsychological testing was conducted which indicated the \r\nveteran had a strong tendency to exaggerate the report of \r\npsychological symptoms.  The examiner determined the \r\nveteran's testing results in conjunction with the results of \r\nthe interview, did not show a psychoneurotic disorder and \r\nthere was no evidence of any significant symptoms of PTSD.  \r\n\r\nOn psychological evaluation in February 1993 the examiner \r\nreported there was no combat exposure noted in the veteran's \r\nhistory or in available documentation.  The examiner noted \r\nthe veteran's complaints of flashbacks stating that they were \r\nmore likely ruminations about the event.  The clinical \r\nimpression was generalized anxiety disorder and history of \r\nalcohol abuse in remission for 25 years.  There was no \r\nindication that the anxiety disorder was related to service.  \r\nThe examiner concluded that although the veteran experienced \r\ngreat distress with the described incident, it was not an \r\nevent that was outside the range of common experiences that \r\nwould produce significant symptoms of distress in most people \r\nand that the veteran did not present a stressor of \r\nsignificant severity or duration to meet the diagnostic \r\ncriteria for PTSD.  \r\n\r\nDuring a March 1994 RO hearing the veteran testified \r\nregarding the events with the armed depth charges.  He also \r\nclaimed as inservice stressors an event in which he was \r\nordered to disarm a fellow sailor, an order by his captain to \r\nshoot a sailor who had stolen money if the sailor re-boarded \r\nthe ship and that he was he was later reprimanded by his \r\ncaptain after following orders to increase the number of \r\ngrenades used to create an explosion.  He stated that as a \r\nresult of these incidents he was ridiculed by his shipmates \r\nand called \"the brain\" and \"the enemy's best weapon\" and \r\nthat as a result he developed a serious aversion to being on \r\na ship, the ocean and San Diego.  He testified that he began \r\ndrinking heavily in order to have the nerve to kill himself, \r\nand that he tried to commit suicide on multiple occasions.  \r\n\r\nAdditional evidence submitted in support of the claim \r\nincludes a June 1993 lay statement from an individual \r\nrelating his observations of the veteran's nightmares.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran has submitted multiple medical reports from \r\nvarious therapists indicating that he has PTSD as the result \r\nof the inservice stressors.  A March 1994 report from a \r\nclinical social worker specifically states that the \r\ndiagnostic criteria for PTSD had been satisfied and that the \r\nveteran experienced what was for him a psychologically \r\ndistressing event that was outside the range of usual human \r\nexperience when he came close to destroying the Navy's own \r\nmanned submarine.  \r\n\r\nA March 1994 report from private psychiatrist, C.T.H. \r\nFriedmann, M.D. states that although the veteran had the \r\nsigns and symptoms of PTSD, the claimed stressors were not as \r\ngreat as ones normally seen as causing wartime PTSD.  The \r\npsychiatrist went on to state that he strongly suspected that \r\nthe veteran had an underlying schizoaffective disorder that \r\nwas unmasked by alcohol and the stress of service and had \r\nbeen present ever since.  \r\n\r\nReports from VA psychiatrists between 1994 and 1996 provide \r\ndiagnoses of chronic, combat-related PTSD.  Specifically, in \r\na July 1994 report psychiatrist J.W. Katzmann stated that \r\nalthough the veteran did not have combat experience, he had \r\nPTSD as the result of being led to believe his mistake could \r\nhave resulted in the deaths of many people and the \r\nhumiliation that he was made to experience as a result of \r\nthat incident.  \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Board's August 1996 remand, the RO requested \r\nverification of the veteran's stressors from the U.S. Army & \r\nJoint Services Environmental Support Group (now the United \r\nStates Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records) \r\n(USASCRUR).  The RO also requested copies of the deck log of \r\nthe U.S.S. P.C.S. from the National Archives.  \r\n\r\nIn October 1996, the National Archives responded that after \r\nexamining the deck log they could find no references to \r\nevents as described by the veteran.  They further stated that \r\nthe kind of details of events which would verify the \r\nveteran's claims rarely appear in these logs. \r\n\r\nIn August 1996, the RO also sent the veteran a letter \r\nrequesting more specific information in order to verify the \r\nspecific incidents claims as stressors.  The veteran \r\nresponded to the RO's letter in September 1996.  He related \r\nin more detail the incident involving the depth charges.  He \r\nstated that his rank was seaman apprentice but that on that \r\nparticular occasion he was acting gunner's mate.  He was told \r\nby the captain to arm depth chares and prepare to drop them \r\nat sea.  The veteran stated that he was not sure of this \r\nprocedure and asked other gunner's mates for information.  He \r\nstated that the captain gave the order to fire the depth \r\ncharge and that this was related to him over the phone, by a \r\nperson named LeMaster.  The veteran stated that this \r\nindividual told him it would be a firing run and not a \r\ntraining run.  However before he could carry out the order \r\nthe captain ordered the veteran into the wardroom and \r\nscreamed at him asking who ordered the depth charges be \r\nfired.  The veteran replied that he received the order over \r\nthe phone.  The captain then told him that he did not give \r\nthat order and that if the veteran had fired it would have \r\nbeen a direct hit to a submarine below.  The veteran was \r\nlater told by his shipmates that the firing was done after \r\nthe submarine surfaced.  He stated that the crew constantly \r\nharassed him about the incident and called him \"the brain\" \r\nin a derogatory manner and stenciled \"brain\" on his \r\nclothing and locker.  The veteran stated that on another \r\noccasion he was ordered to disarm a shipmate who was unable \r\nto control his weapon from firing wildly.  In the process the \r\nveteran was almost struck in the head by a stray bullet.  On \r\nanother occasion he was reprimanded harshly by the captain \r\nfor following orders to tie several grenades together to \r\ncreate a larger explosion.  Another incident occurred when \r\nthe veteran was ordered by the captain to shoot a former \r\nshipmate who had stolen money.  The veteran was overwhelmed \r\nwith fear that the man would board the ship and he would be \r\nexpected to shoot him.  The veteran provided the names of \r\nseveral shipmates who served with him including that of the \r\ncaptain, Frank McMullin.  \r\n\r\nIn a subsequent response in January 1997 the National \r\nArchives indicated that a ship's deck log is a brief record \r\nof the internal administrative and mechanical working of the \r\nship.  Furthermore, a deck log contained little information \r\nregarding the mission in which the ship is involved and is \r\nnot a detailed journal describing all the events transpiring \r\nin and around the ship.  \r\n\r\nIn October 1997 USASCRUR responded that records concerning \r\nthe U.S.S. P.C.S. 1432 could not be located and as a result \r\nthe veteran's stressor incidents could not be verified.  \r\nFurthermore stressors, such as the ones involving the veteran \r\nbeing led to arm depth charges or to disarm someone are \r\nseldom found in the combat records.  \r\n\r\nDuring psychological evaluation in June 1998 the examiner \r\nconcluded that based on current examination and review of \r\npast medical records, it appeared that the veteran met all of \r\nthe criteria necessary for the diagnosis of both PTSD and \r\nmajor depression.  The examiner also indicated that the \r\nveteran's major depression existed concurrently with the PTSD \r\nand in all likelihood was a direct result of his experiences \r\nwhile in the Navy.  \r\n\r\nOn VA psychiatric examination in July 1998 the examiner \r\nconcluded the veteran suffered from longstanding depression \r\nwhich did not appear to be related to his service activities.  \r\nAlthough the veteran's inservice symptoms, decreased sleep \r\nand crying seemed to be evoked by the incident he suffered as \r\na gunner's mate, the other symptoms of depression developed \r\nlater on as there is no diagnosis of depression until 1987.  \r\nThe examiner noted that someone with the veteran's described \r\nsymptoms could not have performed as a supervisor as the \r\nveteran did for a number of years.  He stated the veteran's \r\ndepression although chronic is relatively new and the \r\nconnection to any service experience would thus be extremely \r\ndubious and farfetched.  With respect to PTSD the examiner \r\nstated that the criteria for DSM-IV, PSTD are met but the \r\nveteran's PTSD was not severe enough to prevent him from \r\nfunctioning occupationally and socially.  The veteran's \r\nfamily and employment history indicate that even though his \r\nPTSD is related to service it was not of sufficiently \r\npowerful to inhibit his functioning.  \r\n\r\nAdditional evidence submitted in support of the claim include \r\na February 1999 lay statement from the veteran's wife \r\nrelating her observation of the veteran's mental condition \r\nsubsequent to active duty.  She indicated that an attempt was \r\nmade to contact the veteran's former shipmates.  However the \r\nveteran became so upset that the idea was abandoned and that \r\nthere were unable to locate anyone who could help verify the \r\nincidents.  Furthermore the one friend who would have been \r\nthe best witness for the veteran had passed away several \r\nyears ago.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the veteran's claim of service \r\nconnection for a psychiatric disorder to include PTSD is \r\nwell-grounded within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(a) \r\n(West 1991).  That is, it is \"a plausible claim, one which \r\nis meritorious on its own or capable of substantiation.\"  \r\nMurphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet.App 78, 81 (1990).  \r\n\r\nAt the outset, the Board notes that the veteran had active \r\nservice in the Navy as a Seaman Apprentice aboard the U.S.S. \r\nP.C.S. 1423.  The record does not reflect that the veteran \r\nhad combat service nor does the veteran contend that his \r\nstressors were related to combat service.\r\n\r\nIn the veteran's case, the service medical records are \r\nnegative for complaints, findings or treatment for an \r\nacquired psychiatric disorder in service.  Although the \r\nevidence of record shows treatment for symptoms associated \r\nwith emotional instability during his period of service, a \r\npsychiatric diagnosis was not made.  The first clinical \r\nreference to a psychiatric disorder is in a 1993 VA \r\nexamination wherein generalized anxiety was diagnosed.  The \r\nexaminer stated that it was not related to service.  Since \r\nthat time, various psychiatric examiners have opined that the \r\nveteran does not have PTSD and/or does not have depression \r\ndue to service.  However, other psychiatric examiners have \r\ndiagnosed the veteran on numerous occasions as having PTSD \r\nwith depression, both related to service.  \r\n\r\nDuring the course of the veteran's appeal, the regulation \r\ngoverning service connection for PTSD was amended, 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f), in accordance with the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims' (known as the United States \r\nCourt of Veterans Appeals prior to March 1, 1999) \r\n(hereinafter, \"the Court\") decision in Cohen v. Brown, 10 \r\nVet. App. 128 (1997).  The effective date of the changes in \r\nthe regulation was March 7, 1997.  The Board notes that the \r\nCourt has held that where the law or regulation changes after \r\na claim has been filed or reopened but before the \r\nadministrative or judicial appeal process has been concluded, \r\nthe version most favorable to the veteran will apply unless \r\nCongress provided otherwise or permitted the Secretary to \r\nprovide otherwise and the Secretary did so.  Karnas v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 308 (1990).  As such, the veteran's \r\nclaim must be considered under the regulation in effect prior \r\nto March 7, 1997 as well as the regulation in effect as of \r\nMarch 7, 1997.  \r\n\r\nIn adjudicating a claim for PTSD, the applicable VA \r\nregulation states that service connection for PTSD requires \r\nmedical evidence establishing a clear diagnosis of the \r\ncondition, credible supporting evidence that the claimed \r\ninservice stressor actually occurred, and a link, established \r\nby medical evidence between current symptomatology and the \r\nclaimed inservice stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1998).\r\n\r\nIn the case of Cohen, the Court issued directives to be \r\nfollowed in cases where the issue is service connection for \r\nPTSD.  The Board will briefly review these directives.  In \r\nsum, in the Cohen case, the Court confirmed that the evidence \r\nmust show that the veteran has a clear diagnosis of PTSD, \r\nthat the veteran was exposed to a stressor(s) during service \r\n(which may be combat or non-combat service), and a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence, between current \r\nsymptomatology and the claimed inservice stressor.  \r\n\r\nIn the Cohen case, the Court provided distinctions between \r\nnon-combat and combat service.  In cases of non-combat \r\nservice, the Court indicated that 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) is \r\nnot applied.  If the veteran did not serve in combat and his \r\nstressor is therefore, not combat-related, the Court \r\nindicated that the veteran's own lay testimony is \r\ninsufficient to establish the occurrence of the stressor and \r\nmust be corroborated by credible supporting evidence.  The \r\nCohen case indicated that credible supporting evidence \r\nincludes lay/comrade statements as well as service department \r\nverification.  \r\n\r\nAs noted, the veteran did not have combat service.  Thus, the \r\nveteran's own lay testimony is insufficient to establish the \r\noccurrence of the stressor and must be corroborated by \r\ncredible supporting evidence.  As such, the Board must make \r\nan initial determination as to whether any of the veteran's \r\nalleged stressors factually occurred.  \r\n\r\nIn order to verify the veteran's stressors, the RO requested \r\nverification of the veteran's stressors from the USASCRUR and \r\nalso requested copies of the deck log of the U.S.S. P.C.S. \r\n1423 from the National Archives.  The USASCRUR responded that \r\nrecords concerning the P.C.S. 1432 could not be located and \r\nas a result the veteran's stressor incidents could not be \r\nverified.  The National Archives responded that the kind of \r\ndetails of events which would verify the veteran's claims \r\nrarely appear in these logs and could not be verified.  As \r\nsuch, the veteran's stressors cannot be verified by those \r\ntypes of service department records.  Likewise, there is no \r\nlay evidence regarding the veteran's specific inservice \r\nstressors other than the veteran's own contentions.  However, \r\nthe Board notes that the veteran did serve aboard the U.S.S. \r\nP.C.S. 1423 and also was treated for symptoms associated with \r\nemotional instability during his period of service.  This \r\nevidence is consistent with the veteran's report that he \r\nencountered personal difficulties after being ridiculed \r\nduring service for his mistake with regard to the depth \r\ncharges.  The Board finds that the verification of the \r\nveteran's service aboard ship combined with his documented \r\nemotional problems at that time lend credibility to the \r\nveteran's alleged stressors, particularly the one involving \r\nthe depth charges.  Accordingly, the Board finds that there \r\nis supporting evidence with regard to the veteran's stressor \r\ninvolving the depth charges.  As such, the Board finds that \r\nthe evidence is sufficient to provide supporting evidence of \r\nthe actual occurrence of the veteran's aforementioned alleged \r\nstressor.  \r\n\r\nThus, the occurrence of a stressor has been corroborated.  As \r\nsuch, the pertinent regulation and the Cohen case require an \r\nevaluation with regard to whether or not the veteran has a \r\nclear diagnosis of PTSD and whether there is a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence between current \r\nsymptomatology and the inservice stressor.  That is, if a \r\nmedical examiner diagnoses PTSD, that diagnosis must be based \r\non the confirmed stressor.  \r\n\r\nIn the Cohen case, the Court noted that under 38 C.F.R. � \r\n3.304(f), a current medical diagnosis of PTSD must be an \r\n\"unequivocal\" one.  The Court further explained that a PTSD \r\ndiagnosis by a mental health professional must be presumed to \r\nhave been made in accordance with Diagnostic and Statistical \r\nManual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria.  In other words, a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD by a mental health examiner will be \r\npresumed to be in accordance with DSM criteria as to adequacy \r\nof symptomatology and sufficiency of stressor.  \r\n\r\nIn discussing the sufficiency of a stressor to support a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD, the Court pointed out that under the DSM-\r\nIII-R a psychologically traumatic event(s) must be shown to \r\nhave had the potential of evoking significant symptoms of \r\ndistress in almost everyone.  However, the Court further \r\nnoted that under DSM -IV a subjective test had been adopted.  \r\nSpecifically, in order for a stressor to sufficiently support \r\na diagnosis of PTSD: (1) a person must have been exposed to a \r\ntraumatic event in which the person experienced, witnessed, \r\nor was confronted with an event that involved actual or \r\nthreatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the \r\nphysical integrity of self or others; and (2) the person's \r\nresponse involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror.  The \r\nCourt explained that DSM-IV's \"stressor sufficiency\" \r\nrequirements involved medical questions requiring examination \r\nand assessment by a mental-health professional.  \r\n\r\nAt this point, the Board notes that the pertinent regulation \r\nand the Cohen case do not require that the veteran \r\nexclusively have PTSD.  The veteran may well have more than \r\none psychiatric diagnosis.  Rather, the Board must determine \r\nif he currently has PTSD due to the confirmed stressor.  As \r\npreviously noted, the veteran has been diagnosed as having \r\nPTSD with depression which resulted due to his stressor \r\ninvolving the depth charges.  Although there are conflicting \r\ndiagnoses, the weight of the medical evidence is in the \r\nveteran's favor.  \r\n\r\nIn sum, the weight of the medical evidence attributes the \r\ndevelopment of PTSD with depression to the confirmed \r\nstressor.  The Board finds that there is a clear diagnosis of \r\nPTSD with depression as well as a link, established by \r\nmedical evidence between current symptomatology and the \r\ninservice stressor.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, the evidence shows that the veteran has a clear \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD with depression, that the veteran was \r\nexposed to a stressor during service, and that the medical \r\nevidence shows that the veteran's PTSD with depression was \r\ndue to his exposure to that stressor during service.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, entitlement to service connection for PTSD with \r\ndepression is warranted.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107(b) (West \r\n1991); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tMember, Board of Veterans' Appeals\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"5bec3adb8102470b4a111822","name":"9932109.txt","plainText":"Citation Nr: 9932109\t\r\nDecision Date: 11/12/99    Archive Date: 11/19/99\r\n\r\nDOCKET NO.  97-27 159A\t)\tDATE\r\n\t)\r\n\t)\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Houston, \r\nTexas\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric \r\ndisability, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nAppellant represented by:\tDisabled American Veterans\r\n\r\n\r\nWITNESS AT HEARING ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nAppellant\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nK. R. McCormack, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active military service in the United States \r\nMarine Corps from March 1966 to April 1969.  Service in \r\nVietnam is indicated by the evidence of record.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\nfrom a February 1997 rating decision of the Department of \r\nVeterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in Houston, Texas (the \r\nRO) which denied the veteran's claim of entitlement to \r\nservice connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nThis matter was previously before the Board in November 1998, \r\nat which time it was remanded for further development of the \r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Board's Prior Remand\r\n\r\nIn its November 1998 remand, the Board noted that the \r\nveteran's service medical records showed an impression of \r\nanxiety in April 1967.  It also noted that his December 1996 \r\nVA psychiatric examination report showed a diagnosis of \r\nanxiety disorder, not otherwise specified, with PTSD \r\nsymptoms.  Based on the foregoing, the Board indicated that \r\nthat the possibility of service connection for an anxiety \r\ndisorder should be developed on appeal.\r\n\r\nThe Board directed the RO to schedule the veteran for a VA \r\npsychiatric examination in order to identify whether he had \r\nPTSD or any other psychiatric disorder.  The RO was to \r\ninstruct the VA psychiatrist to render an opinion as to \r\nwhether any psychiatric disorder found was related to the \r\nveteran's military service, to include the entries in 1966 \r\nand 1967 which referred to functional headache, \r\nhypochondriacal symptoms and anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe Board also directed the RO to readjudicate the issue of \r\nentitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric \r\ndisability, to include PTSD.  The RO was  instructed that if \r\nthe benefit sought on appeal was not granted, the RO should \r\nissue a Supplemental Statement of the Case and provide the \r\nveteran and his representative an opportunity to respond.\r\n\r\nThe RO's Subsequent Actions\r\n\r\nIn this case, the Board observes that the RO did not fully \r\ncomply with the directives outlined within the remand of \r\nNovember 1998.  \r\n\r\nFirst, the RO did not schedule the veteran for a VA \r\npsychiatric examination.  It appears that because the RO \r\nfound that evidence received since the November 1998 remand \r\ndid not verify the veteran's claimed PTSD stressors, there \r\nwas no need to schedule him for another VA psychiatric \r\nexamination.  However, in so doing, the RO did not fully \r\ndevelop the issue service connection for an acquired \r\npsychiatric disability, which may potentially include other \r\ndiagnoses.\r\n\r\nSecond, notwithstanding the Board's references to an anxiety \r\ndisorder, the RO did not readjudicate the issue of \r\nentitlement to service connection for any acquired \r\npsychiatric disability but instead limited its inquiry to \r\nPTSD.  \r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, the claim must be remanded to the RO.  \r\nThe United States Court of Veterans Appeals (Court) has \r\nstated that compliance by the Board or the RO is neither \r\noptional nor discretionary.  When the remand orders of the \r\nBoard or the Court are not complied with, the Board errs as a \r\nmatter of law when it fails to ensure compliance, and a \r\nfurther remand will be mandated.  Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. \r\nApp. 268 (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this case is REMANDED to the RO for the \r\nfollowing action:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should contact the veteran to \r\nobtain the names and addresses of any \r\nprivate or VA health care providers who \r\nhave recently treated him for a \r\npsychiatric disorder.  After securing any \r\nnecessary releases, the RO should obtain \r\ncomplete records (which are not already \r\nof record) of any such treatment and \r\nassociate them with the claims folder.\r\n\r\n2.  The RO should then arrange for the \r\nveteran to be examined by a VA \r\npsychiatrist.  The veteran's claims \r\nfolder and a copy of this remand must be \r\nmade available to and reviewed by the \r\nexaminer.  The RO should instruct the \r\nexaminer to identify any psychiatric \r\ndisorder found to be present and render \r\nan opinion as to whether such disorder is \r\nrelated to the veteran's military \r\nservice, to include the entries in 1966 \r\nand 1967 which referred to functional \r\nheadache, hypochondriacal symptoms and \r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nThe report of examination should include \r\na complete rationale for all opinions \r\nexpressed.  All necessary special testing \r\nshould be accomplished.  The report of \r\nthe examination should be associated with \r\nthe veteran's claims folder.\r\n\r\n3.  Following completion of the \r\nforegoing, the RO must review the claims \r\nfolder and ensure that all of the above \r\nforegoing development has been \r\naccomplished.  The RO should then \r\nreadjudicate the issue of service \r\nconnection for an acquired psychiatric \r\ndisability.\r\n\r\nIf the benefit sought on appeal is not granted, the RO should \r\nissue a supplemental statement of the case and provide the \r\nveteran, and his representative, an opportunity to respond.  \r\nThen, the case should be returned to the Board for further \r\nappellate consideration.\r\n\r\nWhile this case is in remand status, the veteran is free to \r\nsubmit additional evidence and argument on the question at \r\nissue.  See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 141 \r\n(1992).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment by the RO.  \r\nThe law requires that all claims that are remanded by the \r\nBoard or by the Court for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee The Veterans' Benefits Improvements Act of 1994, Pub.

Werner, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from July 1968 to July \r\n1970.  The veteran also had a subsequent period of unverified \r\nservice in a reserve component.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) following an October 1996 decision of the Buffalo, \r\nNew York, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) which denied a claim of service connection for \r\nPTSD.  However, this was not the first time a claim of \r\nservice connection for PTSD had been denied by the RO.  \r\nPreviously, in July 1994, the RO denied service connection \r\nfor PTSD and two other psychiatric disorders.  The veteran \r\ninitiated no appeal and the 1994 decision consequently became \r\nfinal.  38 C.F.R. � 20.1103 (1994).\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the RO, in its October 1996 decision, \r\ndid not specifically address the question of whether new and \r\nmaterial evidence sufficient to reopen the claim had been \r\npresented since the July 1994 decision.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5108 \r\n(West 1991); 38 C.F.R. � 3.156 (1999).  Nevertheless, the \r\nUnited States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (known as \r\nthe United States Court of Veterans Appeals prior to March 1, \r\n1999) (Court) has held that, in a matter such as this, the \r\nBoard has a duty to consider the issue of whether new and \r\nmaterial evidence has been submitted to reopen the claim, \r\nregardless of the RO's actions.  See Barnett v. Brown, \r\n8 Vet. App. 1 (1995).  Therefore, the first issue that now \r\nmust be addressed is whether the claim ought to be reopened.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5108 (West 1991).  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Service connection for PTSD was denied by the RO in July \r\n1994 and no appeal ensued.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Evidence obtained in connection with the veteran's \r\nattempt to reopen his claim includes VA treatment records \r\nthat include a diagnosis of PTSD as a result of the veteran's \r\nexperiences in the Republic of Vietnam, information that was \r\nnot previously available in July 1994.\r\n\r\n3.  The veteran has PTSD that is, at least in part, \r\nattributable to a stressful experience during military \r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\n1.  New and material evidence to reopen a previously denied \r\nclaim of service connection for PTSD has been submitted; the \r\nclaim of service connection is reopened.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n�� 1110, 5108, 7105 (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.156, 3.303, \r\n3.304 (1999).\r\n\r\n2.  The veteran has PTSD which is the result of disease or \r\ninjury incurred during active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n�� 1110, 5107 (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 \r\n(1999).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that he has PTSD as a result of his \r\nexperiences in the Republic of Vietnam as a combat engineer.  \r\nHowever, the veteran's current claim of service connection \r\nfor PTSD is not his first such claim.  In July 1994, the RO \r\ndenied the veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD \r\nbecause the record did not contain a diagnosis of PTSD.  No \r\nappeal was taken from this action and it became final.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 20.1103 (1994).  As a result, the veteran's \r\ncurrent claim of service connection may now be considered on \r\nthe merits only if new and material evidence has been \r\nsubmitted since the time of the last final decision.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \r\n\r\n�� 5108, 7104 (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. ��  3.156, 20.1105 \r\n(1999); Manio v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 140, 145 (1991); \r\nEvans v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 273 (1996).  (For the purpose of \r\ndetermining whether new and material evidence has been \r\nsubmitted, the credibility of the evidence is to be presumed.  \r\nJustus v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 510, 513 (1992).)\r\n\r\n\"New and material evidence\" is defined by regulation as \r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nNew and material evidence means evidence \r\nnot previously submitted to agency \r\ndecision makers which bears directly and \r\nsubstantially upon the specific matter \r\nunder consideration, which is neither \r\ncumulative nor redundant, and which by \r\nitself or in connection with evidence \r\npreviously assembled is so significant \r\nthat it must be considered in order to \r\nfairly decide the merits of the claim.  \r\n\r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.156(a) (1999); see also Hodge v. West, 155 F.3d \r\n1356 (Fed.Cir. 1998).\r\n\r\nThe Court, in Elkins v. West, 12 Vet. App. 209 (1999) (en \r\nbanc), recently determined that a three-step approach must be \r\nfollowed in claims to reopen.  See also Winters v. West, \r\n12 Vet. App. 203 (1999) (en banc).  Under this three-step \r\napproach to claims to reopen, VA must first determine whether \r\nnew and material evidence has been presented under 38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.156(a).  If new and material evidence has been presented, \r\nit must be determined whether, based upon all of the evidence \r\nand presuming its credibility, the claim as reopened is well \r\ngrounded pursuant to 38 U.S.C. � 5107(a).  Third, if the \r\nclaim is well grounded, then VA may proceed to evaluate the \r\nmerits of the claim, but only after ensuring that the duty to \r\nassist under 38 U.S.C. � 5107(a) has been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe evidence obtained in connection with the veteran's \r\nattempt to reopen his claim, since the last final denial, \r\nincludes VA treatment records and a VA examination report \r\nthat include a diagnosis of PTSD as a result of his alleged \r\nexperiences in the Republic of Vietnam.  See VA treatment \r\nrecords dated in October 1995, January 1996, May 1996, July \r\n1996, August 1996, November 1996, March 1997, June 1997, \r\nFebruary 1998 and VA examination report dated in October \r\n1997.  The Board notes that the foregoing records contain, \r\nfor the first time, a confirmed diagnosis of PTSD.  The Board \r\nconsequently finds that the evidence received subsequent to \r\nthe July 1994 RO denial is new and material as defined by \r\nregulation.  38 C.F.R. �� 3.156(a).  In other words, it bears \r\ndirectly and substantially upon the issue at hand, and is \r\nneither duplicative nor cumulative.  Given that a post-\r\nservice diagnosis of PTSD was not previously available, this \r\nnewly received evidence is so significant that it must be \r\nconsidered in order to decide fairly the merits of the \r\nunderlying claim.  Id.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that \r\nthe veteran has submitted new and material evidence to reopen \r\nhis claim of service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nBecause new and material evidence has been presented under \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.156(a), the Board must consider anew the merits \r\nof the underlying claim of service connection.  The Board \r\nnotes that, in order to grant service connection for PTSD, \r\nthere must be medical evidence establishing a diagnosis of \r\nthe condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) (1999), \r\ncredible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service \r\nstressor actually occurred, and a link, established by \r\nmedical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service \r\nstressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1999).  \r\n\r\nThe Court has addressed these requirements and has held that \r\nthe evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a \r\nrecognizable stressor during service will vary, depending on \r\nwhether or not the veteran was engaged in combat with the \r\nenemy.  Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91 (1993), citing Hayes \r\nv. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60 (1993), Hamilton v. Derwinski, \r\n2 Vet. App. 671 (1992), (appeal dismissed on other grounds, \r\n4 Vet. App. 528 (1993)). \r\n\r\nInitially, the Board notes that, the veteran, through both \r\nwritten statements to the RO (from himself and his wife) and \r\nstatements at VA examinations, reported that his PTSD was \r\nbrought about by, among other things, having a friend of his \r\n(from either California or Texas) killed while on guard duty \r\nin January 1969, or killed in January 1969 when his base was \r\noverrun during the Tet Offensive, or killed after he had been \r\ntransferred to another unit.  See VA examination reports \r\ndated in September 1996 and October 1997 and statements in \r\nsupport of claim dated in April 1994, January 1997, and May \r\n1997.\r\n\r\nAvailable treatment records show that the veteran was \r\ndiagnosed with PTSD in August and October 1995.  See August \r\nand October 1995 VA treatment records.  (The Board notes that \r\nan earlier November 1993 treatment record from Elmira show \r\nthat the veteran claimed to have been diagnosed with PTSD \r\nduring an earlier admission in 1985.  Moreover, this \r\nadmitting record shows, under the heading \"Admitting \r\nDiagnosis,\" rule-out PTSD.  However, Elmira treatment \r\nrecords, for periods of hospitalizations from June 1985 to \r\nJuly 1985 and from November 1993 to December 1993, did not \r\ninclude a diagnosis of PTSD.)  Subsequent to October 1995, VA \r\ntreatment records show his complaints and/or treatment for \r\nintrusive thoughts and dreams of his combat experience in the \r\nRepublic of Vietnam, as well as a diagnosis of PTSD.  See VA \r\ntreatment records dated in January 1996, May 1996, July 1996, \r\nAugust 1996, October 1996, November 1996, March 1997, June \r\n1997, February 1998, March 1998, and May 1998.  The Board \r\nnotes that the record on appeal contains a January 1994 VA \r\ntreatment record that ruled out PTSD, a December 1996 \r\ntreatment record that reported only a history of PTSD, and \r\ntreatment records that show his complaints, diagnoses, and/or \r\ntreatment for a schizoaffective disorder.  However, the \r\nforegoing VA record also continued to carry a diagnosis of \r\nPTSD.  Id.\r\n\r\nIn addition, at an October 1997 VA examination, after the \r\nveteran had discussed his Vietnam experiences (i.e., having \r\nengaged in firefights, being wounded by shrapnel, having a \r\nfriend killed, being on a convoy that was ambushed, and \r\nseeing people killed), the examiner noted that he had read \r\nthe claims file and formed an opinion that the veteran \r\nsuffered from \"schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type with \r\n\r\ncomorbidity of [PTSD] resulting from the combat experience.\"  \r\nFurthermore, the Board notes that a February 1998 VA \r\ntreatment record characterized the veteran's psychiatric \r\ndisorder as \"combat-related PTSD.\" \r\n\r\nAs noted above, the evidence of record includes a diagnosis \r\nof PTSD by medical personnel and statements from the veteran \r\nto the effect that he was exposed to severe stressors in \r\nservice, including having a friend killed.  Additionally, the \r\nevidence of record includes medical opinions that \r\nspecifically relate his PTSD to the foregoing in-service \r\nexperience.  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  Under \r\nthese circumstances, the Board finds that the veteran's claim \r\nis well grounded within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107 \r\n(West 1991).  The Board is also satisfied that, with \r\nreasonable doubt resolved in the veteran's favor, the \r\nevidence supports a grant of service connection.\r\n\r\nAs for whether evidence sufficient to corroborate the \r\nveteran's story of in-service stressors has been submitted, \r\nthe Board notes that service personnel records show that the \r\nveteran served in the Republic of Vietnam with a combat \r\nengineer unit (27th Engineering Battalion) from December 1968 \r\nto November 1969.  His military occupation was as a combat \r\nengineer, and his awards and decorations included the \r\nNational Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal with \r\nthree Bronze Service Stars, and the Republic of Vietnam \r\nCampaign Medal.  In addition, a December 1968 letter from the \r\nveteran's commander shows that the veteran was assigned to \r\nBravo Company, 27th Engineering Battalion (combat), and his \r\nCompany was stationed 12 miles south of the city of Hue, \r\nRepublic of Vietnam.\r\n\r\nThe veteran has submitted copies of selected pages from the \r\n1968 to 1969 yearbook for the 27th Engineering Battalion.  \r\nThis yearbook contained a picture of the veteran and the \r\nfriend who was reportedly killed.  Moreover, August 1996 \r\ncorrespondence from the U.S. Armed Services Center for \r\nResearch of Unit Records (USASCRUR) indicates that the \r\nindividual reported as killed by the veteran had in fact been \r\nkilled in action in June 1969.  Specifically, this individual \r\nwas killed as a result of a \r\n\r\nrocket-propelled grenade attack while serving with the 25th \r\nInfantry Division in the Republic of Vietnam.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the yearbook and service records provide \r\nsupport for the veteran's recitation of events:  having a \r\nfriend with whom he served killed in action.  While the \r\nveteran gave some inconsistent statements as to the details \r\nconcerning the incident in question, these inconsistencies \r\nare not so glaring for the Board to disregard his claim.  \r\nMoreover, the Court held in Suozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307 \r\n(1997), that corroboration of every detail is not required to \r\nsatisfy the � 3.304(f) requirement that there be credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed stressor actually \r\noccurred.  Accordingly, the Board finds that, in the current \r\nappeal, as in Suozzi, supra, the evidence substantiates a \r\nversion of events during service which, when viewed most \r\nfavorably to the veteran, supports his account of what \r\nhappened.  The yearbook and service records are independent \r\ndescriptions of a significant part of the veteran's version \r\nof events.  In other words, it corroborates the veteran's \r\naccount of what happened even though it does not corroborate \r\nall, or even most, of the details of the event.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is significant that there is no evidence in \r\nthe claims file that directly contradicts the opinion that \r\nthe veteran's PTSD was, at least in part, caused by this same \r\nin-service event.  Although many treatment reports are of \r\nrecord which do not show a diagnosis of PTSD, they do not \r\naffirmatively indicate that he does not experience this \r\ndisability.  Given that the October 1997 evaluation report \r\nshowing PTSD reflected extensive examination and testing, \r\ngiven that examiners who diagnose PTSD must find that the \r\ntraumatic event is being re-experienced in some way, and \r\nbecause the examiners in this case appear to rely on the \r\nexistence of the claimed in-service event in reaching the \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD, the Board finds that the evidence is in \r\nrelative equipoise on this point.  With application of the \r\nbenefit-of-the-doubt doctrine, a grant of service connection \r\nis warranted.  Colette v. Brown, 82 F.2d 389 (Fed. Cir. \r\n1996); Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet.

E. French, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from January 1965 to \r\nNovember 1967.  \r\n\r\nThis appeal arises before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) from a November 1997 rating decision of the Salt Lake \r\nCity, Utah, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of \r\nVeterans Affairs (VA), in which service connection was denied \r\nfor a cardiac condition claimed as secondary to service-\r\nconnected PTSD.  In a January 1998 statement of the case, \r\nthis issue was framed as entitlement to service connection \r\nfor arrhythmia as secondary to medication prescribed for \r\nservice-connected PTSD.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The evidence shows that the veteran continued to \r\nexperience arrhythmia and associated symptomatology (such as \r\npalpitations and chest pain) well after Nardil had been \r\ndiscontinued as treatment for his service-connected PTSD.  \r\n\r\n2.  In the opinion of the VA examiner, the etiology of the \r\nveteran's arrhythmia is unclear, and there is no medical or \r\nevidence which suggests an etiological relationship between \r\nNardil and the intermittent atrial arrhythmia from which the \r\nveteran currently suffers.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the available evidence weighs against a \r\nfinding that the veteran's currently manifested arrhythmia is \r\nproximately due to or the result of medication prescribed as \r\ntreatment for PTSD.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110, 1131, 5107 (West \r\n1991 & Supp. 1999); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.310 (1999).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccording to 38 U.S.C.A. � 1110, 1131 (West 1991 & Supp. \r\n1999), service connection may be granted for a disability if \r\nit is shown that the veteran suffers from a disease or injury \r\nincurred in or aggravated by service.  In addition, service \r\nconnection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after \r\ndischarge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent \r\nto service, establishes that the disease was incurred in \r\nservice.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d) (1999).  \r\n\r\nA disability which is proximately due to or the result of a \r\nservice-connected disease or injury shall be service \r\nconnected.  When service-connection is thus established for a \r\nsecondary condition, the secondary condition shall be \r\nconsidered a part of the original condition.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.310 (1999).  \r\n\r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 1151 (West 1991) provides that a veteran who \r\nhas been injured as the result of VA medical or surgical \r\ntreatment, and not as a result of the veteran's own willful \r\nmisconduct, shall be awarded compensation if that injury \r\nresults in additional disability, in the same manner as if \r\nsuch disability were service-connected.\r\n\r\nEvidence and Background\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that he developed arrhythmia after \r\ntaking Nardil, a medication which was prescribed by his VA \r\nphysicians as treatment for PTSD, which was established as \r\nservice-connected in 1997.   \r\n\r\nVA treatment records and private medical reports indicate \r\nthat numerous medications, including anti-depressants, have \r\nbeen prescribed for the veteran as treatment of psychiatric \r\ndiagnoses such as depression and PTSD.  These records suggest \r\nthat his medications were switched frequently due to his \r\ncomplaints of intolerable side effects.  Prescription of \r\nNardil is first shown in October 1993, at which time \r\nmedication dispensation records indicate that that an \"MAO\" \r\nwould be tried based on the veteran's history.  In November \r\n1993, the dosage of Nardil was noted to be two 15 mg. doses \r\ntaken at bedtime, followed by three 15 mg. doses at bedtime \r\nafter 7 days.  In December 1993, the veteran complained of \r\ntachycardia.  \r\n\r\nIn January 1994, he indicated that he felt \"lousy\" and he \r\ncomplained of missing beats, chest aching, headaches, and \r\nshortness of breath.  At this time, Nardil was stopped the \r\nveteran's medication was changed.  A VA medical certificate \r\nshows that in January 1994, he sought treatment for \r\npalpitations and low blood pressure.  It was noted that he \r\nhad started taking an MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor) in \r\nNovember for depression, at which time the palpitations had \r\nstarted.  He reported that since being off of the Nardil for \r\ntwo weeks, he experienced almost hourly palpitations \r\nassociated with shortness of breath and occasional chest \r\nburning.  The report shows a diagnostic impression of \r\nparoxysmal tachycardia, related to starting MAOI, now off.  \r\n\r\nIn February 1994, the veteran underwent extensive cardiac \r\nevaluation.  A holter monitor report (dated February 8, 1994) \r\nshows an interpretation of sinus rhythm with frequent atrial \r\nectopy and short runs of atrial tachycardia.  It was noted \r\nthat complaints of palpitations and shortness of breath were \r\nnot consistently related to atrial ectopy.  The report of a \r\nFebruary 24, 1994 exercise tolerance test shows that resting \r\nand exercise arrhythmia was present consisting of \"PAD's,\" \r\ncouplets, and short bursts of supraventricular tachycardia.  \r\nAdditional medications are shown to include Paxil (March \r\n1994), Doxepin (April 1994), and Divalproex (July 1994).  \r\n\r\nIn November 1994, it was noted that the veteran was currently \r\nhospitalized by VA for treatment for various diagnoses, \r\nincluding PTSD and major depression.  Additional diagnoses \r\nincluded arteriosclerotic heart disease with lower extremity \r\nclaudication and peripheral vascular disease.  Since \r\nadmission, he had been noted to have occasional irregular \r\nrhythm with decreased heart rates on several occasions, \r\nalthough EKG's had not noted arrhthymia and he had denied \r\nsymptoms of episodes of arrhythmia.  It was noted that he had \r\na history of arrhythmia starting in January 1994 while he was \r\non Nardil (MAOI), and that 2 weeks after discontinuing that \r\nmedication he still had symptoms of palpitations and pounding \r\nin the chest.  An assessment of peripheral vascular disease \r\nwith history of benign dysrhythmia, now with intermittent \r\nasymptomatic arrhythmia, was given.  It was noted that \r\nmedications included Clonidine, Diphenhydramine, Divalproex, \r\nMaalox, and Acetaminophen.  \r\n\r\nIn February 1995, the veteran complained that Effexor made \r\nhis heart race.  A cardiac consultation report, dated \r\nFebruary 9, 1995, shows that the veteran had been referred \r\nregarding an irregular rhythm.  The veteran reported \r\n\"skipped beats\" every now and then and he denied prolonged \r\nperiods of palpitations.  He did not report any dizziness or \r\nsyncope, and he denied other cardiopulmonary symptoms such as \r\nchest pain and shortness of breath.  It was noted that he \r\nseemed to think that since being taking off of antidepressant \r\ntherapy one month before the frequency of the extra beats had \r\ndiminished.  The report shows an assessment of gentleman with \r\npalpitations caused by frequent \"PAD's.\"  It was noted that \r\ntwo previous Holter monitor evaluations had failed to show a \r\nconsistent relationship between his symptoms and arrhythmia, \r\nand there could be a component of anxiety reaction to his \r\nsymptoms.  In any case, the veteran was reassured that the \r\nnature of his arrhythmia was benign.  \r\n\r\nVA medication records show a July 1997 notation to the effect \r\nthat the veteran had been started on Metoprolol for \r\narrhythmia and it was helping.  \r\n\r\nOn his VA Form 9 (substantive appeal), received in February \r\n1998, the veteran indicated his belief that the psychiatric \r\noutpatient clinic had prescribed a medication (MAO inhibitor \r\n\"Nardil\") which caused an arrhythmia where none had existed \r\npreviously.  He also stated that he was currently taking a \r\n\"beta blocker\" (metapropyl tartrate) to relieve symptoms \r\nincluding a burning sensation and aching feeling caused by \r\narrhythmia.  \r\n\r\nIn May 1998, the veteran was afforded a VA compensation and \r\npension examination for the purpose of determining the \r\netiology of his currently manifested arrhythmia.  On the \r\nexamination report, the examiner discussed the pertinent \r\ncardiac history, apparently as reported by the veteran and as \r\nfound in documentation contained in the claims folder.  \r\nCardiovascular examination was essentially normal, with \r\nregular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S1, normal aortic \r\npulsation, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The examiner \r\nprovided an impression of intermittent atrial arrhythmia.  \r\n\r\nThe VA examiner commented that although this arrhythmia was \r\nbenign, the symptoms of palpitations, shortness of breath, \r\nand worsening anxiety may be caused or worsened as a result.  \r\nIt was further noted that the etiology of the arrhythmia was \r\nunclear, and although the veteran felt that the medication \r\nNardil was responsible for precipitating his arrhythmia, \r\nHolter monitors have shown that the condition persists \r\ndespite being taken off this medication.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nUpon review of the record, the Board has concluded that the \r\npreponderance of the available evidence weighs against a \r\nfinding that the veteran's currently manifested arrhythmia is \r\nproximately due to or the result of medication which was \r\nprescribed as treatment for his service-connected PTSD.  \r\nSpecifically, the record lacks objective evidence which \r\nsuggests that the intermittent atrial arrhythmias from which \r\nthe veteran currently suffers are etiologically related to \r\nNardil which was prescribed for treatment of PTSD for a \r\nperiod of approximately 3 months between October 1993 and \r\nJanuary 1994.  \r\n\r\nThe record shows that although the veteran initially \r\ncomplained of tachycardia while taking Nardil in December \r\n1994, he continued to experience arrhythmia and symptoms of \r\npalpitations and chest pain well after the drug had been \r\ndiscontinued.  According to the 1998 VA examiner, Holter \r\nmonitors show that this condition persists despite the fact \r\nthat he was taken off of Nardil.  Furthermore, the VA \r\nexaminer did not provide an opinion that the currently \r\nmanifested diagnosis of intermittent atrial arrhythmia is \r\nrelated to the prescription of Nardil-rather, the examiner \r\ncharacterized the etiology of this disorder as unclear.  In \r\nthe Board's view, therefore, there is no evidence to suggest \r\na positive etiological relationship between the use of Nardil \r\nas treatment for PTSD and the subsequent development of an \r\narrhythmia.  \r\n\r\nOn weighing the available evidence, the Board has found that \r\nthere is an absence of medical documentation, to include a \r\nmedical opinion, which provides support or corroboration for \r\nthe veteran's contention that his arrhythmia is related to \r\nthe prescription of Nardil.  As a layman the appellant is not \r\ncompetent to offer opinions on medical causation and, \r\nmoreover, the Board may not accept unsupported lay \r\nspeculation with regard to medical issues.  See Espiritu v. \r\nDerwinski, 2 Vet.App. 482 (1992).  Although the veteran has a \r\nstrong belief that his arrhythmia was caused by Nardil, the \r\nBoard is unwilling to base a grant of service connection \r\nsolely on the veteran's subjective contentions, especially in \r\nlight of the absence of corroborating medical information or \r\nevidence.  \r\n\r\nIn light thereof and upon careful examination of the \r\nevidence, the Board has concluded that the preponderance of \r\nthe evidence is unfavorable to the veteran's claim.  The \r\nBoard also finds that the medical evidence fails to \r\ndemonstrate evidence of additional disability arising from VA \r\nmedical treatment, such that a grant of service connection \r\nwould be warranted under the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. � 1151 \r\n(West 1991 & Supp. 1999).  See also 38 C.F.R. � 3.358 (1999), \r\nand Jones v. West, 12 Vet.App. 460 (1999).  The doctrine of \r\nreasonable doubt has been considered, however, that doctrine \r\nis not for application as the preponderance of the evidence \r\nis unfavorable to the veteran's claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � \r\n5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-56 (1990).  \r\nAccordingly, service connection is denied for arrhythmia \r\nclaimed as secondary to medication prescribed as treatment \r\nfor service-connected PTSD.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection is denied for arrhythmia, claimed as \r\nsecondary to medications prescribed as treatment for service-\r\nconnected PTSD.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tC.

T. Jones, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from January 1965 to \r\nJanuary 1969.\r\n\r\nThis matter initially to the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a February 1994 RO decision which \r\ndenied the veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD.  \r\nIn December 1997 the Board remanded the issue of service \r\nconnection for PTSD and denied a claim for service connection \r\nfor a dental condition.  The case was returned to the Board \r\nin January 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nDuring service, the veteran did not engage in combat, and \r\nthere is no credible supporting evidence that a stressor, \r\nwhich might lead to PTSD, occurred during service.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nClaimed PTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 1110, (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304 \r\n(1998 and 1999).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI. Factual Background\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty in the Marine Corps from \r\nJanuary 1965 to January 1969.  His service personnel records \r\nshow he served in Vietnam from November 1965 to December \r\n1966; his primary duty was that of a field radio operator.  \r\nThe service records disclose no combat decorations or other \r\nevidence of combat.  His service medical records do not \r\nreflect any pertinent abnormalities, and his December 1968 \r\nseparation examination notes a normal psychiatric system.\r\n\r\nOutpatient treatment records from Health Services Associates \r\nshow treatment beginning in 1986 for medical conditions, \r\nespecially hypertension, chest pain, upper respiratory \r\ninfections.  He was seen in April 1991 for complaints of \r\nemotional stress.  He admitted to previous psychiatric care, \r\nincluding a hospital admission 2 years earlier.  He was \r\nreferred to another doctor where he was seen the next day, \r\nwhen it was noted that his 4 year old niece was killed in a \r\nmotor vehicle accident 10 years ago, his father died shortly \r\nthereafter, then a neighbor had a nervous breakdown and hung \r\nhimself, and shortly after that his best friend drowned in an \r\nautomobile accident.  He reported that he was admitted to a \r\nhospital 2 years ago for suicidal ideation, but that he left \r\nafter he found out he was on a mental ward.  Later in April \r\n1991 he reported that he had been in Vietnam, seen much \r\ncombat, and had been jumpy ever since.  He said he went on \r\npatrols, into a few tunnels and saw a lot of friends die.  He \r\nsaid he went to 10 group therapy sessions 3 years earlier.  \r\nThe diagnosis was adjustment disorder with mixed emotional \r\nfeatures.  In June 1991 he complained of nightmares of \r\nVietnam, and the diagnosis was PTSD.  In October 1991 the \r\ndiagnosis was major depression.  \r\n\r\nIn December 1991 the veteran filed a claim for service \r\nconnection for a nervous condition.\r\n\r\nIn the veteran's last visit of record to Health Services \r\nAssociates in February 1992, he said he felt he had PTSD, \r\ndelayed type and indicated he had an appointment with a VA \r\ncounselor.\r\n\r\nVA outpatient treatment records show the veteran was seen in \r\nFebruary 1992 for counseling assessment.  It was reported \r\nthat his issues were subclinical in nature, and that he was \r\nnot a combat veteran, but seemed to have been traumatized by \r\nsome of what he saw in Vietnam, specifically \"grunts\" who \r\nwere receiving medical attention.  It was reported that that \r\nbereavement seemed to be the crux of the issue for the \r\nveteran, and this referred to the death of his niece, his \r\nfather, and a friend in a car accident.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran was admitted to a VA Medical Center (VAMC) in \r\nApril 1992.  It was reported that that he had no direct \r\ncombat.  Following psychological testing in May 1992, the \r\ndiagnostic impression was mixed character style with passive-\r\naggressive avoidant features.  The diagnoses on his May 1992 \r\ndischarge were major depression and PTSD.  \r\n\r\nFurther VA outpatient records show he was seen regularly to \r\ndiscuss life problems through March 1993.\r\n\r\nIn June 1993 correspondence to the RO, the veteran stated \r\nthat his primary stressor occurred in boot camp and that he \r\n\"was always the one beaten by the CO\" (commanding officer).  \r\nHe alleged that he was beaten \"within an inch of his life\" by \r\na sergeant and 2 corporals during boot camp.  He proffered \r\nthe names of those that he accused. \r\n\r\nAn April 1994 statement from a VA physician, Gene Tinelli, \r\nM.D., from a VA chemical dependency clinic, reflects the \r\ndoctor's opinion that the veteran had PTSD, secondary to a \r\nrecruit training experience during which he was publicly \r\nbeaten and humiliated by his drill instructor.  \r\n\r\nAdditional similar statements, including treatment notes, \r\nfrom Dr. Tinelli are of record.  These records and other VA \r\ntreatment records show diagnoses of PTSD.\r\n\r\nAt a July 1994 RO hearing, the veteran related he had PTSD \r\ndue to incidents that took place during boot camp.  \r\nSpecifically, he testified that when he failed to qualify at \r\nthe rifle firing range, his marching instructor placed his \r\nfoot on his groin area and threatened him.  Later that day, \r\nhe said, his instructor beat him and other servicemen who \r\nfailed to qualify at the firing range.  He said that later \r\nthat day when they had returned to the barracks, he and the 7 \r\nor 8 other non-qualifiers were required to drop their pants \r\nand grab their ankles; the insructor then struck their \r\nbuttocks with a broom stick.  He said he was similarly beaten \r\nthe next day.  At the hearing Dr. Tinelli, reported that he \r\nwas trained in the Navy and that the veteran presented \r\nsimilar symptoms as persons he had treated who had been \r\nvictims of sexual abuse.   \r\n\r\nIn a July 1994 statement, [redacted] (a fellow service-\r\nmember of the veteran) related that while he was stationed at \r\nParis Island, he witnessed a preliminary marksman instructor \r\nhit the veteran repeatedly about the buttocks and genital \r\narea with a broom.  Mr. [redacted] reported that he observed a \r\nchange in the veteran after this beating.\r\n\r\nEfforts to verify the veteran's alleged stressors, through \r\nthe service department, have been unsuccessful.  An August \r\n1998 letter from the Headquarters of U.S. Marine Corps, \r\nPersonnel Management Support Branch, specifically indicates \r\nthat anecdotal incidents, although they may be true, are not \r\nresearchable.  Rather these incidents must be reported and \r\ndocumented.  \r\n\r\nOn a May 1998 VA PTSD examination, it was reported that the \r\nveteran's stressor had been a public and humiliating beating \r\nhe had received in Marine boot camp.  The diagnosis was PTSD.  \r\n\r\nIn his latest statement, dated in October 1999, Dr. Tinelli \r\nreiterated his opinion that the veteran had PTSD from \r\nbeatings in service.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tII.  Analysis\r\n\r\nThe veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD is well \r\ngrounded, meaning plausible; the evidence has been properly \r\ndeveloped to the extent possible, and there is no further VA \r\nduty to assist the veteran with his claim.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n� 5107(a); Murphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 78 (1990).  \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 1110; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\nestablishing a clear diagnosis of the condition, credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressors \r\nactually occurred, and a link, established by medical \r\nevidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed \r\nstressors.  If a claimed stressor is related to combat, \r\nservice department evidence that the veteran engaged in \r\ncombat or that the veteran was awarded the Purple Heart, \r\nCombat Infantryman Badge, or similar combat citation will be \r\naccepted, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as \r\nconclusive evidence of a claimed service stressor.  38 C.F.R. \r\n� 3.304(f) (1998).\r\n\r\nThe above regulation was revised on June 18, 1999, effective \r\nMarch 7, 1997, to reflect the Court's holding in Cohen v. \r\nBrown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  The current version of the \r\nregulation provides that service connection for PTSD requires \r\nmedical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with \r\n38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) [i.e., under the criteria of DSM-IV]; a \r\nlink, established by medical evidence, between current \r\nsymptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting \r\nevidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  If \r\nthe evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat \r\nwith the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that \r\ncombat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to \r\nthe contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is \r\nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone \r\nmay establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service \r\nstressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1999). \r\n\r\nDuring the veteran's active duty he had service in Vietnam, \r\nbut service records do not show he engaged in combat.  In \r\nsome early 1990 treatment records, he reported significant \r\ncombat experience, but in later correspondence, testimony, \r\nand treatment records he denies combat.  Also his current \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD is predicated on a claimed stressor \r\nunrelated to combat.  The Board concludes that the veteran \r\ndid not engage in combat.  Therefore his assertions of \r\nservice stressors are not sufficient to establish that they \r\noccurred; rather, his stressors must be established by \r\nservice records or other credible supporting evidence.  \r\n38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) (1998 and 1999); Fossie v. West, 12 \r\nVet.App. 1 (1998); Cohen, supra; Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet.App. \r\n283 (1994). \r\n\r\nThe veteran's claimed stressors include humiliating beatings \r\ninflicted on him by marine instructors in boot camp.  The \r\nveteran's own service records do not mention the stressors, \r\nand the service department recently could not verify the \r\nclaimed stressors.  The veteran has proffered statement from \r\na fellow Marine to verify his stressor.  This statement \r\npresents credibility problems.  It differs in key respects \r\nfrom the veteran's account.  His witness describes a \r\nmarksmanship instructor as the person who beat the veteran, \r\ndescribes the place of the beating as the firing range, and \r\nrelates that the veteran's genital area was brutally \r\nattacked.  In contrast the veteran states the beating was \r\nadministered by the marching instructor (drill instructor) \r\nand that it took place after they returned to the barracks.  \r\nThe veteran also did not mention any brutal attack of the \r\ngenital area and testified that he was only one of a number \r\nof other marines who were beaten.  \r\n\r\nThe discrepancies in the veteran's and the corroborating \r\nstory are not the only basis to question the occurrence of \r\nthe claimed stressor.  The veteran, himself, has given the \r\nBoard reason to question his veracity.  He has given widely \r\nvarying accounts of his exposure or non-exposure to combat, \r\nwhile in Vietnam, and has mentioned other unverified \r\nbeatings, by his CO and by other drill instructors who he \r\nclaims beat him \"within an inch of his life.\"  The alleged \r\nbeatings themselves would constitute criminal acts by a \r\nnumber of commissioned and non-commissioned officers in a \r\nvery disciplined training atmosphere.  Allegations of such \r\ncriminal conduct demand more substantial proof than the \r\ncontradictory reports by the veteran and his fellow soldier.\r\n\r\nFor the above reasons, the Board finds that the veteran has \r\nnot proffered credible supporting evidence that his claimed \r\nservice stressors, which might lead to PTSD, actually \r\noccurred.  Without such stressor evidence, service connection \r\nfor PTSD may not be granted.\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for \r\nservice connection for PTSD.  Thus the benefit-of-the-doubt \r\nrule does not apply, and the claim must be denied.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); Gilbert v.
