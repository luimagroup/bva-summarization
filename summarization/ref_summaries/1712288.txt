Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), and major depressive disorder.
The Veteran had active service from October 1959 to April 1960, November 1961 to August 1962, April 1964 to February 1974.
This appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2010 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Seattle, Washington.
Service personnel records confirm the Veteran service in Vietnam. The experience described by the Veteran involves him witnessing an event that involved actual or threatened death and a threat to the physical integrity of others and is consistent with his service.
Moreover, the described event is consistent with possible conditions of service in Vietnam during the Veteran's time in service. As such, the stressor of "fear of hostile military or terrorist activity" is accepted.
The August 2013 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's current psychiatric symptomatology, including the residuals of PTSD-anxiety disorder NOS, are due to his fear of hostile military or terrorist activity he experienced while serving in Vietnam. The Veteran's VA treatment provider also related the assessed depression to the Veteran's Vietnam experiences.
, the Board finds that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD with anxiety disorder NOS and major depressive disorder in remission, had its onset during service, and therefore, service connection is warranted.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD with anxiety disorder NOS and major depressive disorder in remission, is granted
