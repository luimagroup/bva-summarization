Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The appellant is a veteran who served on active duty from March 1973 to March 1977.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2002 rating decision of the Oakland Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that in pertinent part denied service connection for PTSD.
It is not shown that the veteran had temporary duty (TDY) at Fort Chaffee in May or June 1975, and the veteran's alleged stressor event in service, witnessing the killing of a Vietnamese Refugee in May or June 1975 at Fort Chaffee, is not corroborated.
It is established that the veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD as both VA and private mental health professionals have given him this diagnosis.
Although the veteran and C.F. are competent to testify regarding the veteran having temporary duty at Fort Chaffee, given the absence of any documentation confirming the veteran's presence there and the personnel records indicating that the veteran was at Fort Lewis, the weight of the evidence is against a finding that the veteran was actually stationed at Fort Chaffee.
Additionally, even if it were shown that the veteran was stationed at Fort Chaffee, the only evidence of record indicating that he witnessed a killing there in May or June 1975 is his own lay testimony.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
