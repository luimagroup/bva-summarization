Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include a bipolar disorder with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) traits or alternatively PTSD.
The appellant served on active duty from July 1968 to January 1969, and from June 1969 to October 1970.
This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) on appeal from an August 2003 rating decision of the Columbia, South Carolina, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.
There is no indication from the claims folder that the RO ever attempted to clarify either diagnosis, or to obtain clarification as to which diagnosis was correct.
Although the RO attempted to collect some information, upon reviewing the claims folder, it appears that additional information should be obtained.
Moreover, even though the veteran's stressors have not been confirmed, numerous VA doctors have diagnosed the veteran has suffering from PTSD.
To ensure that the VA has met its duty to assist the veteran in developing the facts pertinent to his claim, in accordance with the Veterans VCAA, and to ensure full compliance with due process requirements, this case must be REMANDED to the RO for the further development of evidence.
