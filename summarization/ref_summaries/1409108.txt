Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, other than posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including major depression.
The Veteran served on active duty from June 1972 to June 1975.
This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2002 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Appeals (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Reno, Nevada.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.
The Board's August 2012 decision was vacated due to outstanding VA treatment records from the Long Beach VA Medical Center (VAMC) and Las Vegas VAMC.
The most recent records from Law Vegas are dated from November 2007, and the Board cannot point to treatment records from Long Beach.
The parties further suggested that a current VA examination may be needed, based on the complete claims file, to include a review of the above-referenced records.
After any additional records are associated with the claims file, the Veteran should be afforded a VA psychiatric examination to address the nature and likely etiology of any psychiatric disorder other than PTSD.
When the development requested has been completed, the case should be reviewed by the RO/AMC on the basis of additional evidence.
