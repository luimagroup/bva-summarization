Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The appellant had active service from July 1964 to July 1967.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2004 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Indianapolis, Indiana.
The appellant reported a stressor of fear of being killed or injured, indicating a fear of hostile military activity.
In December 2004, a VA psychiatrist found that the claimed stressor was adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD.
As the appellant's stressor is consistent with his service as a light weapons infantryman in Vietnam, the Board finds that the occurrence of an in-service PTSD stressor has been established.
In sum, the appellant has been diagnosed as having PTSD, which was linked by a VA psychiatrist in December 2004 to a stressor of fear of death and injury during his service in Vietnam.
As the stressor is related to fear of hostile military activity and consistent with the conditions of the appellant's service, the occurrence of the stressor has been established.
Resolving all doubt in the appellant's favor, the Board finds that the evidence of record is sufficient to support a finding of service connection for PTSD.
Accordingly, the appellant's claim for service connection for PTSD is granted.
