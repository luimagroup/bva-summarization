Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active service from July 1972 to June 1975.
Currently before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) is a rebuilt claims folder, the veteran's original claims folder having been lost at the RO.
Based on the available evidence of record, it is clear that stressor verification letters sent to the veteran in December 1999 and March 2001 were inadequate.
The Board notes that, in addition to a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder, the veteran has received other psychiatric diagnoses of an avoidant personality disorder, and an adjustment disorder with accompanying depression.
The VA medical records indicate that the diagnosis of PTSD has been linked to the reported sexual assaults in service.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions
The RO should then request from the veteran pertinent information regarding the alleged inservice sexual assaults/rapes reportedly responsible for his currently diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder.
The veteran should then be afforded a VA psychiatric examination in order to determine the nature and etiology of his current psychiatric disorder, to include a post-traumatic stress disorder.
The RO should specify for the examiner the stressor or stressors which it has determined are established by the record, and the examiner is to be instructed that only those events may be considered for the purpose of determining whether exposure to a stressor in service has resulted in PTSD.
