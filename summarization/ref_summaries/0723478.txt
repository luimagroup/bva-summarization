Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active military duty from August 1983 to March 1986.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from April 1993 and September 1993 rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO) in San Juan, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
There is also no evidence of a nexus between the veteran's current psychiatric disability and service.
In sum, while the veteran currently has a psychiatric disability, other than PTSD, it has not been linked to an in- service event.
In this regard, in response to a request by VA, the U. S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) was unable to verify the veteran's claimed stressor.
The preponderance of the evidence is against a finding that the veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. ï¿½ 4.125, and as such, there is no medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, is denied.
