Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder, a personality disorder, and trichotillomania.
The Veteran served on active duty from February 1978 to July 1988
This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2006 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Jackson, Mississippi.
There is no mention of any mental disorder in the Veteran's service entrance examination, and there are no clinical records indicating that the Veteran was treated for or noted to have had a psychiatric disorder prior to her being accepted for active military service in 1978.
The examiner noted that review of the Veteran's record of promotion during service showed good conduct medals in 1981 and 1984.
These records suggested adequate to good performance until at least 1986.
Having found clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran had preexisting depression and PTSD disorders, the Board must show by clear and unmistakable evidence that these conditions were not aggravated by service. The Board is persuaded by the January 2012 VA examiner's conclusion that there is no supporting evidence that the Veteran's experiences in the military had an effect on the course of her psychiatric conditions.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is denied.
