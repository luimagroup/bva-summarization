Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability to include depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance abuse secondary to depression and/or PTSD.
The Veteran served on active duty from September 2005 to November 2009.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2011 RO decision.
The appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).
Since 2010, when the Veteran filed the claim which led to this appeal, he has used at least three different addresses.
There are several indications in the file that the Veteran is not receiving his mail.
In any case, the Veteran has requested a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge via videoconference and he is entitled to one under law.
As above, it is possible that he did not receive notice of the hearing scheduled for August 2016 and the Board is not satisfied that the RO's letter of notification was adequate under the circumstances.
The RO should schedule a videoconference hearing, following all indicated procedures to notify the Veteran and his representative, should he choose to appoint one, of the scheduled date and time.
