Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from November 1968 to April 1971.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) on appeal from a March 1997 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in St. Petersburg, Florida (the RO).
Although the veteran himself contends that he has PTSD, it is now well-established that as a layperson without medical training he is not qualified to render medical opinions regarding the diagnosis of disorders and disabilities, and his opinion is entitled to no weight.
The claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
