Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active military service from February 1953 to December 1954.
In October 2013, the Court granted a joint motion (Joint Motion) of the Veteran and the Secretary of VA, vacated the April 2013 decision, and remanded the matter to the Board for compliance with the instructions in the Joint Motion.
In the October 2013 Joint Motion (JMR), it was noted that during the Veteran's December 1, 2011 hearing he commented that he was in receipt of ongoing treatment for PTSD at the Houma VA Outpatient Clinic.
In April 2013, the record contained records from the Houma VA Outpatient Clinic, but they only covered a period up to 2008.
The indispensable query is not treatment for PTSD, or a diagnosis of PTSD, but the Veteran's stressors in service.
In any event, per the October 2013 Joint Motion, this case must be remanded to allow the Agency of Original Jurisdiction additional opportunity to obtain the Veteran's treatment records from the Houma VA Outpatient Clinic for the period 2008 to the present.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
Then, schedule the Veteran for a comprehensive VA psychiatric examination to obtain a current diagnosis including the severity of the Veteran's PTSD (if any), and to determine the nature and etiology of such diagnosis.
