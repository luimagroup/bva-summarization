Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from August 1964 to August 1968, and from June 1971 to December 1977.
He filed an appeal from the October 1992 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Manchester, New Hampshire, Regional Office (RO), which denied service connection for PTSD.
The examiner concluded that the veteran had recollections of an event in Vietnam during which he legitimately appeared to have felt quite helpless, apparently serving as a basis for the PTSD diagnosis.
the Court noted that it is the distressing event rather than the mere presence in a "combat zone" which may constitute a valid stressor for purposes of supporting a diagnosis of PTSD.
A post service diagnosis of PTSD has been confirmed by VA doctors and the veteran has demonstrated classic symptoms of this mental disease including startle reaction, bad dreams, irritability, anger, anxiety, depression, social isolation and difficulty in working with others.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.
