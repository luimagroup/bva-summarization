Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include a depressive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from June 1963 to September 1966.
This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) on appeal from a May 2011 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Due to the long period between military service and his first complaint of mental health symptoms, and the lack of evidence of treatment for any mental health disorder while in the military, it is the examiner's opinion that it is less likely as not that the Veteran's current unspecified depressive disorder is related to his military service.
His psychiatric condition was clinically evaluated as normal upon separation from service in September 1966.
The earliest post-service medical evidence of treatment for psychiatric symptoms is dated in 2009, which is approximately 42 years after his active duty service.
In addition, he does not cite to any inservice or post-service complaints or findings, other than to note a history of (undated) diagnoses of depression.
The Board has determined that service connection is not warranted for the claimed disability.
The Veteran has been afforded an examination, and he has been determined to not have PTSD, or an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD that is related to his service.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.
