Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from April 1966 to March 1970.
This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 1995 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Louisville, Kentucky.
After reviewing the totality of the medical evidence of record, the Board must conclude that the veteran has failed to meet the first requirement for service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder spelled out in 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).
With respect to the second element necessary for a well- grounded claim for service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder, the veteran's Form DD-214 reveals that his military occupational specialty was that of a disbursing clerk.
The Form DD-214 does not reveal the award of any decorations specific for combat.
Inasmuch as the preponderance of the evidence, as discussed above, is against a finding of a current credible diagnosis of PTSD, his claim for service connection for PTSD does not meet one of the requirements of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is denied.
