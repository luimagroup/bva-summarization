Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active service from May 1952 to April 1954.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a July 2003 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Cleveland, Ohio, that denied the veteran's claim for service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran's service medical records show no complaints of or treatment for PTSD or for injuries that may have been sustained in a jeep accident.
The report of an April 1954 separation examination noted no pertinent defects, diagnoses or significant interval history.
with regard to the claimed jeep accident, the veteran told RO personnel that any information he gave as to that incident was based on what others told him because he had been in a coma at the time. As noted, service medical records do not bear that out.
Thus, as the veteran has failed to produce credible supporting evidence that a claimed in-service stressor actually occurred, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.
