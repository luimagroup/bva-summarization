Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from September 1964 to September 1968.
This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 1992 decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Petersburg, Florida, which denied the veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD.
Although the veteran apparently alleges combat service, and told stories of combat to the psychiatrist at the VA compensation examination in January 1992, there is no probative evidence of combat participation.
The veteran's service records document a potential non-combat stressor; gunshot wounds sustained while riding his motorcycle on authorized liberty in Thailand (residuals of the wounds are service- connected).
Medical evidence of linkage between this event and any clearly diagnosed PTSD would be required for service connection.
In my judgment, a special VA psychiatric examination, by a board of two psychiatrist, is warranted on the question of whether PTSD exists and whether it is linked to a service stressor.
In view of the foregoing, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
