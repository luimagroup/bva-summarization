Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as secondary to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from February 1969 to April 1973.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision by a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
The Veteran's claimed hypertension was not manifested during the Veteran's active service or for many years thereafter, nor is hypertension otherwise related to such service; the Veteran's hypertension is not causally related to nor has it been aggravated by his service-connected PTSD.
The physician stated that the Veteran's high blood pressure is usually controlled with medication, however, his PTSD and the panic and anxiety associated with it makes the high blood pressure hard to control sometimes.
The examiner stated that there were several etiologies for the development of the Veteran's primary hypertension, including: family history, age, and obesity.
The Board also finds that the July 2004 opinion does not sufficiently address whether the Veteran's hypertension is aggravated by his PTSD.
In this case, the Board finds that the most persuasive probative analysis of the decisive medical questions at issue is the December 2008 VA medical opinion, which does not present a basis for finding that the Veteran's hypertension is etiologically related to his active duty service or service-connected PTSD.
The appeal is denied.
