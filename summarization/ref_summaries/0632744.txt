Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active service from April 1965 until May 1970.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) from a December 2002 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO) in No. Little Rock, Arkansas.
The RO also stated that the veteran has not provided the name of the person killed.
The veteran's contention that he was driving a military vehicle that struck and killed a seven-year old Korean girl, his stressor, is unsupported by the objective evidence of record.
Therefore, in the absence of objective evidence to corroborate the veteran's presence as to the event he described, the claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD must be denied.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
