Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active duty service from November 1962 to November 1965.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2004 rating decision by a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
In April 2004, VA sent a letter to the veteran pertaining to his claim for service connection for anxiety/depression.
The Board notes, however, that VA has not provided guidance to the veteran as to how to substantiate a claim for PTSD which entails different legal criteria.
The Board finds VA should contact the veteran to determine if there are any outstanding treatment records and, if so, should take appropriate steps to obtain the evidence identified by the veteran if possible.
