Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from August 1970 to May 1974.
In May 2015, pursuant to a Joint Motion for Remand, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) vacated the Board's decision.
The criteria for an award of service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, have been met.
After a thorough examination, the examiner found it less likely than not that the Veteran's schizoaffective disorder and panic disorder are related to his in-service emotional instability.
He further opined that the medical record strongly suggests that the Veteran was in a prodromal (beginning) state of schizophrenia during service, and that at least one in-service event could reasonably be expected to have exacerbated it.
VA examiners in March 2004 and August 2005 have offered opinions that weigh against the Veteran's claim, and Drs. E.P.A. and R.I.F. have rendered August 2008 and July 2015 opinions that weighs in favor of the claim.
The Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise in this case.
