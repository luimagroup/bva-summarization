Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active service from May 1969 to September 1970.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2000 decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Seattle, Washington.
The veteran's personnel records have been requested and a response received, which includes some records, but records relating to his period of AWOL, Article 15s (2 Article 15s as shown to have been reported by the veteran in a November 1992 VA treatment record and 1 Article 15 as shown to have been reported by the veteran in a December 1995 VA examination), and records relating to his Airborne training have not been received.
VA treatment records from the Seattle VA Medical Center (MC) have been received through November 1996, but not thereafter.
Letters/statements have been received from Bruce Harmon, a private Washington State Mental Health Counselor, but it does not appear that treatment records have been received from Mr. Harmon.
In light of the above, the appeal is REMANDED for the following:
Request copies of records from the Seattle VAMC relating to any psychiatric treatment of the veteran from November 1996 to the present.
Request copies of records from Bruce Harmon, a private Washington State Mental Health Counselor, relating to any psychiatric treatment he has provided the veteran.
Request all of the veteran's service personnel records based on personal trauma ("PIES request code 018," M21-1 MR, IV.ii.1.D.14), including specifically relating to any Article 15s, AWOL from January 10, 1970, to February 3, 1970, and "JUMPS" records relating to airborne training in November and December 1969.
