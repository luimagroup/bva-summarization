On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Winston- Salem, North Carolina.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). [The issue of entitlement to a total disability evaluation based upon individual unemployability due to a service- connected disability (TDIU) will be addressed in a separate decision.]
The veteran served on active duty from February 1976 to January 1978.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 1990 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
Initially, the Board finds that all relevant facts have been properly developed in regard to the veteran's claim, and no further assistance is required in order to comply with the VA's statutory duty to assist him with the development of facts pertinent to his claim.
Such corroborating evidence cannot consist solely of after-the-fact medical evidence containing an opinion as to a causal relationship between PTSD and service.
The Board has first considered the question of whether the veteran has a medical diagnosis of PTSD.
A request for further information in this regard from the headquarters of the United States Marine Corps of the Department of the Navy resulted in a negative response in October 1999.
In a March 2000 lay submission, the veteran provided additional information, including the names of several other commanders and instructors.
The claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
