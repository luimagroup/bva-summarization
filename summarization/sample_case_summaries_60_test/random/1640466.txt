On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1966 to July 1968, including combat service in the Republic of Vietnam.
The Veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD has been recharacterized to include all psychiatric disorders reasonably raised by the record.
Further, the issues of reopening his claim for peripheral neuropathy, and entitlement to a compensable rating for his service-connected bilateral hearing loss, have been raised by the record.
Because the foregoing issues have not been adjudicated by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), the Board does not have jurisdiction over them and they are referred to the AOJ for appropriate action.
The Veteran's PTSD and depressive disorder had its onset in service.
The criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as PTSD and depressive disorder, have been met.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed PTSD and depressive disorder, is granted.
