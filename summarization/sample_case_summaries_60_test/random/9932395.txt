On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Buffalo, New York.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from July 1968 to July 1970.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following an October 1996 decision of the Buffalo, New York, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) which denied a claim of service connection for PTSD.
The veteran has PTSD which is the result of disease or injury incurred during active military service.
Accordingly, the Board concludes that the veteran has submitted new and material evidence to reopen his claim of service connection for PTSD.
Furthermore, the Board notes that a February 1998 VA treatment record characterized the veteran's psychiatric disorder as "combat-related PTSD."
Additionally, the evidence of record includes medical opinions that specifically relate his PTSD to the foregoing in-service experience.
Consequently, the yearbook and service records provide support for the veteran's recitation of events:  having a friend with whom he served killed in action.
Service connection for PTSD is granted.
