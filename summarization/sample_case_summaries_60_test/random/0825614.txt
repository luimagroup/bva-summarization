On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Los Angeles, California.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran's DD-214 discharge report indicates that the veteran served a portion of his active duty in Vietnam where he served as a field artillery crewman.
The letter sent to the veteran to inform him of the information and evidence necessary to establish his claim, indicated that his claim was for "post pragmatic syndrome" and "post pramatia syndrome," and  there is no indication veteran was ever sent a stressor identification letter.
