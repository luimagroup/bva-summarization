On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from October 1968 to October 1970.
By tradition and by statute, the benefit of the doubt belongs to the veteran.
In November 1993, he was again examined by the VA psychiatrist who conducted the December 1990 psychiatric examination, but, again, it was noted that "[i]t is our opinion that this veteran's condition and symptoms do not fulfill [the] criteria for a diagnosis of P[TSD] and that his correct psychiatric diagnosis should be that of Dysthymia."
This psychiatrist thereafter re-examined the veteran in July 1998, and indicated that "the diagnosis will remain as stated," while the VA psychiatrist who examined the veteran in August 1992 diagnosed once again, in July 1998, a depressive disorder and alcohol abuse, in remission.
For instance, the Board notes that, in May 1990, the veteran had a one-day admission due to complaints of auditory hallucinations, depression, nightmares, insomnia, poor control of his impulses, suicidal ideas, anorexia, and frequent crying.
As noted above, the record shows that the veteran is a combat veteran, who has reported stressful inservice experiences, and he has had multiple hospitalizations in which he has reported symptoms arising from those inservice experiences.
Service connection for PTSD is granted.
