On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Montgomery, Alabama.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1979 to June 1982.
In addition, she had service in the National Guard from September 1984 to September 1985.
As the December 2016 opinion does not clearly address this issue, an additional medical opinion is warranted to determine whether the Veteran's PTSD is proximately due to or aggravated by her service-connected migraines.
If aggravation is found, then the examiner should quantify the degree of such aggravation, if possible.
The appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.
The law requires that all claims remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.
The appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.
