On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Nashville, Tennessee.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from February 1967 to September 1969.
Proper notice from VA must inform the claimant and his representative, if any, prior to the initial unfavorable decision on a claim by the AOJ of any information and any medical or lay evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim;
All relevant, identified, and available evidence has been obtained; specifically, the Veteran's service treatment records and VA examination report are in the file.
Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service.
Service connection may also be granted for chronic disorders, such as psychoses, when manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service.
To make this decision, the Board must consider all the evidence of record and make appropriate determinations of competence, credibility, and weight.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.
