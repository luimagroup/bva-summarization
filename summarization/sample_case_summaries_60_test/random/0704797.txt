On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Houston, Texas.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The appellant had active air service from June 1968 to March 1969, with time lost by reason of being absent without leave (AWOL) from duty in December 1968 and January 1969.
In January 2005, the Board remanded this case.
The in-service stressors claimed by the appellant are not related to military combat with an enemy of the United States of America.
If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
With regard to the first claimed in-service stressor, the appellant has not submitted any supporting evidence, such as an affidavit by an eyewitness or by some other person claiming to have personal knowledge of the appellant's alleged abuse in December 1968 by the military prison guards, nor has he or his representative identified any existing evidence which would tend to support or corroborate the appellant's statements concerning such alleged abuse.
In March 2006, the JSRRC reported to VA that after extensive research, the jeep accident as described by the appellant could not be documented.
Service medical records and post-service medical records have been associated with the claims file and efforts were made to officially confirm the stressors described by the veteran.
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is denied.
