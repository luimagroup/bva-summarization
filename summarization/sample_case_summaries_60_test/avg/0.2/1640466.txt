On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1966 to July 1968, including combat service in the Republic of Vietnam.
The Veteran's PTSD and depressive disorder had its onset in service.
He also reported that "one of the tanks we were working with hit a mine and my [sergeant] and myself pulled the guys out of the tank that caught fire while artillery shells were going off."
The July 1968 separation examination report indicates that the Veteran reported having depression or excessive worry.
The Board finds that the medical evidence of record supports the finding that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms are related to his in-service stressors.
Consequently, the elements necessary to establish service connection for his psychiatric disorder have been met.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed PTSD and depressive disorder, is granted.
