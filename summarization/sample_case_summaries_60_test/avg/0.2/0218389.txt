On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active service from March 1964 to March 1968.
The veteran was sent a letter by the RO in January 2002 which explained, among other things, the VCAA's duty to assist and what evidence was needed to substantiate his service connection claim for PTSD.
The provisional diagnosis was of rule out psychopathological disorders versus anxiety reaction.
The resulting diagnosis was of depression, neurotic type, mild to moderate severity, manifested by what appeared to be some feelings of depression.
During this engagement, the veteran recalled later that he was very scared, that he knew it was over, and that he hoped that he was ready to die.
After being escorted for a good while by four jet fighters, a "sky-hop" dropped napalm and left, leaving the helicopter unable to land, and they were out at sea.
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is denied.
