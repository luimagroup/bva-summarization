On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from October 1968 to October 1970.
When, after consideration of all the evidence of record, there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter or a reasonable doubt arises regarding service origin, the degree of disability or any other point, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.
He acknowledged that at times his behavior became unintelligible to himself and others, since he appeared to behave as if he were still in the war.
In the examiner's opinion, "[t]he result of this evaluation supports the diagnosis of P[TSD]."
It was noted that the veteran had attended a VA PTSD group, and that, in the subscribing physician's opinion, he was "a severely disabled veteran that is unemployable."
He also reported sadness, insomnia and isolation tendencies, and said that he was mad at a helicopter that had flown over his house.
Service connection for PTSD is granted.
