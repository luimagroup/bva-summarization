On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Houston, Texas.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The appellant had active air service from June 1968 to March 1969, with time lost by reason of being absent without leave (AWOL) from duty in December 1968 and January 1969.
If, however, VA determines that the veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy, the veteran's lay testimony, by itself, is not sufficient to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.
In this case, there is no dispute as to whether the appellant's alleged in-service stressors are related to combat.
In written statements to VA and in hearing testimony, the appellant has said that the other jeep rolled over and that the driver or one of the passengers in the other jeep was seriously injured and may have died as a result of injuries in such jeep accident.
In March 2006, the JSRRC reported to VA that after extensive research, the jeep accident as described by the appellant could not be documented.
No supporting evidence whatsoever having been presented or identified, there is no credible evidence that the appellant's second claimed in-service stressor occurred.
Service medical records and post-service medical records have been associated with the claims file and efforts were made to officially confirm the stressors described by the veteran.
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is denied.
