On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Montgomery, Alabama.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1979 to June 1982.
The remand instructions stated that the examiner was to render an opinion as to whether the documented in-service headaches and fainting spells were manifestations of her diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder (to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety).
The Veteran was afforded an additional VA psychiatric evaluation in December 2016.
The examiner noted mental health diagnoses of chronic PTSD with secondary generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder.
In addition, the Veteran, through her representative, has asserted that her PTSD and depression are caused or aggravated by her service connected migraines.
If aggravation is found, then the examiner should quantify the degree of such aggravation, if possible.
The appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.
