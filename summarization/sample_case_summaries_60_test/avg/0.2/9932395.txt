On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Buffalo, New York.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from July 1968 to July 1970.
In July 1994, the RO denied the veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD because the record did not contain a diagnosis of PTSD.
The Board consequently finds that the evidence received subsequent to the July 1994 RO denial is new and material as defined by regulation.
The Board notes that, in order to grant service connection for PTSD, there must be medical evidence establishing a diagnosis of the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. ยง 4.125(a) (1999), credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred, and a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor.
In addition, a December 1968 letter from the veteran's commander shows that the veteran was assigned to Bravo Company, 27th Engineering Battalion (combat), and his Company was stationed 12 miles south of the city of Hue, Republic of Vietnam.
Moreover, August 1996 correspondence from the U.S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records (USASCRUR) indicates that the individual reported as killed by the veteran had in fact been killed in action in June 1969.
Specifically, this individual was killed as a result of a rocket-propelled grenade attack while serving with the 25th Infantry Division in the Republic of Vietnam.
Service connection for PTSD is granted.
