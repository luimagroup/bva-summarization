On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Los Angeles, California.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran's DD-214 discharge report indicates that the veteran served a portion of his active duty in Vietnam where he served as a field artillery crewman.
His VA psychologist reports that the veteran served in Vietnam as a radioman in the 1st Cavalry Division.  (The veteran's service medical records show Vietnam service with C Battery, 2/19th Artillery, 1st Cavalry Division).
However, the veteran's service personnel records are not currently associated with his claims file, and efforts to obtain them should be made.
Additionally, the current record does not reflect any meaningful effort to corroborate the veteran's claimed stressors.
The letter sent to the veteran to inform him of the information and evidence necessary to establish his claim, indicated that his claim was for "post pragmatic syndrome" and "post pramatia syndrome," and  there is no indication veteran was ever sent a stressor identification letter.

Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:
