The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from October 1968 to May 1970.
He stated that he was fearful of sniper attacks, and recalled an incident where he was subject to mortar fire.
Since that time, he asserts that he has experienced symptoms such as nightmares and hypervigilance.
In April 2005, the RO recognized that the Veteran had been diagnosed with PTSD by some treating physicians, but denied the Veteran's claim on the basis that his stressors could not be corroborated unless he could provide more accurate information.
The VA provides VA associated practitioners with the veterans' claims folders in connection with all mental-disorder examinations, including PTSD examinations, who are instructed that a PTSD diagnosis cannot occur without a review of the folder.

The AMC should also take action on the JSRRC recommendation to conduct a search of the morning reports submitted by the 20th Engineering Battalion, in order to confirm whether any attacks occurred on that unit from June through August, 1969.  2.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
