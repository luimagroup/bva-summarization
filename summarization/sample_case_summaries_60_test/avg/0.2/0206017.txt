On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Fort Harrison, Montana.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1957 to March 1961.
When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.
He was diagnosed with passive-aggressive reaction, manifested by increasing tension, difficulty with authority, alleged difficulty restraining hostile impulses and manipulative propensities.
He tended to attribute much of his dysfunction to the accidental shooting incident during his period of military service.
Dr. J.E. initially determined that it was reasonable to conclude from the medical evidence of record that the veteran had a "traumatic incident" when, at age 18, he accidentally shot a fellow soldier and experienced loss of rank, court-martial and transfer; that one year later the veteran was hospitalized with anxiety/depression symptoms when the diagnosis was "stress/accidental shooting" and "passive-aggressive reaction."
Thus, the Board finds that all three elements of 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.304(f) have been satisfied.
Board concludes that service connection is in order for an acquired psychiatric disability, specifically  PTSD.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.
