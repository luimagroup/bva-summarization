On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Houston, Texas.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The appellant had active air service from June 1968 to March 1969, with time lost by reason of being absent without leave (AWOL) from duty in December 1968 and January 1969.
If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
In this case, there is no dispute as to whether the appellant's alleged in-service stressors are related to combat.
In a May 2005 response to a VA request for information, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations reported that no records were found to confirm either incident.
In March 2006, the JSRRC reported to VA that after extensive research, the jeep accident as described by the appellant could not be documented.
No supporting evidence whatsoever having been presented or identified, there is no credible evidence that the appellant's second claimed in-service stressor occurred.
Service medical records and post-service medical records have been associated with the claims file and efforts were made to officially confirm the stressors described by the veteran.
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is denied.
