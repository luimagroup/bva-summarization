On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Montgomery, Alabama.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1979 to June 1982.
The remand instructions stated that the examiner was to render an opinion as to whether the documented in-service headaches and fainting spells were manifestations of her diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder (to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety).
The examiner was also advised to address the medical literature in the October 2016 Appellate Brief suggesting that fainting and headaches can be physical symptoms of PTSD and can occur as a result of exposure to trauma and the Veteran's September 1980 in-service reports of headaches and fainting spells.
The Veteran was afforded an additional VA psychiatric evaluation in December 2016.
In addition, the Veteran, through her representative, has asserted that her PTSD and depression are caused or aggravated by her service connected migraines.
If aggravation is found, then the examiner should quantify the degree of such aggravation, if possible.
The appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.
