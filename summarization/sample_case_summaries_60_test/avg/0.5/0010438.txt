On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from October 1968 to October 1970.
When, after consideration of all the evidence of record, there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter or a reasonable doubt arises regarding service origin, the degree of disability or any other point, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.
The veteran was examined, but it was noted that his thought content dealt mostly with "description of some depressive symptomatology," although the veteran did describe having memories from Vietnam, "becoming rather depressed when he starts thinking about this, unable to sleep, and also ... irritable and sometimes losing control of his impulses."
In the examiner's opinion, "[t]he result of this evaluation supports the diagnosis of P[TSD]."
In addition to the above, the vast majority of the multiple VA psychiatric admissions of the veteran throughout the years have included a diagnosis of PTSD.
It was noted that the veteran had attended a VA PTSD group, and that, in the subscribing physician's opinion, he was "a severely disabled veteran that is unemployable."
Service connection for PTSD is granted.
