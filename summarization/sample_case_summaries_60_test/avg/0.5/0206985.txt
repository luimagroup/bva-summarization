On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Winston- Salem, North Carolina.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). [The issue of entitlement to a total disability evaluation based upon individual unemployability due to a service- connected disability (TDIU) will be addressed in a separate decision.]
The veteran served on active duty from February 1976 to January 1978.
Where, however, the VA determines that the veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy and was not a POW, or the claimed stressor is not related to combat or POW experiences, the veteran's lay statements, by themselves, will not be enough to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.
Such corroborating evidence cannot consist solely of after-the-fact medical evidence containing an opinion as to a causal relationship between PTSD and service.
The Board has first considered the question of whether the veteran has a medical diagnosis of PTSD.
Board observes that he did not have service during a period of war and was not stationed overseas at any time during service.
As such, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
The claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
