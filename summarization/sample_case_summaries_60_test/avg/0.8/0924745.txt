On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Montgomery, Alabama.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

However, insufficient efforts have been made to verify the Veteran's alleged in-service stressors.
In a letter dated August 2008, the JSRRC coordinator made a formal finding that there was a lack of information required to corroborate the Veteran's alleged stressors.

Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
