On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Huntington, West Virginia.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active service from December 1964 to December 1968.
As addressed below, the dispositive issue in this case concerns whether the veteran was exposed to combat and non-combat stressors during his period of service in the Republic of Vietnam.
As addressed below, the Board finds that the unavailability of the 1965 deck logs is largely irrelevant as the version of this non-combat stressor relied upon by the VA examiners in arriving at the veteran's PTSD diagnosis clearly did not happen.
Based upon the above, the Board finds that no reasonable possibility exists that any further assistance would aid the veteran in substantiating his claim.
Thus, the Board finds that no prejudice accrues to the veteran in proceeding to the merits of his claim at this time.
Based upon the above, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence establishes that the veteran was not engaged in combat, and that his allegations of exposure to combat and non-combat stressors are not credible.
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
