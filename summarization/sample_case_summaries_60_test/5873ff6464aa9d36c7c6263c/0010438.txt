On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from October 1968 to October 1970.
If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed stressor.
The veteran was examined, but it was noted that his thought content dealt mostly with "description of some depressive symptomatology," although the veteran did describe having memories from Vietnam, "becoming rather depressed when he starts thinking about this, unable to sleep, and also ... irritable and sometimes losing control of his impulses."
In addition to the above, the vast majority of the multiple VA psychiatric admissions of the veteran throughout the years have included a diagnosis of PTSD.
It was noted that the veteran had attended a VA PTSD group, and that, in the subscribing physician's opinion, he was "a severely disabled veteran that is unemployable."
As clearly shown in the above discussion of the pertinent competent evidence of record, several mental health experts have said that the veteran does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, while other mental health experts, particularly those who have treated the veteran during his multiple psychiatric hospitalizations, have indicated that the veteran indeed suffers from PTSD.
The Board then finds that the evidence as to whether the veteran has PTSD or not is in relative equipoise.
Service connection for PTSD is granted.
