On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Montgomery, Alabama.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The appellant had active service in the Marine Corps from January 1969 to August 1970, as well as subsequent active service in the Army from July 1971 to August 1979.
The medical evidence reflects a diagnosis of PTSD, but there is no credible supporting evidence to verify or corroborate the appellant's alleged stressors during his active military service.
Moreover, a general statement in the veteran's service personnel records that he participated in a particular operation or campaign would not, in itself, establish that he engaged in combat with the enemy because the terms "operation" and "campaign" encompass both combat and non-combat activities.
The claimant's assertions that he engaged in combat with the enemy are not ignored, but are evaluated along with the other evidence of record.
The Board is cognizant of the appellant's own statements to the effect that he experiences symptoms of PTSD that are due to stressors while in service.
After a thorough review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the appellant's claim for service connection for PTSD.
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
