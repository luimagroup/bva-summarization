On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active military service from November 1944 to November 1946.
Although the RO had previously attempted to verify the veteran's alleged stressors through the USASCRUR, its request to the USASCRUR did not adequately identify the veteran's claimed stressors.
If the RO is unable to obtain a copy of any records identified by the veteran, it should so inform the veteran and his representative of this and request them to provide a copy of such records.
An attempt should also be made to obtain any personnel records indicating the veteran's location and duties during the period in question, not already contained in the claims folder.
The RO should then review the file and prepare a summary of the veteran's claimed stressors, to include any additional information received from the veteran concerning his claimed stressors.
This summary, a copy of any stressor statements from the veteran, and a copy of any pertinent personnel records should be sent to the U.S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records (USASCRUR), 7798 Cissna Road, Suite 101, Springfield, Virginia 22150-3197, for verification of the veteran's alleged stressors.
In light of these circumstances, this case is REMANDED to the RO for the following:
