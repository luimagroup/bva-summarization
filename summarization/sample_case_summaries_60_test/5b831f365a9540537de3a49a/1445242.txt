On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Portland, Oregon.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression.
The Veteran served on active duty from May 1967 to August 1968.
The physician diagnosed the Veteran with depressive disorder, not otherwise specified, and concluded that the Veteran did not meet criterion A for PTSD.
In an August 2014 report, a private physician reviewed pertinent evidence in the Veteran's claims file and opined that the in-service stressor involving the assault in the shower was sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran had PTSD due to that in-service stressor.
While the August 2014 private physician opined that the stressor involving the assault in the shower was sufficient and the Veteran has PTSD due to that stressor, that opinion is based on the finding that the Veteran was hypersensitive to stressors.
The examiner should address the June 1968 service medical record showing that the Veteran was treated for angioneurotic edema and recurrent urticaria and prescribed Atarax for nervous problems, the August 2005 VA examiner's opinion that the Veteran's PTSD with secondary depression was related to a traumatic event during active duty, the March 2007 Vet Center opinion that the Veteran's overall military experience may have led to depression, the March 2011 VA physician's conclusion that the Veteran did not meet criterion A for PTSD, and the August 2014 private physician's opinion that the stressor involving the assault in the shower was sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD and the Veteran has PTSD due to that stressor.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:
