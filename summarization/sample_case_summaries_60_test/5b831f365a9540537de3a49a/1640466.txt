On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1966 to July 1968, including combat service in the Republic of Vietnam.
The Veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD has been recharacterized to include all psychiatric disorders reasonably raised by the record.
The Veteran's PTSD and depressive disorder had its onset in service.
She also indicated that the Veteran has consistently reported that symptoms associated with PTSD and depressive disorder began during his service and have caused him significant dysfunction throughout his life.
The Board finds that the medical evidence of record supports the finding that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms are related to his in-service stressors.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed PTSD and depressive disorder, is granted.
