On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Winston- Salem, North Carolina.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). [The issue of entitlement to a total disability evaluation based upon individual unemployability due to a service- connected disability (TDIU) will be addressed in a separate decision.]
The veteran served on active duty from February 1976 to January 1978.
The veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD is not predicated upon a verified in-service stressor.
Specifically, the RO informed the veteran that, for his claim to be granted, there would have to be evidence of PTSD based on a verified in-service stressor.
However, the evidence of record does not in any way reflect participation in combat with the enemy, and there is no evidence showing that the veteran's current diagnosis of PTSD is based upon a verified stressor from service.
As such, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
The claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
