On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Houston, Texas.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The appellant had active air service from June 1968 to March 1969, with time lost by reason of being absent without leave (AWOL) from duty in December 1968 and January 1969.
Service connection for PTSD requires (i) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD, (ii) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor, and (iii) credible supporting evidence that the in-service stressor occurred.
If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
With regard to the first claimed in-service stressor, the appellant has not submitted any supporting evidence, such as an affidavit by an eyewitness or by some other person claiming to have personal knowledge of the appellant's alleged abuse in December 1968 by the military prison guards, nor has he or his representative identified any existing evidence which would tend to support or corroborate the appellant's statements concerning such alleged abuse.
No supporting evidence whatsoever having been presented or identified, there is no credible evidence that the appellant's second claimed in-service stressor occurred.
Although the appellant received a diagnosis of PTSD during hospitalization in 1995 at a VA medical facility and the record includes subsequent diagnoses of PTSD, service connection may not be granted for PTSD unless all of the requirements of 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.304(f) have been fulfilled, including, for a stressor or stressors not related to combat, credible supporting evidence of the occurrence of the claimed stressor(s) on which the diagnosis of PTSD was based by the psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health professional who rendered it.
Specifically, VA notified the veteran of information and evidence necessary to substantiate the claim;
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is denied.
