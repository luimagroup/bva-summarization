On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Montgomery, Alabama.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1979 to June 1982.
The remand instructions stated that the examiner was to render an opinion as to whether the documented in-service headaches and fainting spells were manifestations of her diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder (to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety).
The examiner was also advised to address the medical literature in the October 2016 Appellate Brief suggesting that fainting and headaches can be physical symptoms of PTSD and can occur as a result of exposure to trauma and the Veteran's September 1980 in-service reports of headaches and fainting spells.
Regarding the Veteran's complaints of headaches and fainting spells in service, the examiner stated, "The Veteran reports multiple pain issues including headaches and back pain.
This, however, does not respond to the question as to whether these headaches and fainting spells were manifestations of a current psychiatric disorder.
Obtain a VA addendum opinion by the same December 2016 examiner, (or another appropriate examiner if unavailable), to provide opinions as to whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent or better probability) that the Veteran's PTSD was caused by OR aggravated (i.e., permanently worsened beyond the natural progress of the disorder) by her service-connected migraine headaches.
The examiner must also opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the in-service episodes of fainting and headaches were a manifestation of a currently diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder.
The appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.
