On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Los Angeles, California.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran's DD-214 discharge report indicates that the veteran served a portion of his active duty in Vietnam where he served as a field artillery crewman.
The veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for PTSD based on his combat experiences while in Vietnam, which his VA psychologist reports as including an incident in which "his landing zone was overrun," requiring the use of 'beehive rounds' of ammunition, resulting in death and dismemberment of many.
The veteran's DD-214 discharge report indicates that the veteran served a portion of his active duty in Vietnam where he served as a field artillery crewman.
His VA psychologist reports that the veteran served in Vietnam as a radioman in the 1st Cavalry Division.  (The veteran's service medical records show Vietnam service with C Battery, 2/19th Artillery, 1st Cavalry Division).
Additionally, the current record does not reflect any meaningful effort to corroborate the veteran's claimed stressors.
The letter sent to the veteran to inform him of the information and evidence necessary to establish his claim, indicated that his claim was for "post pragmatic syndrome" and "post pramatia syndrome," and  there is no indication veteran was ever sent a stressor identification letter.
The RO should request the veteran to provide any additional information, including dates, locations, names of other persons involved, etc. relating to his claimed in-service stressors.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:
