In other words, if the adjudicators determine that the existence of an alleged stressor or stressors in service is not established by the record, a medical examination to determine whether PTSD due to service is present is pointless.
In view of the foregoing, it is the BoardÂ’s judgment that the RO should obtain additional information from the veteran regarding his alleged in-service stressors and forward this information to the USASCRUR for verification of the stressors.
If, and only if, the RO determines that the record establishes the existence of a stressor or stressors, then the RO should arrange for the veteran to be accorded a VA psychiatric examination to determine the diagnosis of all psychiatric disorders that are present.
The RO must specify for the examiner the stressor or stressors that it has determined are established by the record and the examiner must be instructed that only those events may be considered for the purpose of determining whether exposure to a stressor in service has resulted in current psychiatric symptoms and, whether the diagnostic criteria to support the diagnosis of PTSD have been satisfied.
