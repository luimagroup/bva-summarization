In response the RO obtained the veteran's service personnel records and also made a request to the Service Department to check for any TDY orders from May to June 1975 showing TDY for the veteran at Fort Chaffee but was unable to obtain verification of the TDY from either source.
If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
The evidence of record, however, does not establish that the veteran actually had TDY at Fort Chaffee at the time he alleges the killing took place.
In the absence of corroboration that the veteran had TDY at Fort Chaffee and witnessed his alleged stressor event, the killing of a Vietnamese refugee at Fort Chaffee, the preponderance of the evidence is against this claim and it must be denied.
