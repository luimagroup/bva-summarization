By way of a July 2011 pre-adjudication letter, VA notified the Veteran of the information and evidence need to substantiate his service connection claim.
The Veteran maintains that he developed permanent psychiatric trauma as a result of that in-service stressor.
The Board also finds that the competent evidence does not show a relationship between the Veteran's service and his currently diagnosed depression and anxiety.
The Board is mindful that the Veteran asserts that he has experienced chronic psychiatric problems as a result of his service.
