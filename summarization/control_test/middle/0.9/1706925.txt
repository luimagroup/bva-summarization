The Veteran does not have an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, that was caused by his service.
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONThe Veteran contends that he has an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, that was caused by his active duty service.
With regard to PTSD, the Board finds that the evidence is insufficient to show that the Veteran currently has PTSD.
As such, while PTSD may be noted in the record, the Board believes that the weight of the evidence is against the finding that the Veteran has had PTSD at any point during the course of his appeal.
Moreover, at the request of the Veteran's representative, the Board waited 90 days to adjudicate this claim in order for additional evidence to be presented.
The Veteran has been afforded an examination, and he has been determined to not have PTSD, or an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD that is related to his service.
