A comprehensive psychiatric examination and evaluation by a VA staff psychiatrist in April 2003 resulted in the medical opinion that the appellant does not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, but rather currently suffers from alcohol dependence, polysubstance abuse, antisocial and borderline personality disorders, and a history of depressive disorder, with a working diagnosis of dysthymic disorder.
Unfortunately, the VA examiner in April 2003 did not provide the requested opinion concerning the etiology of the appellant's diagnosed dysthymic disorder, and more specifically whether that acquired psychiatric disability is etiologically related to the appellant's military service.
If the April 2003 VA examiner is no longer available, the RO should schedule the appellant for another VA psychiatric examination by a psychiatrist to determine the nature and etiology of any psychiatric disorders present.
If the appellant is found to have any other acquired psychiatric disorder(s), the examiner should provide a medical opinion with respect to each such disorder as to whether it is likely, less likely than not, or as likely as not that the acquired psychiatric disorder is etiologically related to the appellant's military service.
