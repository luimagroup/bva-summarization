After an April 1994 VA examination, the examiner noted that given the veterans on-going alcohol abuse, it was not possible to determine whether the veteran met the criteria for PTSD set forth in the DSM-IIIR.
In March 1994, the veteran submitted a statement to the RO detailing his in service stressors.
Whereas the previously applicable DSM-III-R criteria required that in order to establish a diagnosis of PTSD, the veteran must have undergone an experience which would have been of sufficient gravity to evoke the symptoms of PTSD in almost anyone, and the stressor had to be outside the range of usual human experience, and be markedly distressing to almost anyone, a diagnosis may now be established under DSM-IV when the veteran experiences, witnesses, or is confronted with an event or events that involve actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to his physical integrity or that of others, and his response involves intense fear, helplessness, or horror.
The Board is cognizant of the veterans lengthy appeals process and does not desire to perpetuate this any longer than necessary however, the Board believes that further development of the evidence is necessary, to include a determination of any stressors and an examination to clarify the current psychiatric diagnosis and to determine whether the veteran meets the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD under the DSM-IV criteria.
The veteran should be contacted and requested to furnish a complete list of all medical personnel and facilities from which he has received treatment for PTSD.
The RO should review any information obtained and specify the stressors which are either consistent with the veterans service or verified by the evidence.
