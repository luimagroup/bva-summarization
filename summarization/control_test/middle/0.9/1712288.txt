The Veteran contends that he suffers from PTSD which is due to his experiences in service.
VA treatment records show PTSD and major depressive disorder in remission continued to be assessed by the Veteran's VA treatment providers.
The August 2013 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's current psychiatric symptomatology, including the residuals of PTSD-anxiety disorder NOS, are due to his fear of hostile military or terrorist activity he experienced while serving in Vietnam.
As such, the Board finds that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD with anxiety disorder NOS and major depressive disorder in remission, had its onset during service, and therefore, service connection is warranted.
