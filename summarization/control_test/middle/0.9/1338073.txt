The Board notes that while the Veteran claims service connection for PTSD; he has received a diagnosis of that psychiatric disorder.
As such, the Board has recharacterized the claim as expressed above to include any acquired psychiatric disorder from which the Veteran presently suffers.
The Veteran alleges that he has an acquired psychiatric disorder that is related to service.
A March 2007 written statement from the Veteran's sister submitted in connection with an unrelated claim indicates that the Veteran appeared different upon discharge.
