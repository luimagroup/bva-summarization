PTSD was not shown to be incurred in or aggravated by the veteran's active duty service based on the evidence of record.
Initially, the Board finds that the veteran's claim is "well grounded" within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.A. ยง 5107(a) (West 1991 & Supp. 1999).
Finally, if this happened while the veteran was in service, notice would most likely have come to her family from the service department, not the VA.
Moreover, to the extent that the veteran submitted secondary evidence in the form of a letter purportedly from VA to her father dated in 1961, the Board has also noted that that evidence will be afforded less weight for the reasons described above.
