The Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD due to a verified stressor incurred in service.
The Veteran is seeking service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, claimed as PTSD.
If the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
If a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to the veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of [PTSD] and that the veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
In a July 2010 addendum opinion, based on the fact that the Veteran made no reference to the only verifiable stressor or any aspects of that verifiable stressor (deployment of the USS Barney in support of a rescue attempt during the Iranian Hostage Crisis), the VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's PTSD was not caused by or a result of the verifiable stressor nor is the verifiable stressor linked to the Veteran's current PTSD diagnosis.
The psychologist first addressed the discrepancy between the Veteran's stressor account (helicopter was shot down killing about 12 people on board) and the stressor verification review (no damages or casualties reported), noting that the Veteran does not always report facts as they are in reality.
The examiner added, given that the Veteran is at least as likely as not to have observed the incident as described in the JSRRC's stressor verification review, the stressor-the March 1982 helicopter emergency landing incident-would be adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and the Veteran's PTSD symptoms are related to this stressor.
