The RO should obtain photocopies of all service medical records of the veteran, particular those for treatment during the years 1969 and 1970.
When requesting those records, the RO should make sure that it uses the veteran's current full name and the name he was known thereby while in the US Navy.
If requests for any private treatment records are not successful, the RO should inform the veteran of the nonresponse so that he will have an opportunity to obtain and submit the records himself, in keeping with his responsibility to submit evidence in support of his claim.
The RO should arrange for the veteran to be examined by a psychiatrist, who has not previously examined him, to determine the correct diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder.
