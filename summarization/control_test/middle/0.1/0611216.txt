It does not appear that an attempt has been made to refer the veteran's claims file to the appropriate healthcare professional in order to determine if there is evidence of behavior changes that might indicate the occurrence of an in-service stressor.
A June 1997 letter/statement of Bruce Harmon, a private Washington State Mental Health Counselor, reflects that the veteran reported that he abruptly ended his tour in Vietnam due to returning to the United States on hardship leave to attend the funeral of his father who was killed in an automobile accident.
In a statement, dated in June 2000, the veteran indicates that he did not experience personal assault during AIT or airborne training because he hid himself so well they hardly knew he was there.
The veteran's personnel records have been requested and a response received, which includes some records, but records relating to his period of AWOL, Article 15s (2 Article 15s as shown to have been reported by the veteran in a November 1992 VA treatment record and 1 Article 15 as shown to have been reported by the veteran in a December 1995 VA examination), and records relating to his Airborne training have not been received.
VA treatment records from the Seattle VA Medical Center (MC) have been received through November 1996, but not thereafter.
Letters/statements have been received from Bruce Harmon, a private Washington State Mental Health Counselor, but it does not appear that treatment records have been received from Mr. Harmon.
