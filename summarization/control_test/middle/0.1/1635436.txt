A further literature review failed to find a clear link between diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension.
As to PTSD, the VA specialist noted PTSD causes neuro hormonal changes due to hypervigilance and aggressive behaviors which could potentially worsen the negative effect of hypertension on the heart, but such is speculative.
In conclusion, the Board has competent and credible testimony from the Veteran regarding his exposure to herbicides in-service and a positive probative opinion from a specialist providing a causal connection between the Veteran's hypertension and his active service.
