Under the regulations, service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. ยง 4.125(a) (2003); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.
The veteran has produced medical evidence in the form of a letter from K. Northwall, M.D., which shows that he received a diagnosis of PTSD.
Request specific details of the in-service stressful incident(s): date(s), place(s), unit of assignment at the time of the event(s), description of the event(s), medal(s) or citation(s) received as a result of the event(s), and, if appropriate, name(s) and other identifying information concerning any other individuals involved in the event(s).
The lack of such action may be due to the fact that on the VA examination in March 2002, the examiner did not diagnose PTSD.
The AMC or RO should take the necessary steps to obtain records of the veteran's treatment from Dr Northwall and Dr. Meiler. 3.
