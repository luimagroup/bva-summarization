During his May 2016 Board hearing,  the Veteran testified that he has been attending two different group therapy sessions, one every other Tuesday in Kingsman, Arizona, and another in Las Vegas.
Hence, the AOJ should obtain  all outstanding, pertinent records of mental evaluation and/or treatment of the Veteran, following the procedures prescribed in 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.159(c) as regards requests for records from Federal facilities.
The Veteran need take no action until otherwise notified, but he may furnish additional evidence and/or argument during the appropriate time frame.
