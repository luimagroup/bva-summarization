These are reported to include: being under life threatening sniper fire, working as a combat engineer in outlying locations in daily fear of Vietcong attack, viewing the aftermath of a battle in the Ben Cat area, seeing bodies in bags at an airport, viewing casualties at the Long Bien field hospital, and seeing child victims of the war.
Additionally, service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence establishing a clear diagnosis of the condition, credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred, and a link, established by the medical evidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.
In view of the foregoing, it is the BoardÂ’s judgment that the RO should obtain additional information from the veteran regarding his alleged in-service stressors and forward this information to the USASCRUR for verification of the stressors.
If indicated, the RO should then schedule a VA psychiatric examination.
