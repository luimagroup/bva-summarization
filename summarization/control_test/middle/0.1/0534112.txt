He has described episodes of hazing by his classmates which he alleges occurred every night for three weeks and were witnessed by most of the individuals in his barracks.
In addition, he has not been able to provide any corroborating information, including specific information to enable the service department or the RO to verify that these attacks actually took place as he has described.
Then, the appellant should be scheduled for a VA psychiatric examination (preferably by a psychiatrist) to determine the current psychiatric diagnosis(es) and its(their) relationship, if any, to the appellant's non-active-duty service.
Any indicated studies must be performed, and the claims file, including a copy of this remand, must be made available to and pertinent documents therein reviewed by the examiner.
