The Board also finds that VA has complied with all assistance provisions of VCAA.

If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.
If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
He claimed to have severe feelings of guilt, nightmares, depression, isolation, and continual reliving of these events.
He did not provide any further information with regard to any claimed stressors.
Specifically, although the veteran claims that he cleaned up crash sites in 1973, he did not provide any detailed information pertaining to the date of a specific crash to allow for verification.
Consequently, absent probative supporting evidence, an essential element for a grant of service connection for PTSD is not established.
