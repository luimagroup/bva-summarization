Since the VA has been given notice that the veteran is in receipt of SSA benefits, those records must be obtained and associated in the claims folder.
When requesting those records, the RO should make sure that it uses the veteran's current full name and the name he was known thereby while in the US Navy.
He should be informed that, without such details, an adequate search for verifying information cannot be conducted.
The RO must specifically render a finding as to whether the record establishes the existence of a stressor or stressors.
