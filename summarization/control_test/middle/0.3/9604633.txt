The veteran contends that he developed PTSD as a result of his military service.
A July 1992 VA hospital report included a notation that he claimed that he was beset by marked, constant anger following his return from Vietnam and that he drinks to control his behavior.
He was diagnosed with alcohol dependency, continuous and a mixed personality disorder with antisocial and explosive features.
He stated that there were no clear signs of depression, anxiety, or any other psychotic material.
