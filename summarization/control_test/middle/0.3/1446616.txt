clearly erred in any implicit determination that the remand order was complied with; and, (3) clearly erred in finding that VA satisfied its duty to assist the appellant.
In the January 2010 remand, the Board, in pertinent part, instructed the RO to contact the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) and request that it determine if there are any classified service medical and personnel records for the Veteran, specifically concerning the events purportedly surrounding his capture in February 1962 and March 1962 and duty in a "black ops" unit.
If classified records exist but due to their classification cannot be released to VA, this information should be provided to the Veteran.
After completing all indicated development, the RO should readjudicate the Veteran's claim on appeal in light of all the evidence of record.
