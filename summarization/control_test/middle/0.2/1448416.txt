The claims file contains service treatment records (STRs), service personnel records, VA treatment records, and private treatment records.
While the Veteran had been diagnosed with acquired psychiatric disabilities, there is no indication that they are associated with an in-service event that was not willful misconduct, as discussed below in detail.
As such, the Board finds that the duties set forth in 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.103(c)(2) were satisfied and that the Board can adjudicate the claim based on the current record.
The diagnosis of a mental disorder must conform to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed. 2013) (DSM-V) and be supported by the findings of a medical examiner.
Corroborating evidence is not needed if the claimed in-service stressor is related to the Veteran's "fear of hostile military or terrorist activity."
He reported that when he was buying illegal drugs a person attempted to rob him at knife point.
Then, the Veteran, in a state of panic, cut the body open, put rocks inside it, and pushed it into a river.
At the December 1975 separation examination the examiner noted that the Veteran was normal from a psychiatric standpoint.
