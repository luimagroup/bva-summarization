In reviewing the veteran's claims file, with respect to his reported stressors, the Board notes that the veteran has reported that sometime between July and September 1969, while with HQ Co., 4th Marines, 3rd Marine Division, he witnessed a fellow serviceman, Richard Blane, become engulfed by flames, after some fuel Blane was attempting to move was ignited by fire from a malfunctioning generator.
They show that various HQ Co. units engaged in combat with the enemy and sustained casualties, and that base facilities received enemy rocket and mortar fire.
The RO has not attempted to procure morning reports from the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC).
He should also be asked to obtain and submit any pertinent statements he can obtain from fellow veterans who may be able to corroborate events he has described from service.
