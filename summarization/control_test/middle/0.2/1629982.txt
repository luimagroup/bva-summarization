In this case, as discussed infra, the Veteran is not shown to have service involving a fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.
He identified helicopters as a trigger, but could not explain how it related to his claimed stressor.
Additionally, he was not clear about what memories were being triggered, saying, "All of it."
He was very general in his claims and despite claiming rather severe levels of distress, he was observed to be quite calm throughout the interview.
Accordingly, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim that the Veteran has PTSD due to his service, and that the claim must be denied.
