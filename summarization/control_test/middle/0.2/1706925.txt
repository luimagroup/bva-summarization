The Veteran does not have an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, that was caused by his service.
There is no objective evidence or data to support the diagnosis of PTSD at this time.
There is a significant length of time between the Veteran's military service and his first complaint of mood symptoms.
In addition, he does not cite to any inservice or post-service complaints or findings, other than to note a history of (undated) diagnoses of depression.
Given the foregoing, the Board finds that the medical evidence outweighs the appellant's contentions to the effect that he has the claimed condition due to his service.
Under the circumstances, the Board finds that there has been substantial compliance with its remand.
