An October 2009 correspondence to the Veteran documented the AMC/RO's request for the aforementioned information, but the Veteran's apparently failed to respond.
The Veteran further indicated that this event occurred while he was stationed in Mannheim, Germany.
Accordingly, the Board has no choice but to remand the claim once again to obtain a sufficient medical examination.
The claims folder should be reviewed by the examiner and that review should be indicated in the examination report.
The VA examiner's opinion should specifically address the following:a)  Diagnose any current acquired psychiatric disorder.b)  Provide a full multi-axial diagnosis and specifically state whether or not each criterion for a diagnosis of PTSD is met pursuant to the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM- IV).c)
d)  Discuss whether it is at least as likely as not that any other currently diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder is related to the Veteran's period of service and/or any of his service-connected disorders.
