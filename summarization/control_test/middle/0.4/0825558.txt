The Board has given consideration to the provisions of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA).
Subsequent VA and private treatment records show continued psychiatric problems, including several diagnoses of PTSD.
In order to establish service connection for a veteran who had no combat experience, as here, there must be independent evidence of record to corroborate the veteran's statement as to the occurrence of a claimed stressor.
It was also noted that stressors such as recovering Iraqi bodies or seeing civilians killed could not be verified.
