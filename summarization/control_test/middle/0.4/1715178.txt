The Board finds that all relevant evidence was obtained and the requested examination was completed in December 2013.
Furthermore, the VA examiner opines that "[t]o this point, no psychiatrist identifies sufficient criteria to establish a diagnosis of PTSD."
In considering whether the Veteran suffers from PTSD, the Board has considered the Veteran's statements, both in conjunction with the current appeal and those to treatment providers, as well as the Veteran-submitted buddy statements, regarding the Veteran's in-service stressors and current symptomatology.
In this case, the probative medical opinion of the VA examiner states that the Veteran does not have a personality disorder.
