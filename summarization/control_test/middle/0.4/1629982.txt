In this case, as discussed infra, the Veteran is not shown to have service involving a fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.
He identified helicopters as a trigger, but could not explain how it related to his claimed stressor.
Additionally, he was not clear about what memories were being triggered, saying, "All of it."
Accordingly, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim that the Veteran has PTSD due to his service, and that the claim must be denied.
To the extent that the September 2014 VA examiner indicated that the criteria for PTSD had not been met under DSM-5 (as opposed to DSM-IV), given the lack of a verified stressor, and the examiner's ultimate conclusion that he was unable to provide an etiological opinion due to unreliable self-reporting, this can be no more than harmless error.
