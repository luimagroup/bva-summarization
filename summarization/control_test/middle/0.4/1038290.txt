In July 2010, the Court vacated the Board's decision and remanded the case for readjudication in compliance with directives specified in a July 2010 Joint Motion filed by counsel for the Veteran and the VA Secretary.  FINDING OF FACTIn October 2010, the Board was notified by the RO that the Veteran died in September 2010.
As a matter of law, appellants' claims do not survive their deaths.
This appeal on the merits has become moot by virtue of the death of the Veteran and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
