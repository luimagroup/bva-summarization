In the October 2013 Joint Motion (JMR), it was noted that during the Veteran's December 1, 2011 hearing he commented that he was in receipt of ongoing treatment for PTSD at the Houma VA Outpatient Clinic.
In this regard, it is important for the Veteran to understand that the fact that the Veteran was being treated for PTSD is not in dispute.
The indispensable query is not treatment for PTSD, or a diagnosis of PTSD, but the Veteran's stressors in service.
To avoid further delay, and to give the Veteran every consideration, upon receipt of such records, the VA will provide the Veteran with a VA psychiatric evaluation to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's PTSD, if any.
Whether it is at least as likely as not (a 50% or greater chance) that the Veteran currently suffers from PTSD related to his fear of hostile military or terrorist activity while on active duty, and whether it is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD.
