A September 2010 form indicates that the Veteran was homeless at that time.
This is significant because up to this point, the RO has primarily corresponded with the Veteran through the mail system.
Again, it is entirely possible that he did not report for the hearing because he did not receive the notification.
The Veteran is again advised that he should always try to provide both the RO and the VAMC with a contact address, if possible, and keep it updated.
The RO should initially simply contact the VA medical facilities where the Veteran receives care to ascertain whether they have a current address for him.
