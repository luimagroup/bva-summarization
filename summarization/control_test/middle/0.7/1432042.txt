All efforts have been made to obtain relevant, identified and available evidence, and VA has notified the Veteran of any evidence that could not be obtained.
The Veteran contends that he currently has PTSD that is due to his service in the Republic of Vietnam.
The physician also stated in assessing the Veteran that he had evidence of depressive symptoms, notably anhedonia, as well as a long history of alcohol dependence and a history of cocaine dependence.
Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran has PTSD or that any depressive or anxiety symptoms he does have are related to his military service.
