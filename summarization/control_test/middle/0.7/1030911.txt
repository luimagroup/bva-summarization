The evidence includes a diagnosis by a VA psychiatrist of PTSD based upon a stressor related to the appellant's fear of hostile military activity, and consistent with the places, types and circumstances of his service.
Additionally, during the course of this appeal, 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.304(f) was amended to provide that if a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist or contract equivalent confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
In the December 2004 PTSD Evaluation report, the VA psychiatrist, found that the appellant met criterion A for exposure to a PTSD stressor under the DSM-IV criteria because he was exposed to trauma that involved times of fear, helplessness, and horror as he described the uncertainty of being mortared and other experiences.
The appellant's MOS and assigned principal duty in Vietnam indicate that his claimed stressor of fear of being killed or injured while on patrol or due to mortar attacks was consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the appellant's service, his lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
As the appellant's stressor is consistent with his service as a light weapons infantryman in Vietnam, the Board finds that the occurrence of an in-service PTSD stressor has been established.
In sum, the appellant has been diagnosed as having PTSD, which was linked by a VA psychiatrist in December 2004 to a stressor of fear of death and injury during his service in Vietnam.
