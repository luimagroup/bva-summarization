Additionally, service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence establishing a clear diagnosis of the condition, credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred, and a link, established by the medical evidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.
In other words, if the adjudicators determine that the existence of an alleged stressor or stressors in service is not established by the record, a medical examination to determine whether PTSD due to service is present is pointless.
In view of the foregoing, it is the BoardÂ’s judgment that the RO should obtain additional information from the veteran regarding his alleged in-service stressors and forward this information to the USASCRUR for verification of the stressors.
If, and only if, the RO determines that the record establishes the existence of a stressor or stressors, then the RO should arrange for the veteran to be accorded a VA psychiatric examination to determine the diagnosis of all psychiatric disorders that are present.
