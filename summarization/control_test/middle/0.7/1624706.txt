Specifically, in pertinent part, the Board instructed the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) to send copies of the Veteran's DD Form 214, service personnel records, and any stressor statements submitted by the Veteran to JSRRC in order for an attempt to be made to verify the Veteran's alleged in-service stressor of "having been exposed to hostile fire on the border between North and South Korea" during his period of service, specifically from January 1960 through February 1960.
In addition, the Board notes that there has been some confusion regarding where the Veteran claimed to have been exposed to hostile fire during service.
