With regard to the duty to assist, the claim's file contains the Veteran's available service treatment records, service personnel records, VA and private medical records, and the transcript of a September 2013 hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge.
In each case where a veteran is seeking service connection for any disability, due consideration shall be given to the places, types, and circumstances of such veteran's service as shown by such veteran's service record, the official history of each organization in which such veteran served, such veteran's medical records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence.
Based on a thorough review of the record, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD.
The Veteran's service personnel records and DD 214 fail to show that he was in combat.
The diagnoses of PTSD in the Veteran's VA treatment records and the March 2012 VA examination report do not corroborate that any stressor occurred.
The Board is not bound to accept the Veteran's uncorroborated account of his experiences.
In the absence of a showing of combat with the enemy or evidence of a verifiable stressor, the Board concludes that the Veteran has failed to satisfy the criteria for service connection for PTSD.
In sum, the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection for PTSD.
