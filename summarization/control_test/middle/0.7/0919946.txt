Specifically, in the March 2003 notice, the AOJ notified the Veteran of information and evidence necessary to substantiate his claim for service connection for PTSD.
The Veteran testified to incidents aboard the U.S.S. Hector and U.S.S. Ajax.
Accordingly, service connection for PTSD requires:  (1) a current diagnosis of PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a causal nexus between the current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.
If the evidence establishes that the Veteran was engaged in combat with the enemy or was a prisoner of war (POW), and the claimed stressor is related to combat or POW experiences (in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service), the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
The record here does not contain evidence that demonstrates that the Veteran has PTSD.
Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
