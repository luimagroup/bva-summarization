Although the appellant and his representative have requested that VA assist them in verifying these claimed stressor events in service, they have pointed to no concrete action which VA could take in this regard.
These medical records also reveal that the appellant reportedly had attempted suicide on several occasions prior to his enlistment in the Reserves.
Then, the appellant should be scheduled for a VA psychiatric examination (preferably by a psychiatrist) to determine the current psychiatric diagnosis(es) and its(their) relationship, if any, to the appellant's non-active-duty service.
Based upon the interview with the appellant and especially upon a review of the relevant historical material in the claims file, the VA psychiatric examiner should determine the correct current psychiatric diagnosis(es); for each such current psychiatric diagnosis, the examiner should also state whether or not that disorder is etiologically related to service (and if PTSD is diagnosed, whether it is etiologically related to any verified event occurring in service) or was permanently worsened by any such verified in-service event.
