The Veteran maintains that he developed permanent psychiatric trauma as a result of that in-service stressor.
The Board also finds that the competent evidence does not show a relationship between the Veteran's service and his currently diagnosed depression and anxiety.
The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that "everything started coming back again" after his stroke in 2010.
There is no indication of psychiatric treatment or intervention during the Veteran's active service or for the years immediately following service.
