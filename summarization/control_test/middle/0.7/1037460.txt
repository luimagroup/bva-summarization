An October 2009 correspondence to the Veteran documented the AMC/RO's request for the aforementioned information, but the Veteran's apparently failed to respond.
In the interest of clarity, the Board finds it necessary to again examine the facts surrounding the Veteran's claimed in-service incident, which he maintains caused his current acquired psychiatric disorder.
In March 2006, the Veteran submitted an account of being in very close proximity at the time a fellow service member was killed and of having to view autopsy photos related to this incident.
These etiological questions are central to evaluating the Veteran's service connection claim, and the Board finds the December 2005 VA examination, in this respect, inadequate.
The examiner should record the full history of the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, to include a major depressive disorder and PTSD, including the Veteran's own account of the etiology of his disability.
d)  Discuss whether it is at least as likely as not that any other currently diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder is related to the Veteran's period of service and/or any of his service-connected disorders.
