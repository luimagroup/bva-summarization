The Veteran claims she suffers from an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD since service, but that she did not have a proper diagnosis in service.
The examiner gave the rationale there was no clear contributing persistent stressor due to military service.
Send the Veteran a development letter for PTSD advising her of the need for credible supporting evidence for any claimed stressors that are not combat-related and notifying her that in-service personal assault and/or sexual trauma may be corroborated by evidence from sources other than service records.
After completing the development requested above, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate medical examiner to determine the nature and etiology of any psychiatric disorder(s).
If the examiner does not identify any other acquired psychiatric disorder, the examiner should, to the extent possible, reconcile his or her findings with any contrary medical evidence of record, including VA treatment records documenting diagnoses of major depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD and the December 2010 VA examination.
The examiner should discuss the Veteran's in-service diagnosis of anxiety and any unusual behavior.
If the examiner rejects the Veteran's reports, the examiner must provide an explanation for such rejection.
