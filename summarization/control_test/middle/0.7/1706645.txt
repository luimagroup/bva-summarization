The Veteran contends that his sleep apnea was incurred in service, or in the alternative, that it is secondary to his service-connected PTSD.
In May 2015, pursuant to the Board's February 2015 remand directives, the AOJ afforded the Veteran a VA examination as to his sleep apnea and, in August 2015, obtained that addressed whether such disorder was caused or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD.
However, in the December 2015 remand, the Board found that the examiner did not specifically comment on the Veteran's report of his inability to use the CPAP machine because he associates it with a gas mask, which was problematic as such raised the question of whether any of the Veteran's PTSD symptomatology aggravates his sleep apnea.
In this regard, the examiner offered opinions as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea was related to his service, and/or was caused or aggravated by his PTSD.
However, such opinion does not specifically address the aggravation prong of secondary service connection and, while the examiner noted the Veteran's report that he is unable to use the CPAP machine because he associates it with a gas mask, she did not comment upon whether such results in the causation or aggravation of his sleep apnea.
