The veteran contends that he developed PTSD as a result of his military service.
A July 1992 VA hospital report included a notation that he claimed that he was beset by marked, constant anger following his return from Vietnam and that he drinks to control his behavior.
The examiner reported that the details of combat which the veteran related were very sketchy.
The Board finds that the veteran has presented a wellgrounded claim for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(a) (1994).
