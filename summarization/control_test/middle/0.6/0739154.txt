On the November 1976 separation examination the veteran's psychiatric functioning was found to be normal and the veteran reported that, to the best of his knowledge, he was in good health.
Rather, the record must contain service records or other independent credible evidence to corroborate the veteran's testimony as to the alleged stressor.
The evidence of record, however, does not establish that the veteran actually had TDY at Fort Chaffee at the time he alleges the killing took place.
In the absence of corroboration that the veteran had TDY at Fort Chaffee and witnessed his alleged stressor event, the killing of a Vietnamese refugee at Fort Chaffee, the preponderance of the evidence is against this claim and it must be denied.
