In view of the foregoing, the Board finds that the appellant was notified and aware of the evidence needed to substantiate his claim, as well as the avenues through which he might obtain such evidence, and of the allocation of responsibilities between himself and VA in obtaining such evidence.
The Board finds that the duty to assist is satisfied on this point.
The claimant's assertions that he engaged in combat with the enemy are not ignored, but are evaluated along with the other evidence of record.
However, the claimant's assertions that he "engaged in combat with the enemy" are not sufficient, by themselves, to establish this fact.
