One stressor he testified about in his April 2005 hearing was an incident shortly after he arrived in Guam around late 1958, early 1959, when a marine gate guard shot himself in the head in close proximity to the veteran.
He indicated that the only other stressful incident that took place in Guam was getting beaten up by Marines, but noted there was no report of this incident.
Although there are service personnel records associated with the claims file, which verify his service in Guam in late 1958, with CINCPACFLT from around May 1959 to March 1960 and with the U.S.S. Hull after March 1960 to around May 1961, no real attempt appears to have been made to verify the claimed stressors.
The veteran should be advised to request that his representative send to the AMC any supporting evidence in his possession pertaining to the veteran's duty assignments on the U.S.S. Hull, and any pertinent ships logs, duty assignments, command history and pictures.
and the alleged gunshot suicide in the middle of 1960 by an individual on the U.S.S. Rogers, said to be recorded in the U.S.S. Hull's ship's logs.
After consideration of these stressors, the examiner should explain whether this satisfies  the criteria to support a diagnosis of PTSD.
