Furthermore, the VA examiner opines that "[t]o this point, no psychiatrist identifies sufficient criteria to establish a diagnosis of PTSD."
In considering whether the Veteran suffers from PTSD, the Board has considered the Veteran's statements, both in conjunction with the current appeal and those to treatment providers, as well as the Veteran-submitted buddy statements, regarding the Veteran's in-service stressors and current symptomatology.
In light of the competent medical evidence of record, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence of record indicates that the Veteran does not currently have a diagnosis of PTSD.
In this case, the probative medical opinion of the VA examiner states that the Veteran does not have a personality disorder.
