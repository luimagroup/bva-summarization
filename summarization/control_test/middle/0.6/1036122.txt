If a PTSD claim is based on personal assault in service, evidence from sources other than the Veteran's records may corroborate the Veteran's account of the stressor incident.
The law is clear that VA will not deny a PTSD claim that is based on in-service personal assault without first advising the claimant that evidence from sources other than service records or evidence of behavior changes may constitute credible supporting evidence of the stressor, and allowing him/her the opportunity to furnish this type of evidence or advise VA of potential sources of such evidence.
VA outpatient treatment records reflect a diagnosis of PTSD related to this personal assault incident, but the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2007 where the examiner opined the Veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.
Rather, the examiner noted the Veteran had a significant substance abuse problem that began prior to his military service.
