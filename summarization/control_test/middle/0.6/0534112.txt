Although the appellant and his representative have requested that VA assist them in verifying these claimed stressor events in service, they have pointed to no concrete action which VA could take in this regard.
Written verification of the actual dates of the appellant's active duty for training in 1967 should be obtained from the service department and incorporated into the claims file.
Then, the appellant should be scheduled for a VA psychiatric examination (preferably by a psychiatrist) to determine the current psychiatric diagnosis(es) and its(their) relationship, if any, to the appellant's non-active-duty service.
Any indicated studies must be performed, and the claims file, including a copy of this remand, must be made available to and pertinent documents therein reviewed by the examiner.
