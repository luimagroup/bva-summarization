All efforts have been made to obtain relevant, identified and available evidence, and VA has notified the Veteran of any evidence that could not be obtained.
The Veteran contends that he currently has PTSD that is due to his service in the Republic of Vietnam.
He also stated that his nerves bothered him in the morning but did not feel like he was too anxious most of the day.
Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran has PTSD or that any depressive or anxiety symptoms he does have are related to his military service.
