Collectively, the VCAA letters notified the veteran of what information and evidence is needed to substantiate his claim of service connection for PTSD, as well as what information and evidence must be submitted by the claimant, what information and evidence will be obtained by VA, and the need for the claimant to submit any evidence in his possession that pertains to the claim.
If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.
If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
The veteran's DD Form 214 reflects that he served during the Vietnam Era; however, he had no foreign and/or sea service.
He did not provide any further information with regard to any claimed stressors.
In conclusion, there is no evidence that the veteran engaged in combat and the only evidence of in-service stressors are contained in the veteran's uncorroborated statements, and private medical records based on the veteran's uncorroborated statements.
Thus, there is no probative evidence that the claimed in-service stressors actually occurred.
In view of the foregoing, because there is no credible supporting evidence of an in-service stressor, the Board concludes that the preponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
