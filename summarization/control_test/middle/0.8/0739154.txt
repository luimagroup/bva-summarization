In response the RO obtained the veteran's service personnel records and also made a request to the Service Department to check for any TDY orders from May to June 1975 showing TDY for the veteran at Fort Chaffee but was unable to obtain verification of the TDY from either source.
Rather, the record must contain service records or other independent credible evidence to corroborate the veteran's testimony as to the alleged stressor.
The evidence of record, however, does not establish that the veteran actually had TDY at Fort Chaffee at the time he alleges the killing took place.
In the absence of corroboration that the veteran had TDY at Fort Chaffee and witnessed his alleged stressor event, the killing of a Vietnamese refugee at Fort Chaffee, the preponderance of the evidence is against this claim and it must be denied.
