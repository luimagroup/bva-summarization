An October 2009 correspondence to the Veteran documented the AMC/RO's request for the aforementioned information, but the Veteran's apparently failed to respond.
In the interest of clarity, the Board finds it necessary to again examine the facts surrounding the Veteran's claimed in-service incident, which he maintains caused his current acquired psychiatric disorder.
These etiological questions are central to evaluating the Veteran's service connection claim, and the Board finds the December 2005 VA examination, in this respect, inadequate.
Veteran provides no additional information, the AMC/RO should contact U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC), and request that JSRRC research the claimed in-service incident, and specifically ascertain whether anyone (i) with Company B, 2nd Battalion, 81st Armor, from June 1978 to November 1980; and/or (ii) with the 512th Maintenance Company, from February 1982 to May 1983, was killed, as described by the Veteran.  All development efforts, and/or negative response(s), should be in writing and associated with the claims folder.  3.
The examiner should record the full history of the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, to include a major depressive disorder and PTSD, including the Veteran's own account of the etiology of his disability.
d)  Discuss whether it is at least as likely as not that any other currently diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder is related to the Veteran's period of service and/or any of his service-connected disorders.
