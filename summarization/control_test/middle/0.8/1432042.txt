The DRO told the Veteran and his representative that he did not find the VA examination to be inadequate for rating purposes on its face and it is consistent with other evidence of record.
The Veteran contends that he currently has PTSD that is due to his service in the Republic of Vietnam.
The physician also stated in assessing the Veteran that he had evidence of depressive symptoms, notably anhedonia, as well as a long history of alcohol dependence and a history of cocaine dependence.
Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran has PTSD or that any depressive or anxiety symptoms he does have are related to his military service.
