Nonetheless, the Veteran indicated that he had been fearful for his life and had had repeated nightmares of the incident for the past 30 years.
Then, the Board also finds the May 2008 JSRRC response inadequate as it only addressed whether the Veteran's unit suffered casualties in 1968.
No references were made either to the incident that the Veteran described or to whether the 226th Signal Company was placed on a period of heightened alert during the September 1, 1968 through November 30, 1968 time period.
The AMC should submit another request to the JSRRC requesting it verify whether the Veteran's unit, the 226th Signal Company stationed in the Republic of Korea, at some time between September 1, 1968 through November 30, 1968, was placed on heightened alert as a result of a possible sighting of a large number of enemy ships offshore.
