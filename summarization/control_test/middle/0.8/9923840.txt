If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
In an effort to assist the veteran in completing his claim for service connection for PTSD, the Board finds that additional development (including an attempt to verify claimed in-service stressors, and the other action outlined below) is warranted.
If the veteran's claimed stressors are verified by USASCRUR, the RO should obtain a medical opinion from the VA doctor who performed the October 1996 psychiatric examination.
