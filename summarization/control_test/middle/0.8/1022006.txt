The absence of pertinent complaint or diagnosis in the service medical records, and the pertinently normal clinical findings during service and on the April 1973 separation examination, strongly suggest that neither the Veteran nor trained medical professionals believed that he suffered from chronic hypertension during service or at the time of this separation from service.
In sum, there is no competent or credible evidence suggesting that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension during service or within the one year presumptive period following service, nor is there supporting evidence to suggest any continuity of hypertension from service to show a nexus to service.
The Board finds that service connection for hypertension as secondary to PTSD is also not warranted.
Considering the totality of the evidence, the Board is presented with an evidentiary record which persuasively weighs against service connection for the Veteran's hypertension as secondary to PTSD.
Nevertheless, after thorough review of the evidence currently of record, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as secondary to PTSD.
