The veteran's service medical records confirm the motor vehicle accident (MVA).
Service connection for PTSD, in particular, requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. ยง 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV); (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor(s) occurred; and (3) medical evidence establishing a link between the current diagnosis and the stressor(s) in service.
As an initial matter, medical evidence of record raises a question of whether the veteran had preexisting PTSD at the time of his enlistment.
In so finding, the Board observes that the veteran's service medical records are negative for psychiatric complaints, symptoms, findings or diagnoses.
