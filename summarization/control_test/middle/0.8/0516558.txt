To date, the veteran has not been afforded a VA examination to determine if he has PTSD and, if so, the stressors supporting the diagnosis.
The RO has only requested medical records from VA facilities in Ohio, Kentucky, and Oklahoma since 1990 based upon the veteran's prior statements.
If PTSD is not diagnosed, the examiner should explain why the veteran does not meet the criteria for this diagnosis.
