On the November 1976 separation examination the veteran's psychiatric functioning was found to be normal and the veteran reported that, to the best of his knowledge, he was in good health.
Rather, the record must contain service records or other independent credible evidence to corroborate the veteran's testimony as to the alleged stressor.
The evidence of record, however, does not establish that the veteran actually had TDY at Fort Chaffee at the time he alleges the killing took place.
Thus, in the absence of any indication of an additional source to which the RO could reasonably turn for further corroboration efforts, the Board finds that further development at this point would serve no useful purpose.
