Thus, outstanding mental health records-to  include Prescott VAMC records dated since March 2014 , and Las Vegas VAMC records dated since April 2016-likely exist.
Hence, the AOJ should obtain  all outstanding, pertinent records of mental evaluation and/or treatment of the Veteran, following the procedures prescribed in 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.159(c) as regards requests for records from Federal facilities.
The Veteran need take no action until otherwise notified, but he may furnish additional evidence and/or argument during the appropriate time frame.
