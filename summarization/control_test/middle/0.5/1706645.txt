However, in the December 2015 remand, the Board found that the examiner did not specifically comment on the Veteran's report of his inability to use the CPAP machine because he associates it with a gas mask, which was problematic as such raised the question of whether any of the Veteran's PTSD symptomatology aggravates his sleep apnea.
In this regard, the examiner offered opinions as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea was related to his service, and/or was caused or aggravated by his PTSD.
With regard to the aspect of the Veteran's claim pertaining to direct service connection, the examiner offered sufficient rationale, which included specific consideration of his report that he was recommended to undergo a sleep study during his retirement physical but refused as he thought it would be a waste of time, and his report of trouble sleeping and that he would sleep at two or three hour intervals on his February 1997 Report of Medical History prepared for discharge from service.
Therefore, another remand is necessary in order to obtain an addendum opinion addressing such inquiries.
If the claim remains denied, the Veteran and his representative should be issued a supplemental statement of the case.
