The Veteran contends that she has PTSD as a result of a sexual assault during service.
She stated that during service, she began drinking heavily and using cocaine in July or August 1986, and admitted herself to Gorgas Army Hospital for depression in late August 1986.
Service treatment records reflect that on entrance medical examination in April 1985, a psychiatric disorder was not noted.
If it remains denied, the RO should issue an appropriate supplemental statement of the case and afford the Veteran and her representative the opportunity to respond.
