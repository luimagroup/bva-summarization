The Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD due to a verified stressor incurred in service.
If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.
If a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to the veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of [PTSD] and that the veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
Similarly, in June 2010, the JSRRC confirmed that, in March 1982, while the USS Nicholson was participating in the ASW exercise SHARE 47 in the Ionian Sea, a LAMPS helicopter from the USS McCandless experienced engine failure and radioed to the USS Nicholson for an emergency landing.
Thus, two of the Veteran's stressors have been verified.
Here, the VA examiner has diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD based on an incident involving actual or threatened serious injury or death to the Veteran and others.
Under the circumstances, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for PTSD.
