One stressor he testified about in his April 2005 hearing was an incident shortly after he arrived in Guam around late 1958, early 1959, when a marine gate guard shot himself in the head in close proximity to the veteran.
He indicated that the only other stressful incident that took place in Guam was getting beaten up by Marines, but noted there was no report of this incident.
He should also clarify the approximate dates in which he witnessed the man lost at sea during a transfer between the U.S.S. Oriskany and a supply ship, during a time when he was aboard the U.S.S.
The veteran should be advised to request that his representative send to the AMC any supporting evidence in his possession pertaining to the veteran's duty assignments on the U.S.S. Hull, and any pertinent ships logs, duty assignments, command history and pictures.
and the alleged gunshot suicide in the middle of 1960 by an individual on the U.S.S. Rogers, said to be recorded in the U.S.S. Hull's ship's logs.
After consideration of these stressors, the examiner should explain whether this satisfies  the criteria to support a diagnosis of PTSD.
