In this case, as discussed infra, the Veteran is not shown to have service involving a fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.
He claimed to have daily intrusive memories, but not of any specific event.
He identified helicopters as a trigger, but could not explain how it related to his claimed stressor.
Notwithstanding the notations in VA progress notes of "possible PTSD," or features of PTSD," which are equivocal by their terms, there is no competent evidence to show that the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD.
Accordingly, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim that the Veteran has PTSD due to his service, and that the claim must be denied.
