On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Indianapolis, Indiana.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an anxiety disorder, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1947 to January 1947 and from September 1950 to October 1951.
A preponderance of the competent medical evidence of record does not indicate that the Veteran has PTSD. 2.
After having carefully reviewed the record, the Board has concluded that the notice requirements of the VCAA have been satisfied with respect to the issue on appeal.
"If [there is] evidence [that] is not in your possession, you must give us enough information about the evidence so that we can request it from the person or agency that has it.
If you have any evidence in your possession that pertains to your claim, please send it to us."  This informed the Veteran that he could submit or identify evidence other than what was specifically requested by the RO.
He was first diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder in February 2009, more than 50 years after he left military service.
Entitlement to service connection for an anxiety disorder is denied.
