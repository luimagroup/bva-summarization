On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Columbia, South Carolina.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from August 1970 to February 1972, and from October 1976 to November 1978.
The veteran has produced medical evidence in the form of a letter from K. Northwall, M.D., which shows that he received a diagnosis of PTSD.
Inform the veteran that this information is necessary to obtain supportive evidence of the stressful event(s) and that failure to respond or an incomplete response may result in denial of the claim.
The lack of such action may be due to the fact that on the VA examination in March 2002, the examiner did not diagnose PTSD.
Also, a November 2000 letter from M. Meiler, M.D., indicates that he veteran received treatment from him for the past two years for increasing difficulty sleeping and Dr. Meiler opined that it was perhaps part of PTSD.
The AMC or RO should take the necessary steps to obtain records of the veteran's treatment from Dr Northwall and Dr. Meiler. 3.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify you if further action is required on your part.
