On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in San Juan, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive disorder.
The Veteran had active military service from August 1967 to August 1969.
If it is determined through military citation or other supportive evidence that a Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, and the claimed stressor is related to combat, the Veteran's lay testimony regarding the reported stressor must be accepted as conclusive evidence as to the actual occurrence and no further development or corroborative evidence will be necessary, provided that the testimony is found to be satisfactory and consistent with the circumstances, conditions or hardships of such service.
Any assertions of combat service are not ignored, but are evaluated along with other evidence.
The Board finds that these stressors have been verified by the service department, and that there is credible supporting evidence that these claimed in-service stressors occurred.
The Veteran was hyper alert, cooperative, restless, and fearful.
The Veteran complained of insomnia, anhedonia, lack of energy, and loss of libido.
The record reflects verified in-service stressor events related to the Veteran's combat experiences.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.
