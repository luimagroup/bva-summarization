On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Anchorage, Alaska.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from March 1960 to September 1963.
In the January 2010 remand, the Board, in pertinent part, instructed the RO to contact the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) and request that it determine if there are any classified service medical and personnel records for the Veteran, specifically concerning the events purportedly surrounding his capture in February 1962 and March 1962 and duty in a "black ops" unit.
Particularly, the Court observed that the RO only sought the appellant's personnel records from the NPRC, despite the Board's clear direction that they request that the NPRC determine whether there are any classified service medical and personnel records, particularly any which concern the claimed stressor events in February and March 1962.
In light of the Memorandum Decision, the Board finds that remand is warranted so that the RO may attempt to obtain additional service personnel records that reflect the Veteran's purported service in Vietnam and Laos.
If classified records exist but due to their classification cannot be released to VA, this information should be provided to the Veteran.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
