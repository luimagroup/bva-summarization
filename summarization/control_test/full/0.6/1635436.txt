On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Cleveland, Ohio.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as due to herbicide exposure and secondary to service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and/or diabetes mellitus type II.
The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1966 to April 1969, with service in Vietnam.
In the present case, the Veteran has a diagnosis of hypertension, and the service personnel records show that the Veteran served in Vietnam and is presumed to have been exposed to herbicides during this time.
The Secretary discussed the 2006, 2008, and 2010 Updates, which contain the same analysis with respect to hypertension, in the Federal Register. See e.g. 77 Fed. Reg. 47,924 -01 (Aug. 10, 2012) (noting "[i]n Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 2006 . . . and Update 2008, NAS elevated hypertension to the 'Limited or Suggestive Evidence' category"); 75 Fed. Reg. 32,540, 32,549 (June 8, 2010) ("In Update 2006, NAS concluded that there was 'limited or suggestive evidence of an association between exposure to the compounds of interest and hypertension.'"); 75 Fed. Reg. 81,332, 81,333 (NAS, in 2008, categorized certain health outcomes, including hypertension, to have "'limited or suggestive evidence of an association.'
The specialist noted that while the Veteran has risk factors associated with the development of hypertension, including obesity, chronic tobacco use and diabetes mellitus type II this significant medical literature suggests it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's hypertension is related to his herbicide exposure.
In conclusion, the Board has competent and credible testimony from the Veteran regarding his exposure to herbicides in-service and a positive probative opinion from a specialist providing a causal connection between the Veteran's hypertension and his active service.
Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, as due to herbicide exposure is granted.
