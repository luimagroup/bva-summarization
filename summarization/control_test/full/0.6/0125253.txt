On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Paul, Minnesota.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from July 1943 to June 1947, and from February 1951 to February 1953.
At an RO hearing in June 1999, the veteran claimed that service connection should be granted for any psychiatric disorder, not just PTSD.
The current rebuilt claims folder does not contain the veteran's service medical records.
This VA examination, however, was performed before the veteran submitted many records of past psychiatric treatment.
In view of the fact that the original claims folder has been lost, and given the duty to assist requirements of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000), and a recently enacted companion VA regulation, further development of the evidence is warranted.
The RO should ascertain whether the service department has any copies of the veteran's service medical records;
The RO should ask the veteran to identify (names, locations, dates) all medical providers who treated him at any time for psychiatric problems after service, and the RO should obtain copies of related medical records which are not already on file.
Accordingly, the case is remanded for the following action:
