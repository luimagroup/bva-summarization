On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in St. Petersburg, Florida.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include a depressive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from June 1963 to September 1966.
The Veteran does not have an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, that was caused by his service.
There is a significant length of time between the Veteran's military service and his first complaint of mood symptoms.
In addition, he does not cite to any inservice or post-service complaints or findings, other than to note a history of (undated) diagnoses of depression.
Given the foregoing, the Board finds that the medical evidence outweighs the appellant's contentions to the effect that he has the claimed condition due to his service.
Moreover, at the request of the Veteran's representative, the Board waited 90 days to adjudicate this claim in order for additional evidence to be presented.
The Veteran has been afforded an examination, and he has been determined to not have PTSD, or an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD that is related to his service.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.
