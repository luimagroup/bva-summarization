On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in St. Paul, Minnesota.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active service from November 1971 to December 1975.
A psychiatric disability other than PTSD, was not shown in service, or for years thereafter, and has not been linked to in-service disease or injury.
The Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, was not incurred in or aggravated by his military service.
The claims file contains service treatment records (STRs), service personnel records, VA treatment records, and private treatment records.
The RO did not afford the Veteran a VA examination on the basis that there is already sufficient medical evidence to decide the claim, and the Board agrees.
While the Veteran had been diagnosed with acquired psychiatric disabilities, there is no indication that they are associated with an in-service event that was not willful misconduct, as discussed below in detail.
If the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, then, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
Corroborating evidence is not needed if the claimed in-service stressor is related to the Veteran's "fear of hostile military or terrorist activity."
Then, the Veteran, in a state of panic, cut the body open, put rocks inside it, and pushed it into a river.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, is denied.
