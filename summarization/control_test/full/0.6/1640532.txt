On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active duty service from June 1980 to September 1988.
The Veteran claims she suffers from an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD since service, but that she did not have a proper diagnosis in service.
An August 2009 VA treatment record reflects severe depression possibly attributed to military intelligence stress and dangerous situations.
Send the Veteran a development letter for PTSD advising her of the need for credible supporting evidence for any claimed stressors that are not combat-related and notifying her that in-service personal assault and/or sexual trauma may be corroborated by evidence from sources other than service records.
After completing the development requested above, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate medical examiner to determine the nature and etiology of any psychiatric disorder(s).
If the examiner does not identify any other acquired psychiatric disorder, the examiner should, to the extent possible, reconcile his or her findings with any contrary medical evidence of record, including VA treatment records documenting diagnoses of major depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD and the December 2010 VA examination.
The examiner should discuss the Veteran's in-service diagnosis of anxiety and any unusual behavior.
If the examiner rejects the Veteran's reports, the examiner must provide an explanation for such rejection.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
