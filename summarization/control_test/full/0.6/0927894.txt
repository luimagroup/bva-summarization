On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Oakland, California.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from May 1985 to November 1986.
The Veteran contends that she has PTSD as a result of a sexual assault during service.
She stated that during service, she began drinking heavily and using cocaine in July or August 1986, and admitted herself to Gorgas Army Hospital for depression in late August 1986.
Service treatment records reflect that on entrance medical examination in April 1985, a psychiatric disorder was not noted.
(iii) if the answer is no, is it at least as likely as not that the psychiatric disorder had its onset in service? (b) What is the correct diagnosis for the Veteran's current psychiatric disability?
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.
