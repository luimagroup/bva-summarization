On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in New Orleans, Louisiana.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active military service from February 1953 to December 1954.
In April 2013, the record contained records from the Houma VA Outpatient Clinic, but they only covered a period up to 2008.
The indispensable query is not treatment for PTSD, or a diagnosis of PTSD, but the Veteran's stressors in service.
To avoid further delay, and to give the Veteran every consideration, upon receipt of such records, the VA will provide the Veteran with a VA psychiatric evaluation to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's PTSD, if any.
Whether it is at least as likely as not (a 50% or greater chance) that the Veteran currently suffers from PTSD related to his fear of hostile military or terrorist activity while on active duty, and whether it is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD.
The examiner should reconcile any opinions with the service treatment records, post-service medical evidence, and lay statements of the Veteran.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
