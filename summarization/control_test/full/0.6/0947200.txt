On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in St. Petersburg, Florida.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from September 1967 to May 1969.
Nonetheless, the Veteran indicated that he had been fearful for his life and had had repeated nightmares of the incident for the past 30 years.
Specifically, the AMC requested the JSRRC verify that the Veteran's unit was placed on a heightened alert over witnessing one hundred ships on the beach the Veteran's unit was assigned to.
The AMC should submit another request to the JSRRC requesting it verify whether the Veteran's unit, the 226th Signal Company stationed in the Republic of Korea, at some time between September 1, 1968 through November 30, 1968, was placed on heightened alert as a result of a possible sighting of a large number of enemy ships offshore.
If and only if the attempt to obtain evidence corroborating the Veteran's claimed stressor proves successful, the Veteran should be afforded a VA psychiatric examination for the purposes of determining whether a current diagnosis of PTSD is appropriate, and, if so, whether that diagnosis may be etiologically related to the corroborated stressor.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
