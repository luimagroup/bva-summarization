On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Boston, Massachusetts.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from April 1960 to March 1964.
The Veteran contends that he suffers from PTSD as a result of his active-duty service.
If a PTSD claim is based on an in-service personal assault, medical opinion evidence may be submitted for use in determining whether the occurrence of a stressor is corroborated.
The Veteran reported that this training, which was meant to simulate a "prisoner of war" scenario, required that he crawl through a wire enclosure while being hit, kicked and verbally accosted.
Finally, there is credible supporting evidence that the in-service stressor occurred as alleged.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, manifested by PTSD, is granted.
