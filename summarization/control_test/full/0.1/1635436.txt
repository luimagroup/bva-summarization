On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Cleveland, Ohio.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as due to herbicide exposure and secondary to service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and/or diabetes mellitus type II.
The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1966 to April 1969, with service in Vietnam.
As a result the Board finds that service connection is warranted on a direct basis.
A further literature review failed to find a clear link between diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension.
As to PTSD, the VA specialist noted PTSD causes neuro hormonal changes due to hypervigilance and aggressive behaviors which could potentially worsen the negative effect of hypertension on the heart, but such is speculative.
In conclusion, the Board has competent and credible testimony from the Veteran regarding his exposure to herbicides in-service and a positive probative opinion from a specialist providing a causal connection between the Veteran's hypertension and his active service.
Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, as due to herbicide exposure is granted.
