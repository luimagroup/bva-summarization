On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Roanoke, Virginia.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from February 1968 to November 1969.
His service personnel records reflect that he served at Camp Haines, Camp Evans, and the Republic of Vietnam.
After an April 1994 VA examination, the examiner noted that given the veteranÂ’s on-going alcohol abuse, it was not possible to determine whether the veteran met the criteria for PTSD set forth in the DSM-IIIR.
Additionally, the history verified that passenger vehicles struck land mines in August and September 1969.
A subsequent letter scheduled him for a hearing before RO personnel, but there was no indication that he asked to be taken off the travel board list.
When the RO is satisfied that the record is complete and the psychiatric examination is adequate for rating purposes, the RO should proceed with an adjudication of the claim on the merits.
If so, he should be placed on the list for such hearing.
This case is remanded
