On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Montgomery, Alabama.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychological disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and panic disorder.
The Veteran had active duty service from October 1978 to May 1979 and January 1983 to June 1983.
The examiner assessed anxiety attack with hyperventilation.
One of the rapes took place when he offered her a ride home in his car, and the other occurred when he attacked her upon entering her residence.
She recalled the assailant was also in the military and that she met him at the base cafeteria.
In summary, the record contains credible evidence of in-service sexual assaults and competent medical evidence showing that the Veteran's current symptoms meet the PTSD diagnostic criteria and are related to the reported in-service sexual assault stressors.
Service connection for an acquired psychological disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and panic disorder is granted.
