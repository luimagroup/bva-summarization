On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Roanoke, Virginia.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from October 1943 to October 1948.
However, there has been a significant change in the law during the pendency of this appeal.
Under the circumstances of this case, as part of the duty to assist, an effort should be made to verify service stressors, any additional post-service medical records should be obtained, and a VA compensation examination for PTSD should be provided.
If PTSD is diagnosed, the doctor should identify the stressors which are believed to be the cause of the condition, and the doctor should explain why such stressors are sufficient under DSM-IV.4.
If the claim remains denied, the veteran and his representative should be provided with a supplemental statement of the case, and given an opportunity to respond, before the case is returned to the Board.
Accordingly, this case is REMANDED for the following:
