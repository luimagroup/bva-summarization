On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Chicago, Illinois.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from August 1970 to May 1974.
If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.
He was diagnosed with rule out schizoaffective disorder, alcohol dependency in remission.
Dr. E.P.A. stated that the Veteran had been consistent in reporting these in-service symptoms.
The Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise in this case.
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include PTSD is granted.
