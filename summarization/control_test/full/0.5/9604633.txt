On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Togus, Maine.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post�traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from November 1966 to August 1967.
The veteran contends that he developed PTSD as a result of his military service.
A July 1992 VA hospital report included a notation that he claimed that he was beset by marked, constant anger following his return from Vietnam and that he drinks to control his behavior.
He stated that there were no clear signs of depression, anxiety, or any other psychotic material.
The Board finds that the veteran has presented a wellgrounded claim for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(a) (1994).
This case is remanded
