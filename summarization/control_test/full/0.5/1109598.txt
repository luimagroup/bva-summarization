On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in San Juan, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive disorder.
The Veteran had active military service from August 1967 to August 1969.
Any assertions of combat service are not ignored, but are evaluated along with other evidence.
While there, he saw soldiers operating a front loader and throwing dead bodies into a ditch.
The Veteran was hyper alert, cooperative, restless, and fearful.
The Veteran complained of insomnia, anhedonia, lack of energy, and loss of libido.
Initially, the Board notes that the psychiatrists noted that there were no symptoms of re-experiencing the traumatic event.
The record reflects verified in-service stressor events related to the Veteran's combat experiences.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.
