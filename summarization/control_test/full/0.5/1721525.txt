On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Boston, Massachusetts.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from April 1960 to March 1964.
The Veteran contends that he suffers from PTSD as a result of his active-duty service.
The Veteran reported that this training, which was meant to simulate a "prisoner of war" scenario, required that he crawl through a wire enclosure while being hit, kicked and verbally accosted.
After reviewing the evidence described above, the Board finds that the competent medical evidence of record indicates that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, which is related to his service.
Finally, there is credible supporting evidence that the in-service stressor occurred as alleged.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, manifested by PTSD, is granted.
