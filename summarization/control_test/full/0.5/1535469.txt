On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Columbia, South Carolina.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety.
The Veteran served on active duty from August 1980 to August 1983.
The RO subsequently made a formal finding of lack of information to corroborate the alleged stressor.
The Veteran maintains that he developed permanent psychiatric trauma as a result of that in-service stressor.
The Board also finds that the competent evidence does not show a relationship between the Veteran's service and his currently diagnosed depression and anxiety.
The inconsistencies of the Veteran's statements are understandable given the memory impairment that resulted from his stroke, but they undermine his credibility nonetheless.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety, is denied.
