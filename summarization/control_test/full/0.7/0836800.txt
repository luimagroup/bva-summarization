On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Atlanta, Georgia.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from December 1984 to December 1987.
The veteran's service medical records confirm the motor vehicle accident (MVA).
Service connection for PTSD, in particular, requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. ยง 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV); (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor(s) occurred; and (3) medical evidence establishing a link between the current diagnosis and the stressor(s) in service.
In so finding, the Board observes that the veteran's service medical records are negative for psychiatric complaints, symptoms, findings or diagnoses.
Overall, the Board finds that the evidence shows that the veteran did not incur or aggravate PTSD during active duty.
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
