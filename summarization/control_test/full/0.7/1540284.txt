On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Chicago, Illinois.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from August 1970 to May 1974.
If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.
She further stated that she believes that the Veteran's schizoaffective disorder began during military service.
She stated that in 1974, the Veteran was prescribed Lithium by someone who may or may not have been a psychiatrist (the Veteran could not remember).
Dr. E.P.A. stated that the Veteran had been consistent in reporting these in-service symptoms.
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include PTSD is granted.
