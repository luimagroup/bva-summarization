On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Montgomery, Alabama.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychological disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and panic disorder.
The Veteran had active duty service from October 1978 to May 1979 and January 1983 to June 1983.
If a PTSD claim is based on in-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than the veteran's service records may corroborate her account of the stressor incident.
Overall, the Board finds the evidence probative to show that two in-service sexual assaults occurred.
In summary, the record contains credible evidence of in-service sexual assaults and competent medical evidence showing that the Veteran's current symptoms meet the PTSD diagnostic criteria and are related to the reported in-service sexual assault stressors.
The Board notes that additional psychiatric diagnoses of anxiety disorder, major depression, and panic disorder are raised by the record.
Service connection for an acquired psychological disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and panic disorder is granted.
