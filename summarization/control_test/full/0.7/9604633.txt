On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Togus, Maine.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post�traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from November 1966 to August 1967.
The veteran contends that he developed PTSD as a result of his military service.
The veteran does not have posttraumatic stress disorder which was incurred in or aggravated by military service.
The Board finds that the veteran has presented a wellgrounded claim for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(a) (1994).
The VA psychiatric examination in November 1992 noted the veterans history of combat experiences, but did not diagnosis PTSD.
This case is remanded
