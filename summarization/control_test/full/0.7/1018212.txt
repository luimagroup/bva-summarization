On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Seattle, Washington.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The appellant served on active duty in the United States Air Force from February 1949 to October 1970.
All the law requires is that the duty to notify is satisfied and that claimants are given the opportunity to submit information and evidence in support of their claims.
In view of the foregoing, the Board finds that the appellant was notified and aware of the evidence needed to substantiate his claim, as well as the avenues through which he might obtain such evidence, and of the allocation of responsibilities between himself and VA in obtaining such evidence.
The claimant's assertions that he engaged in combat with the enemy are not ignored, but are evaluated along with the other evidence of record.
However, the claimant's assertions that he "engaged in combat with the enemy" are not sufficient, by themselves, to establish this fact.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
