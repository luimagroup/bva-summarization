On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Houston, Texas.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active military service from June 1965 to August 1972, including two tours of duty in the Republic of Vietnam.
All efforts have been made to obtain relevant, identified and available evidence, and VA has notified the Veteran of any evidence that could not be obtained.
The Veteran contends that he currently has PTSD that is due to his service in the Republic of Vietnam.
The physician also stated in assessing the Veteran that he had evidence of depressive symptoms, notably anhedonia, as well as a long history of alcohol dependence and a history of cocaine dependence.
Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran has PTSD or that any depressive or anxiety symptoms he does have are related to his military service.
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.
