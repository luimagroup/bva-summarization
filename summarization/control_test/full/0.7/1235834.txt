On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Houston, Texas.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression/alcoholism.
The appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty from July 1961 to July 1963.
Factual BackgroundThe Veteran claims that he developed a psychiatric disorder, alleged to be PTSD and depression, from serving at Plattsburgh Air Force Base (a SAC base) from January 1962 to July 1963 during the Cuban Missile Crisis (CMC).
The Veteran's written communications and hearing testimony include his recollection that he saw a base psychiatrist and a chaplain prior to service discharge.
The Veteran recalls that they were told that, if the aircraft were launched, the Soviets would retaliate with nuclear weapons.
The C&P of 2010 mentions that there was a history of panic attacks and current symptom of worrying, but there is not enough information about the extent of the worrying, or other symptoms that would clarify an anxiety disorder.
A disorder may be service connected if the evidence of record shows that the veteran currently has a disorder that was chronic in service or, if not chronic, that was seen in service with continuity of symptomatology demonstrated thereafter.
When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.
Service connection depressive disorder is granted.
