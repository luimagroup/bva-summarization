On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for claimed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran is not shown to have had combat with the enemy while serving on active duty, including during his active service in the Persian Gulf   2.
In accordance with the requirements of VCAA, the letters informed the veteran what evidence and information he was responsible for and the evidence that was considered VA's responsibility.
The veteran asserts that he has PTSD caused by stressful events to which he was exposed in service.
In order to establish service connection for a veteran who had no combat experience, as here, there must be independent evidence of record to corroborate the veteran's statement as to the occurrence of a claimed stressor.
In summary, because all of the elements required for a finding of service connection for PTSD are not shown, the preponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim.
Service connection for claimed PTSD is denied.
