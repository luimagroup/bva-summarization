On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Seattle, Washington.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), and major depressive disorder.
The Veteran had active service from October 1959 to April 1960, November 1961 to August 1962, April 1964 to February 1974.
The Veteran contends that he suffers from PTSD which is due to his experiences in service.
If a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terroristic activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimant's stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of events in service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in service stressor.
VA treatment records show PTSD and major depressive disorder in remission continued to be assessed by the Veteran's VA treatment providers.
The examiner diagnosed residuals, including anxiety disorder NOS, and opined it was at as likely as not incurred in service.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD with anxiety disorder NOS and major depressive disorder in remission, is granted
