On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Oakland, California.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The appellant is a veteran who served on active duty from 
In response the RO obtained the veteran's service personnel records and also made a request to the Service Department to check for any TDY orders from May to June 1975 showing TDY for the veteran at Fort Chaffee but was unable to obtain verification of the TDY from either source.
Where VA determines that the veteran did not engage in combat, the veteran's lay testimony, by itself, as a matter of law, cannot be sufficient to establish the alleged stressor.
Rather, the record must contain service records or other independent credible evidence to corroborate the veteran's testimony as to the alleged stressor.
The evidence of record, however, does not establish that the veteran actually had TDY at Fort Chaffee at the time he alleges the killing took place.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
