On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Boston, Massachusetts.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from April 1960 to March 1964.
Competent and persuasive medical evidence indicates that the Veteran's current PTSD is causally related to his in-service stressor.
The Veteran contends that he suffers from PTSD as a result of his active-duty service.
The December 2010 VA examiner provided competent medical evidence indicating that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms were caused by his traumatic experiences in service.
Finally, there is credible supporting evidence that the in-service stressor occurred as alleged.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, manifested by PTSD, is granted.
