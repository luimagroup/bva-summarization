On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Los Angeles, California.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as secondary to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from February 1969 to April 1973.
it was not likely that the Veteran's hypertensin was caused by his service-connected PTSD, to include associated panic and anxiety disorders; and (3) it is at least as likely as not that the
In sum, there is no competent or credible evidence suggesting that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension during service or within the one year presumptive period following service, nor is there supporting evidence to suggest any continuity of hypertension from service to show a nexus to service.
The Board finds that service connection for hypertension as secondary to PTSD is also not warranted.
Considering the totality of the evidence, the Board is presented with an evidentiary record which persuasively weighs against service connection for the Veteran's hypertension as secondary to PTSD.
Nevertheless, after thorough review of the evidence currently of record, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as secondary to PTSD.
The appeal is denied.
