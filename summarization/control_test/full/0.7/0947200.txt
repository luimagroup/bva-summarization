On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in St. Petersburg, Florida.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from September 1967 to May 1969.
Nonetheless, the Veteran indicated that he had been fearful for his life and had had repeated nightmares of the incident for the past 30 years.
