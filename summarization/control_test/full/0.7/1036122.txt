On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Waco, Texas.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), claimed as due to in-service personal assault.
The Veteran served on active duty from March 1977 to January 1978.
If a PTSD claim is based on personal assault in service, evidence from sources other than the Veteran's records may corroborate the Veteran's account of the stressor incident.
VA outpatient treatment records reflect a diagnosis of PTSD related to this personal assault incident, but the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2007 where the examiner opined the Veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.
The Veteran should also be notified that in-service personal assault may be corroborated by evidence from sources other than the service records, as defined in 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.304(f)(3) (2009).
An appropriate period of time should be allowed for the Veteran to respond and/or submit additional evidence.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
