On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from February 1972 to May 1973.
The Board finds that all relevant evidence was obtained and the requested examination was completed in December 2013.
While the Veteran is competent to report (1) symptoms observable to a layperson, e.g., depression or anxiety; (2) a diagnosis that is later confirmed by clinical findings; or (3) a contemporary diagnosis, he is not competent to independently render a medical diagnosis or opine as to the specific etiology of a condition.
Furthermore, the VA examiner opines that "[t]o this point, no psychiatrist identifies sufficient criteria to establish a diagnosis of PTSD."
In considering whether the Veteran suffers from PTSD, the Board has considered the Veteran's statements, both in conjunction with the current appeal and those to treatment providers, as well as the Veteran-submitted buddy statements, regarding the Veteran's in-service stressors and current symptomatology.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.
