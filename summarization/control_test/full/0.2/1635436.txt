On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Cleveland, Ohio.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as due to herbicide exposure and secondary to service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and/or diabetes mellitus type II.
The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1966 to April 1969, with service in Vietnam.
The Secretary discussed the 2006, 2008, and 2010 Updates, which contain the same analysis with respect to hypertension, in the Federal Register. See e.g. 77 Fed. Reg. 47,924 -01 (Aug. 10, 2012) (noting "[i]n Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 2006 . . . and Update 2008, NAS elevated hypertension to the 'Limited or Suggestive Evidence' category"); 75 Fed. Reg. 32,540, 32,549 (June 8, 2010) ("In Update 2006, NAS concluded that there was 'limited or suggestive evidence of an association between exposure to the compounds of interest and hypertension.'"); 75 Fed. Reg. 81,332, 81,333 (NAS, in 2008, categorized certain health outcomes, including hypertension, to have "'limited or suggestive evidence of an association.'
As a result the Board finds that service connection is warranted on a direct basis.
A further literature review failed to find a clear link between diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension.
In conclusion, the Board has competent and credible testimony from the Veteran regarding his exposure to herbicides in-service and a positive probative opinion from a specialist providing a causal connection between the Veteran's hypertension and his active service.
Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, as due to herbicide exposure is granted.
