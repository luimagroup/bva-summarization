On appeal from the decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Manchester, New Hampshire.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from August 1964 to August 1968, and from June 1971 to December 1977.
Based on its review of the evidence in this matter, and for the following reasons and bases, it is the decision of the Board that service connection for PTSD is warranted.
He reported a history of diarrhea for 25 years, restlessness, nervousness, inability to concentrate, nightmares about Vietnam, becoming easily angry, irritable, light sleep only and alerted by noises, overreactive, easily jumpy, occasionally depressed and avoidance of people.
In the case at hand, the veteran has described an event where the enemy attacked an air base where the veteran was stationed at night in early December 1966 with resulting loss of considerable life of the enemy as well as the wounding of American soldiers and the death of at least three soldiers, and damage to the air field.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.
