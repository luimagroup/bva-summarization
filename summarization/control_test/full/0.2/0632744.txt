On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in No. Little Rock, Arkansas.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active service from April 1965 until May 1970.
The evidence does not establish that the veteran participated in combat with the enemy.
Here, the Board finds that any defect with respect to the timing of the VCAA notice was harmless error.
The veteran states that his in-service stressor occurred when he served abroad in Korea.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
