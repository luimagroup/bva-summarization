On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Paul, Minnesota.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from July 1943 to June 1947, and from February 1951 to February 1953.
At an RO hearing in June 1999, the veteran claimed that service connection should be granted for any psychiatric disorder, not just PTSD.
The current rebuilt claims folder does not contain the veteran's service medical records.
This VA examination, however, was performed before the veteran submitted many records of past psychiatric treatment.
The RO should ascertain whether the service department has any copies of the veteran's service medical records;
The RO should ask the veteran to identify (names, locations, dates) all medical providers who treated him at any time for psychiatric problems after service, and the RO should obtain copies of related medical records which are not already on file.
The RO should also ask the veteran and his representative to submit copies of any records in their possession concerning past VA adjudications prior to the original claims folder being lost.
Accordingly, the case is remanded for the following action:
