On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Muskogee, Oklahoma.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a chronic acquired psychiatric disability, including schizophrenia and/or post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The appellant is not a veteran, and he has never served on active duty.
Finally, an official VA psychiatric examination of the appellant in October 2002 (conducted without a review of most of the relevant medical records) resulted in a diagnosis of schizophrenia, undifferentiated type.
A current VA psychiatric examination of the appellant addressing all of the outstanding medical questions presented by this appeal would be most helpful to the Board in its appellate consideration of this claim.
Then, the appellant should be scheduled for a VA psychiatric examination (preferably by a psychiatrist) to determine the current psychiatric diagnosis(es) and its(their) relationship, if any, to the appellant's non-active-duty service.
Based upon the interview with the appellant and especially upon a review of the relevant historical material in the claims file, the VA psychiatric examiner should determine the correct current psychiatric diagnosis(es); for each such current psychiatric diagnosis, the examiner should also state whether or not that disorder is etiologically related to service (and if PTSD is diagnosed, whether it is etiologically related to any verified event occurring in service) or was permanently worsened by any such verified in-service event.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify you if further action is required on your part.
