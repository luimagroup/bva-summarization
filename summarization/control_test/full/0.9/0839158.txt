On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Louisville, Kentucky.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, mood disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as due to military sexual trauma.
The veteran served on active duty from March 1976 to November 1977.
In February 2005, the veteran's mental health care provider opined that the veteran's diagnoses of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, and mood disorder were related to an in-service sexual trauma.
The RO should arrange for the veteran to undergo a VA psychiatric examination by an examiner with appropriate expertise to determine the nature, extent and etiology of the veteran's psychiatric disability or disabilities, to include bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, mood disorder, and PTSD, if found to be present.
In reviewing the veteran's claims file, the examiner should identify and examine all records including the performance evaluations, July 1977 Article 15, August 1977 record which showed he was evaluated by mental health for an adjustment disorder, October 1977 report of depression/excessive worry, as well as all post-service medical evidence to the claimed sexual trauma alleged by the veteran to have occurred during active service, and offer an opinion as to the clinical significance, if any, of such evidence in light of the veteran's psychiatric diagnoses and whether, under such circumstances, such are sufficient evidence of an actual stressor.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.
