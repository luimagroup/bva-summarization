On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for hypertension to include as secondary to head/neck trauma and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from October 1973 to October 1993.
The Board observes that the September 2008 Board remand requested that the Veteran be provided with a VA examination and opinion addressing the question of whether it is more likely than not, at least as likely as no or less likely than not (i.e., probability less than 50 percent) that the Veteran's service-connected residuals of head trauma or PTSD caused or aggravated his hypertension.
The VA examiner provided the opinion that the Veteran's hypertension is not likely to be aggravated by his PTSD.
The examiner is requested to review all pertinent records associated with the claims file and offer an opinion as to whether it is more likely than not (i.e., probably greater than 50 percent), at least as likely as not (i.e., probability of 50 percent), or less likely than not (i.e., probability less than 50 percent), that the Veteran's service-connected residuals of head trauma and/or PTSD caused or aggravated his hypertension.
The examiner should also provide an opinion on whether the Veteran's hypertension is as likely as not (i.e., probability of 50 percent) related to active military service or any symptomatology shown in service.
If the examiner who conducted the December 2008 VA examination is unavailable, then the RO should provide the Veteran with a VA examination from a cardiologist or hypertensionologist to determine the etiology of the Veteran's hypertension.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.
