On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Roanoke, Virginia.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from October 1943 to October 1948.
In denying the claim, the RO stated that the veteran's claimed stressors for PTSD have not been verified, and that there is no confirmed diagnosis of PTSD even though he has been noted to have "PTSD symptoms" short of a diagnosis.
Under the circumstances of this case, as part of the duty to assist, an effort should be made to verify service stressors, any additional post-service medical records should be obtained, and a VA compensation examination for PTSD should be provided.
Thereafter, the RO should have the veteran undergo a VA psychiatric examination to diagnose or rule out PTSD.
Thereafter, the RO should review, on the merits, the claim for service connection for PTSD.
Accordingly, this case is REMANDED for the following:
