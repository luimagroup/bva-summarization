On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Cleveland, Ohio.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as due to herbicide exposure and secondary to service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and/or diabetes mellitus type II.
The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1966 to April 1969, with service in Vietnam.
The Board finds the evidence of record supports that there is a causal connection between the Veteran's active service to include his presumed herbicide exposure and current hypertension.
The specialist noted that while the Veteran has risk factors associated with the development of hypertension, including obesity, chronic tobacco use and diabetes mellitus type II this significant medical literature suggests it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's hypertension is related to his herbicide exposure.
Further, the opinion from the VA specialist noted that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's hypertension was caused by his service-connected diabetes mellitus type II.
In conclusion, the Board has competent and credible testimony from the Veteran regarding his exposure to herbicides in-service and a positive probative opinion from a specialist providing a causal connection between the Veteran's hypertension and his active service.
Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, as due to herbicide exposure is granted.
