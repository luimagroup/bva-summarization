On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Indianapolis, Indiana.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an anxiety disorder, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1947 to January 1947 and from September 1950 to October 1951.
A preponderance of the competent medical evidence of record does not indicate that the Veteran has PTSD. 2.
The evidence of record does not support a finding that a relationship exists between the Veteran's currently diagnosed anxiety disorder and his military service.
When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.
"If [there is] evidence [that] is not in your possession, you must give us enough information about the evidence so that we can request it from the person or agency that has it.
If you have any evidence in your possession that pertains to your claim, please send it to us."  This informed the Veteran that he could submit or identify evidence other than what was specifically requested by the RO.
Entitlement to service connection for an anxiety disorder is denied.
