On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in San Juan, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive disorder.
The Veteran had active military service from August 1967 to August 1969.
Two of the Veteran's alleged in-service stressors have been verified; the Veteran's treating psychiatric professionals endorse a finding of PTSD associated with the verified combat stressors.
On the question of the occurrence of an in-service stressor to support the diagnosis of PTSD, the evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of an in-service stressor varies depending on whether or not the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy.
If it is determined through military citation or other supportive evidence that a Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, and the claimed stressor is related to combat, the Veteran's lay testimony regarding the reported stressor must be accepted as conclusive evidence as to the actual occurrence and no further development or corroborative evidence will be necessary, provided that the testimony is found to be satisfactory and consistent with the circumstances, conditions or hardships of such service.
Any assertions of combat service are not ignored, but are evaluated along with other evidence.
None of the medals that the Veteran received, to include the National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, and Vietnam Service Medal, denote combat service.
The record reflects verified in-service stressor events related to the Veteran's combat experiences.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.
