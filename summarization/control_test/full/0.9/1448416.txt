On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in St. Paul, Minnesota.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active service from November 1971 to December 1975.
The Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, was not incurred in or aggravated by his military service.
While the Veteran had been diagnosed with acquired psychiatric disabilities, there is no indication that they are associated with an in-service event that was not willful misconduct, as discussed below in detail.
If the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, then, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
Corroborating evidence is not needed if the claimed in-service stressor is related to the Veteran's "fear of hostile military or terrorist activity."
Then, the Veteran, in a state of panic, cut the body open, put rocks inside it, and pushed it into a river.
Although the Veteran is competent to report on his own symptomatology, to the extent that he is claiming he has had symptoms since service related to an acquired psychiatric disability, the Board does not find him to be credible.
The STRs, including the Veteran's own December 1975 medical history report, which do not show symptomatology during service, are of more probative value than his current reports because they were contemporaneous to his active service.
To the extent that the Veteran and his family, through their statements and hearing testimony, are claiming that he has an acquired psychiatric disability due to an incident related to service that was not willful misconduct, they are not competent to make such a determination.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, is denied.
