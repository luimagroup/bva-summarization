On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from August 1966 to May 1969 and from June 1974 to June 1975.
The veteran's accounts of stressors in service are uncorroborated by objective evidence.
If the determination with respect to this step is affirmative, then (and only then), a second step requires that the veterans lay testimony regarding claimed stressors must be accepted as conclusive as to their actual occurrence and no further development or corroborative evidence will be required, provided that the veterans testimony is found to be satisfactory, e.g., credible, and consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of such service.
if the veteran did not receive any of the recognized military citations which indicate combat pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) and no evidence of combat has been presented by the veteran, the Board may properly conclude that the veteran did not engage in combat and the Board is not required, pursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. § 1154(b), to accept his lay testimony as conclusive evidence of the presence of in-service stressors.
During the veterans June 1975 discharge examination, he was again psychiatrically evaluated as normal.
A review of the evidence of record indicates that the veteran was initially trained as a general warehouseman.
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
