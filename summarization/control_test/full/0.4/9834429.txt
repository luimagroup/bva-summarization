On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from August 1966 to May 1969 and from June 1974 to June 1975.
He maintains that his Vietnam experiences caused his PTSD.
if the veteran did not receive any of the recognized military citations which indicate combat pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) and no evidence of combat has been presented by the veteran, the Board may properly conclude that the veteran did not engage in combat and the Board is not required, pursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. § 1154(b), to accept his lay testimony as conclusive evidence of the presence of in-service stressors.
During the veterans June 1975 discharge examination, he was again psychiatrically evaluated as normal.
Records from the Wyoming State Hospital in August 1983 reflect diagnoses of alcohol dependence, amphetamine or similarly acting sympathomimetic dependence, cocaine abuse, and antisocial personality.
He was unclear as to the specific circumstances surrounding his stressful experiences.
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
