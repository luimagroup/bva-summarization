On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for hypertension to include as secondary to head/neck trauma and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from October 1973 to October 1993.
The Board observes that the September 2008 Board remand requested that the Veteran be provided with a VA examination and opinion addressing the question of whether it is more likely than not, at least as likely as no or less likely than not (i.e., probability less than 50 percent) that the Veteran's service-connected residuals of head trauma or PTSD caused or aggravated his hypertension.
Thus, a remand is also necessary in order for the examiner to provide a rationale for his opinions.
If the examiner who conducted the December 2008 VA examination is unavailable, then the RO should provide the Veteran with a VA examination from a cardiologist or hypertensionologist to determine the etiology of the Veteran's hypertension.
All indicated evaluations, studies, and tests deemed necessary should be accomplished and all findings reported in detail.
The examiner should include a rationale for his or her conclusions and confirm that the claims file was available for review.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.
