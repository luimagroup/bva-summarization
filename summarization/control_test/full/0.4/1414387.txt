On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in New Orleans, Louisiana.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active military service from February 1953 to December 1954.
In April 2013, the record contained records from the Houma VA Outpatient Clinic, but they only covered a period up to 2008.
Importantly, the Veteran's attorney has not submitted these records himself (an effort that could have greatly reduced the delay in the full adjudication of this case given the Veteran's age and the fact that the JMR was in October 20013).
Then, schedule the Veteran for a comprehensive VA psychiatric examination to obtain a current diagnosis including the severity of the Veteran's PTSD (if any), and to determine the nature and etiology of such diagnosis.
Whether it is at least as likely as not (a 50% or greater chance) that the Veteran currently suffers from PTSD related to his fear of hostile military or terrorist activity while on active duty, and whether it is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD.
If PTSD is found, the event that caused the PTSD should be clearly stated in order that a factual determination may be made regarding the authenticity of the event or events cited by the examiner.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
