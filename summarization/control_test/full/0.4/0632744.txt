On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in No. Little Rock, Arkansas.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active service from April 1965 until May 1970.
The evidence does not establish that the veteran participated in combat with the enemy.
The veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD; however, the veteran's in-service stressor has not been verified by objective evidence.
Here, the Board finds that any defect with respect to the timing of the VCAA notice was harmless error.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
