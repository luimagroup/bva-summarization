On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Jackson, Mississippi.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from August 1960 to August 1961.
PTSD was not shown to be incurred in or aggravated by the veteran's active duty service based on the evidence of record.
Initially, the Board finds that the veteran's claim is "well grounded" within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.A. ยง 5107(a) (West 1991 & Supp. 1999).
The examiner noted that the veteran presented with a rather mixed psychiatric picture.
The findings reported above fail to show a medical nexus.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
