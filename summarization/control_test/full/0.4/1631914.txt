On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Reno, Nevada.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from February 1968 to April 1970.
Thus, outstanding mental health records-to  include Prescott VAMC records dated since March 2014 , and Las Vegas VAMC records dated since April 2016-likely exist.
Hence, the AOJ should obtain  all outstanding, pertinent records of mental evaluation and/or treatment of the Veteran, following the procedures prescribed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c) as regards requests for records from Federal facilities.
The Veteran need take no action until otherwise notified, but he may furnish additional evidence and/or argument during the appropriate time frame.
This case is remanded
