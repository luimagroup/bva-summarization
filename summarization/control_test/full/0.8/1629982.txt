On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in St. Paul, Minnesota.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active service from August 1986 to May 1988.
The Veteran does not have an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, due to his service.
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONThe Veteran asserts that he has an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, due to his service.
Where the claimed stressor does not involve participation in combat and did not take place in a war zone, as in this case, there must be independent evidence to corroborate the Veteran's statement as to the occurrence of the claimed stressor.
Notwithstanding the notations in VA progress notes of "possible PTSD," or features of PTSD," which are equivocal by their terms, there is no competent evidence to show that the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD.
Accordingly, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim that the Veteran has PTSD due to his service, and that the claim must be denied.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.
