On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for claimed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran is not shown to have had combat with the enemy while serving on active duty, including during his active service in the Persian Gulf   2.
The veteran asserts that he has PTSD caused by stressful events to which he was exposed in service.
In order to establish service connection for a veteran who had no combat experience, as here, there must be independent evidence of record to corroborate the veteran's statement as to the occurrence of a claimed stressor.
With respect to the written statements by and on behalf of the veteran in support of his service connection claim, lay statements alone, including those from the veteran and his wife, are not competent evidence to establish the diagnosis of PTSD due to service.
In summary, because all of the elements required for a finding of service connection for PTSD are not shown, the preponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim.
Service connection for claimed PTSD is denied.
