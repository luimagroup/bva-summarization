On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Houston, Texas.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from June 1977 to July 1997.
However, in the December 2015 remand, the Board found that the examiner did not specifically comment on the Veteran's report of his inability to use the CPAP machine because he associates it with a gas mask, which was problematic as such raised the question of whether any of the Veteran's PTSD symptomatology aggravates his sleep apnea.
In this regard, the examiner offered opinions as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea was related to his service, and/or was caused or aggravated by his PTSD.
Subsequently, in June 2016, another VA opinion was obtained in which the examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's sleep apnea was incurred in or caused by his military service, or is proximately due to or the result of his service-connected PTSD.
However, such opinion does not specifically address the aggravation prong of secondary service connection and, while the examiner noted the Veteran's report that he is unable to use the CPAP machine because he associates it with a gas mask, she did not comment upon whether such results in the causation or aggravation of his sleep apnea.
After review of the record, please offer an addendum opinion addressing whether it at least as likely as not (i.e., a 50 percent probability or greater) that the Veteran's sleep apnea is caused OR aggravated by his PTSD.
The appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the Veteran if further action is required.
