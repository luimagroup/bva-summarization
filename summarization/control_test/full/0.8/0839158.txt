On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Louisville, Kentucky.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, mood disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as due to military sexual trauma.
The veteran served on active duty from March 1976 to November 1977.
Additionally, the RO ascertained that the veteran's alleged assailant served in the military at the same time as the veteran.
In February 2005, the veteran's mental health care provider opined that the veteran's diagnoses of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, and mood disorder were related to an in-service sexual trauma.
In this regard, the veteran alleges that his performance declined following the sexual assault and there is an opinion relating the alleged in-service sexual trauma to several of the veteran's psychiatric disabilities.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.
