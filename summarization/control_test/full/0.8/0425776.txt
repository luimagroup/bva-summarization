On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Columbia, South Carolina.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from August 1970 to February 1972, and from October 1976 to November 1978.
The veteran has produced medical evidence in the form of a letter from K. Northwall, M.D., which shows that he received a diagnosis of PTSD.
Inform the veteran that this information is necessary to obtain supportive evidence of the stressful event(s) and that failure to respond or an incomplete response may result in denial of the claim.
At his May 2004 hearing, the veteran testified that he was receiving psychiatric treatment from Dr. Northwall.  Although Dr. Northwall has submitted a letter to the VA and a single treatment record from August 2001, the veteran's complete psychiatric treatment records are not part of the claims folder.
Also, a November 2000 letter from M. Meiler, M.D., indicates that he veteran received treatment from him for the past two years for increasing difficulty sleeping and Dr. Meiler opined that it was perhaps part of PTSD.
The AMC or RO should ask the veteran to provide the specific information needed to obtain credible supporting evidence from the U.S. Armed Services Center for Unit Records Research (CURR) in accordance with
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify you if further action is required on your part.
