On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Denver, Colorado.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from September 1942 to March 1946.
The veteran claims a number of stressors said to have caused PTSD.
One stressor he testified about in his April 2005 hearing was an incident shortly after he arrived in Guam around late 1958, early 1959, when a marine gate guard shot himself in the head in close proximity to the veteran.
He indicated that this took place at the Naval Training Center on Guam.
He indicated that the only other stressful incident that took place in Guam was getting beaten up by Marines, but noted there was no report of this incident.
Thereafter, the VBA AMC should contact the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), and request copies of the records such as ships logs, duty assignments, command history, morning reports, operational reports, lessons learned statements, or any other information pertinent to the Naval training center in Guam in late 1958 early 1959, CINCPACFLT from between May 1959 to March 1960 and the U.S.S. Hull from March 1960 to around May 1961.
If the veteran further clarifies the dates of the alleged suicide by wrist cutting at Camp Smith under CINPAC and the man overboard incident during a transfer between the U.S.S. Oriskany and a supply ship, during a time when he was aboard the U.S.S. Hull, verification these incidents should also be further attempted. 4.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify you if further action is required on your part.
