On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Columbia, South Carolina.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety.
The Veteran served on active duty from August 1980 to August 1983.
By way of a July 2011 pre-adjudication letter, VA notified the Veteran of the information and evidence need to substantiate his service connection claim.
The Veteran maintains that he developed permanent psychiatric trauma as a result of that in-service stressor.
The Board also finds that the competent evidence does not show a relationship between the Veteran's service and his currently diagnosed depression and anxiety.
The Board is mindful that the Veteran asserts that he has experienced chronic psychiatric problems as a result of his service.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety, is denied.
