On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Boston, Massachusetts.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from April 1960 to March 1964.
Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, his claimed in-service stressor has been sufficiently corroborated by credible supporting evidence.
Competent and persuasive medical evidence indicates that the Veteran's current PTSD is causally related to his in-service stressor.
The Veteran contends that he suffers from PTSD as a result of his active-duty service.
After reviewing the evidence described above, the Board finds that the competent medical evidence of record indicates that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, which is related to his service.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, manifested by PTSD, is granted.
