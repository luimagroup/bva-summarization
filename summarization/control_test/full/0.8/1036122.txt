On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Waco, Texas.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), claimed as due to in-service personal assault.
The Veteran served on active duty from March 1977 to January 1978.
If a PTSD claim is based on personal assault in service, evidence from sources other than the Veteran's records may corroborate the Veteran's account of the stressor incident.
The Veteran should also be notified that in-service personal assault may be corroborated by evidence from sources other than the service records, as defined in 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.304(f)(3) (2009).
All specific examples of alternative sources of evidence listed in section 3.304(f)(3) must be included in the notification to the Veteran. The RO should also send the Veteran a new VA Form 21-0781a, Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connection for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Secondary to Personal Trauma, and request he complete it with as much specificity as possible.
An appropriate period of time should be allowed for the Veteran to respond and/or submit additional evidence.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
