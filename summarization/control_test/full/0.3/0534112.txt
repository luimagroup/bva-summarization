On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Muskogee, Oklahoma.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a chronic acquired psychiatric disability, including schizophrenia and/or post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The appellant is not a veteran, and he has never served on active duty.
He has described episodes of hazing by his classmates which he alleges occurred every night for three weeks and were witnessed by most of the individuals in his barracks.
Although the appellant and his representative have requested that VA assist them in verifying these claimed stressor events in service, they have pointed to no concrete action which VA could take in this regard.
Then, the appellant should be scheduled for a VA psychiatric examination (preferably by a psychiatrist) to determine the current psychiatric diagnosis(es) and its(their) relationship, if any, to the appellant's non-active-duty service.
Any indicated studies must be performed, and the claims file, including a copy of this remand, must be made available to and pertinent documents therein reviewed by the examiner.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify you if further action is required on your part.
