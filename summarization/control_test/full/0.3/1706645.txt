On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Houston, Texas.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from June 1977 to July 1997.
She further stated that she was not aware of any evidence based medical literature that substantiates a claim that PTSD permanently worsened or aggravated sleep apnea.
However, in the December 2015 remand, the Board found that the examiner did not specifically comment on the Veteran's report of his inability to use the CPAP machine because he associates it with a gas mask, which was problematic as such raised the question of whether any of the Veteran's PTSD symptomatology aggravates his sleep apnea.
Therefore, another remand is necessary in order to obtain an addendum opinion addressing such inquiries.
If the June 2016 examiner is unavailable, the record should be provided to an appropriate medical professional to render the requested opinion.
If the claim remains denied, the Veteran and his representative should be issued a supplemental statement of the case.
The appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the Veteran if further action is required.
