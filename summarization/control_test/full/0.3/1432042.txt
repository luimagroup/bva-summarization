On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Houston, Texas.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active military service from June 1965 to August 1972, including two tours of duty in the Republic of Vietnam.
The Veteran's main contention was that he did not know what to say during the examination.
He also stated that his nerves bothered him in the morning but did not feel like he was too anxious most of the day.
Furthermore, the examiner remarked that the traumatic event is not persistently re-experienced and there was no persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma or numbing of general responsiveness.
Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran has PTSD or that any depressive or anxiety symptoms he does have are related to his military service.
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.
