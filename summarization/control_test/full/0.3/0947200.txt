The Veteran served on active duty from September 1967 to May 1969.
The base camp responded that there were no planned exercises by the U.S. Navy and that they should "dig in, get under trucks, dig holes, and ammunition was passed out."
Nonetheless, the Veteran indicated that he had been fearful for his life and had had repeated nightmares of the incident for the past 30 years.
The AMC should submit another request to the JSRRC requesting it verify whether the Veteran's unit, the 226th Signal Company stationed in the Republic of Korea, at some time between September 1, 1968 through November 30, 1968, was placed on heightened alert as a result of a possible sighting of a large number of enemy ships offshore.

Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
