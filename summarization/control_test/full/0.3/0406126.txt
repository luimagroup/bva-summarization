On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Roanoke, Virginia.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for psychiatric disability, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The appellant served on active duty from June to December 1975.
Unfortunately, the VA examiner in April 2003 did not provide the requested opinion concerning the etiology of the appellant's diagnosed dysthymic disorder, and more specifically whether that acquired psychiatric disability is etiologically related to the appellant's military service.
After all appropriate development has been completed, the RO should return the claims files to the VA psychiatrist who examined the appellant in April 2003.
it is likely, less likely than not, or as likely as not that the veteran's dysthymic disorder is etiologically related to the his military service.
A diagnosis of PTSD under the DSM-IV criteria should be made or ruled out.
Accordingly, this appeal is remanded to the RO (via the Appeals Management Center in Washington, D.C.) for the following further actions:  1.
