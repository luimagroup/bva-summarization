On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Seattle, Washington.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), and major depressive disorder.
The Veteran had active service from October 1959 to April 1960, November 1961 to August 1962, April 1964 to February 1974.
The Veteran contends that he suffers from PTSD which is due to his experiences in service.
He reported his mother and niece died in a house fire then, causing depression to set in.
A July 2007 VA psychiatry note notes he had been thinking more about Vietnam since his mother's death; sometimes the memories caught him unaware.
The examiner diagnosed residuals, including anxiety disorder NOS, and opined it was at as likely as not incurred in service.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD with anxiety disorder NOS and major depressive disorder in remission, is granted
