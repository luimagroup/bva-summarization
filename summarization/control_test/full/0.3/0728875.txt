On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Waco, Texas.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from November 1971 until August 1975.
Collectively, the VCAA letters notified the veteran of what information and evidence is needed to substantiate his claim of service connection for PTSD, as well as what information and evidence must be submitted by the claimant, what information and evidence will be obtained by VA, and the need for the claimant to submit any evidence in his possession that pertains to the claim.
Despite initial inadequate notice provided to the veteran, the Board finds no prejudice to him in proceeding with the issuance of a final decision.
The Board also finds that VA has complied with all assistance provisions of VCAA.
For all the foregoing reasons, the Board concludes that VA's duties to the veteran have been fulfilled with respect to the issue on appeal.
If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.
If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
Because the record does not persuasively show participation in combat, the claimed stressors must be corroborated.
He did not provide any further information with regard to any claimed stressors.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
