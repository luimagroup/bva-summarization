On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Columbia, South Carolina.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include a bipolar disorder with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) traits or alternatively PTSD.
The appellant served on active duty from July 1968 to January 1969, and from June 1969 to October 1970.
Since the VA has been given notice that the veteran is in receipt of SSA benefits, those records must be obtained and associated in the claims folder.
When requesting those records, the RO should make sure that it uses the veteran's current full name and the name he was known thereby while in the US Navy.
He should be informed that, without such details, an adequate search for verifying information cannot be conducted.
The RO must specifically render a finding as to whether the record establishes the existence of a stressor or stressors.
Accordingly, further appellate consideration will be deferred and this case is REMANDED to the RO for the following actions:1.
