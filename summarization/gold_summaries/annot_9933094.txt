#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for arrhythmia, claimed as secondary to medication prescribed as treatment for post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran served on active duty from January 1965 to November 1967.

#Procedural History#
This appeal arises before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a November 1997 rating decision of the Salt Lake City, Utah, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), in which service connection was denied for a cardiac condition claimed as secondary to service- connected PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
The evidence shows that the veteran continued to experience arrhythmia and associated symptomatology (such as palpitations and chest pain) well after Nardil had been discontinued as treatment for his service-connected PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
In the opinion of the VA examiner, the etiology of the veteran's arrhythmia is unclear, and there is no medical or evidence which suggests an etiological relationship between Nardil and the intermittent atrial arrhythmia from which the veteran currently suffers.

#Reasoning#
The preponderance of the available evidence weighs against a finding that the veteran's currently manifested arrhythmia is proximately due to or the result of medication prescribed as treatment for PTSD.

#Outcome#
Service connection is denied for arrhythmia, claimed as secondary to medications prescribed as treatment for service-connected PTSD.
