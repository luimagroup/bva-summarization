#Procedural History#
On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Winston-Salem, North Carolina

#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for claimed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The evidence on file indicates that the veteran served on active military duty from January 1976 to December 1978 and from January 1980 to July 1992.

#Evidential Support#
Subsequent VA and private treatment records show continued psychiatric problems, including several diagnoses of PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
The veteran's stressors are reported as those of seeing civilians beheaded, recovering Iraqi bodies, witnessing a soldier being blown up by a booby-trapped AK-47, and being in Saudi Arabia when there was a breach of security.

#Reasoning#
Thus, the Board finds that the veteran is unable to provide any specific information to aid in verification of his service stressors, including the names and units of any person whom he witnessed or knew who was either injured or killed.

#Reasoning#
Because the veteran has not provided sufficient evidence of service stressors that can be verified, all of the elements needed to support a diagnosis of PTSD have not been shown in this case.

#Outcome#
Service connection for claimed PTSD is denied.
