#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran served on active duty from November 1968 to April 1971.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) on appeal from a March 1997 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in St. Petersburg, Florida (the RO).

#Reasoning#
Although the veteran himself contends that he has PTSD, it is now well-established that as a layperson without medical training he is not qualified to render medical opinions regarding the diagnosis of disorders and disabilities, and his opinion is entitled to no weight.

#Outcome#
The claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
