#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty from April 1960 to March 1964.

#Procedural History#
This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a February 2008 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Louis, Missouri, with jurisdiction later transferred to the RO in Boston, Massachusetts.

#Evidential Support#
The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD and opined that the reported Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape training was a contributing stressor.

#Evidential Support#
The examiner noted that the reported prisoner-of-war simulation was the Veteran's most troubling memory, and that his psychiatric symptoms included distressing recollections of the event and persistent avoidance of thoughts about the trauma.

#Reasoning#
After reviewing the evidence described above, the Board finds that the competent medical evidence of record indicates that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, which is related to his service.

#Evidential Support#
The Veteran has provided consistent written lay statements and hearing testimony describing the traumatic experience, and there is nothing in the record to contradict these assertions or that would indicate that the Veteran is not credible.

#Outcome#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, manifested by PTSD, is granted.
