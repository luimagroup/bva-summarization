#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for chronic ischemic heart disease secondary to service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran had active military service from May 1966 to November 1968.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2006 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Louisville, Kentucky.

#Evidential Support#
The RO denied the Veteran's claim on the basis that there was no evidence of record to suggest an etiological link between any current heart disability and his service-connected PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
Although it appears that the February 2006 VA examiner attempted to conduct evaluation of the Veteran's physical condition at the time, the Board notes that the VA examiner did not provide an adequate opinion as to whether the Veteran's currently diagnosed chronic ischemic heart disease was caused or worsened by his service-connected PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
Because the VA examiner did not provide a well-reasoned medical nexus opinion concerning a direct relationship between the Veteran's current heart disease and PTSD, the Board finds that the February 2006 VA medical opinion is inadequate for VA purposes.

#Reasoning#
In light of the above considerations, the Board concludes that another medical examination and opinion are needed.

#Reasoning#
Specifically, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) must arrange for the Veteran to undergo VA examination by a qualified health professional, who must review the Veteran's claims file and his assertions and offer a well-reasoned etiological opinion as to whether the Veteran's PTSD caused his chronic ischemic heart disease or, if not the cause, has made it worse.

#Outcome#
In view of the foregoing, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
