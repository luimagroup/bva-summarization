#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty from October 1969 to April 1972.

#Procedural History#
This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2004 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Atlanta, Georgia.

#Outcome#
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.

#Evidential Support#
The first examination, from October 2007, gives a detailed account of the Veteran's medical, social, and employment histories as well as a mental status evaluation.

#Evidential Support#
Noting the varying diagnosis that the Veteran has been given throughout his course of treatment, including findings of a significant personality disorder and possible malingering, the examiner deferred diagnosis in the absence of psychological testing.

#Evidential Support#
The examination report does not provide a clear opinion on the role that the Veteran's personality disorder or substance abuse may have played in the exaggeration or manifestation of PTSD symptoms.

#Reasoning#
Given the findings reached during the first VA examination, as well as the reservations expressed in the report of the January 2008 VA examination as to the validity of the diagnosis, the Board finds that a new VA examination is required in order to clearly determine (1) whether the Veteran has PTSD, and (2) if yes, whether the Veteran's PTSD may be attributable to verified, in-service stressors.
