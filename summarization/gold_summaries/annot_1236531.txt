#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychological disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and panic disorder.

#Service History#
The Veteran had active duty service from October 1978 to May 1979 and January 1983 to June 1983.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2006 and November 2007 rating decisions by the Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in Denver, Colorado, that denied service connection for PTSD and for generalized anxiety disorder, major depression, and a panic disorder, respectively.

#Evidential Support#
The Veteran's treating psychiatrist submitted a May 2007 letter.

#Evidential Support#
He indicated that she had PTSD due military sexual trauma.

#Reasoning#
However, the June 2006 VA psychiatric examination and May 2007 treating psychiatrist's letter are competent medical evidence that the Veteran currently has PTSD due to the in-service sexual assaults.

#Reasoning#
In summary, the record contains credible evidence of in-service sexual assaults and competent medical evidence showing that the Veteran's current symptoms meet the PTSD diagnostic criteria and are related to the reported in-service sexual assault stressors.

#Outcome#
Service connection for an acquired psychological disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and panic disorder is granted.
