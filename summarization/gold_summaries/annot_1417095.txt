#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty from February 1971 to January 1975.

#Procedural History#
Procedurally, the claims for service connection for PTSD and service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD were before the Board in May 2012.

#Procedural History#
The Veteran appealed the denial of service connection for PTSD to the Veterans Claims Court. In August 2013, the Court Clerk granted a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR), vacating the Board's May 2012 decision on PTSD and remanded the issue to the Board for additional development.

#Reasoning#
The claim for PTSD remained on appeal because separately diagnosed psychiatric conditions, such as PTSD and acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD (namely depressive disorder) here, can be service-connected. See Amberman v. Shinseki, 570 F.3d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2009)

#Evidential Support#
Upon review of the record, there is no indication that the RO or the U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) or its associate agencies contacted the CIA for any relevant information it may have regarding the Veteran and his reported military activities.

#Outcome#
the case is REMANDED
