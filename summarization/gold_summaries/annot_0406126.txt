#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for psychiatric disability, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The appellant served on active duty from June to December 1975.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 1990 rating determination by the Roanoke, Virginia, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

#Evidential Support#
A comprehensive psychiatric examination and evaluation by a VA staff psychiatrist in April 2003 resulted in the medical opinion that the appellant does not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, but rather currently suffers from alcohol dependence, polysubstance abuse, antisocial and borderline personality disorders, and a history of depressive disorder, with a working diagnosis of dysthymic disorder.

#Reasoning#
Unfortunately, the VA examiner in April 2003 did not provide the requested opinion concerning the etiology of the appellant's diagnosed dysthymic disorder, and more specifically whether that acquired psychiatric disability is etiologically related to the appellant's military service.

#Outcome#
Accordingly, this appeal is remanded to the RO (via the Appeals Management Center in Washington, D.C.) for the following further actions

#Reasoning#
The psychiatrist should be requested to provide an addendum addressing any pertinent evidence received since his completion of the examination report and also providing an opinion as to whether it is likely, less likely than not, or as likely as not that the veteran's dysthymic disorder is etiologically related to the his military service.

#Reasoning#
If the April 2003 VA examiner is no longer available, the RO should schedule the appellant for another VA psychiatric examination by a psychiatrist to determine the nature and etiology of any psychiatric disorders present.
