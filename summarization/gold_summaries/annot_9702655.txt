#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for psychiatric disability, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran had active duty from November 1967 to November 1969, July 1970 to July 1973, February 1976 to January 1978 and from April 1978 to June 1980.

#Procedural History#
This matter came to the Board of Veterans� Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Louisville, Kentucky.

#Evidential Support#
The Board specified that the RO was to review all evidence on a de novo basis and adjudicate the issue of entitlement to service connection for psychiatric disability, including PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
The requested development was completed, and the RO denied the veteran�s claim on the merits.

#Evidential Support#
The Board notes that the record includes an April 1987 Social Security Administration (SSA) decision in which it was found that medical evidence established that the veteran had severe alcoholism with intermittent problems with alcoholic hallucinosis, mixed personality disorder mostly involving paranoia and anti-social features, mild mental retardation and atypical anxiety disorder in recent years.

#Reasoning#
The veteran has not submitted records relied upon by the SSA in making its recent decision, and it is the Board�s opinion that in light of Waddell v. Brown, 5 Vet.App. 454, 457 (1993), an effort should be made to obtain these records.

#Reasoning#
Although the issue here is service connection, the SSA records may include information pertinent to the claim, and they should be obtained if possible.

#Outcome#
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED to the RO
