The record reflects that VA has made reasonable efforts to notify the veteran of the information and medical evidence necessary to substantiate his service connection claim for PTSD.
The veteran was sent a letter by the RO in January 2002 which explained, among other things, the VCAA's duty to assist and what evidence was needed to substantiate his service connection claim for PTSD.
Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD.
To the extent that the veteran claims that he suffers from PTSD as a result of his in-service experiences, it is pointed out that, as a layman without proper medical training and expertise, the veteran is not competent to provide probative medical evidence on a matter such as the diagnosis or etiology of a claimed medical condition.
Therefore, as with the veteran's assertions regarding his alleged in-service stressors, the Board also cannot assign any weight to the veteran's lay assertions of PTSD.
