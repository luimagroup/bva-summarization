In addition, the Board notes that the Veteran has not been provided a VA examination in connection with his claim for PTSD.
Furthermore, despite VA treatment records indicating that the Veteran is diagnosed with multiple psychiatric diagnoses, including PTSD, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran as having a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury only.
Send the Veteran a VA Form 21-0781 (statement in support of claim for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) and request that he provide the specific details about the claimed stressors associated with his PTSD.
For each disorder identified other than PTSD, the examiner must state whether it is at least as likely as not (a 50 percent or greater probability) that the disorder manifested in or is otherwise related to the Veteran's military service, including as a result of his reported in-service stressors.
With respect to PTSD, the AOJ must provide the examiner with a summary of any verified in-service stressors and instruct the examiner that only these events and any stressors related to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity may be considered for the purpose of determining whether exposure to an in-service stressor has resulted in PTSD.
