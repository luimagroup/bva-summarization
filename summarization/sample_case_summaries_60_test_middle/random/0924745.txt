This letter noted that the Veteran's statement received in February 2008 did not provide VA with sufficiently detailed information.
However, the May 2008 letter made no mention of the Veteran's subsequent statement regarding his alleged in-service stressor.
The Veteran also narrowed down the time of the incident to June 1991.
The claims file must be made available to the physician designated to examine the Veteran, and the examination report should include discussion of the Veteran's documented medical history and assertions, and the information obtained during stressor development.
The expanded record should then be reviewed and it should be determined if the Veteran's claim can be granted.
