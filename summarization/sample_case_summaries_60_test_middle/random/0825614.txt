This claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.
The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.
This remand is in the nature of a preliminary order and does not constitute a decision of the Board on the merits of your appeal.
