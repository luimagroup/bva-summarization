The RO is advised that the Board is obligated by law to ensure that the RO complies with its directives, as well as those of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).
An attempt should also be made to obtain any personnel records indicating the veteran's location and duties during the period in question, not already contained in the claims folder.
The RO should then carefully review all evidence obtained pursuant to the development requested above.
If the benefit sought on appeal is not granted to the veteran's satisfaction, the RO should issue a Supplemental Statement of the Case and afford the veteran and his representative an appropriate opportunity to respond.
