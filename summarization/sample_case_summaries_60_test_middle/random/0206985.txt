This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 1990 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
Initially, the Board finds that all relevant facts have been properly developed in regard to the veteran's claim, and no further assistance is required in order to comply with the VA's statutory duty to assist him with the development of facts pertinent to his claim.
Such corroborating evidence cannot consist solely of after-the-fact medical evidence containing an opinion as to a causal relationship between PTSD and service.
The Board has first considered the question of whether the veteran has a medical diagnosis of PTSD.
A request for further information in this regard from the headquarters of the United States Marine Corps of the Department of the Navy resulted in a negative response in October 1999.
In a March 2000 lay submission, the veteran provided additional information, including the names of several other commanders and instructors.
