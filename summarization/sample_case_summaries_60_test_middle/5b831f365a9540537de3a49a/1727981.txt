The remand instructions stated that the examiner was to render an opinion as to whether the documented in-service headaches and fainting spells were manifestations of her diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder (to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety).
The examiner was also advised to address the medical literature in the October 2016 Appellate Brief suggesting that fainting and headaches can be physical symptoms of PTSD and can occur as a result of exposure to trauma and the Veteran's September 1980 in-service reports of headaches and fainting spells.
Obtain a VA addendum opinion by the same December 2016 examiner, (or another appropriate examiner if unavailable), to provide opinions as to whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent or better probability) that the Veteran's PTSD was caused by OR aggravated (i.e., permanently worsened beyond the natural progress of the disorder) by her service-connected migraine headaches.
