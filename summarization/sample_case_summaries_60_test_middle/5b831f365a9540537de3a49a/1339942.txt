Service ConnectionThe Veteran contends that he suffers from PTSD, and attributes it to exposure to traumatic events in Vietnam.
Nonetheless, even if the Veteran's stressors were to be conceded, upon thorough review of the claim file, the Board finds that the record does not support a finding that the Veteran suffers a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, at any time during the appeals period.
In light of the clinical findings of the August 2011 VA examination and the absence of favorable competent medical evidence of record showing a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.
For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, and the claim must be denied.
