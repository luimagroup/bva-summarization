The veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD is not predicated upon a verified in-service stressor.
Specifically, the RO informed the veteran that, for his claim to be granted, there would have to be evidence of PTSD based on a verified in-service stressor.
However, the evidence of record does not in any way reflect participation in combat with the enemy, and there is no evidence showing that the veteran's current diagnosis of PTSD is based upon a verified stressor from service.
As such, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
