The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
However, insufficient efforts have been made to verify the Veteran's alleged in-service stressors.

Specific reference should be made to the Veteran's April 2008 statement regarding his in-service stressors.
