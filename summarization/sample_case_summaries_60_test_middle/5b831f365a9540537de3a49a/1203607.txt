In April 2005, the RO recognized that the Veteran had been diagnosed with PTSD by some treating physicians, but denied the Veteran's claim on the basis that his stressors could not be corroborated unless he could provide more accurate information.
While the RO attempted to obtain more information from the Veteran, it is unclear whether the morning reports were actually investigated.
The Veteran has also been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, which has never been considered by the RO, despite the Veteran's statements that he has been experiencing symptoms since active duty.
Therefore, given the Veteran's statements of continuous psychiatric symptoms since active duty, a VA opinion is also necessary to consider this issue as well.
If, the Veteran provides relevant additional information related to his claimed stressors, and the stressors are of sufficient specificity, the RO should attempt to corroborate his allegations with the appropriate research facilities.
The VA examiner should determine whether any of the stressors claimed by the Veteran are related to his fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.
Thereafter, the VA examiner should confirm whether any of the claimed stressors are adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and whether the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor(s).
