The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
However, insufficient efforts have been made to verify the Veteran's alleged in-service stressors.
In a letter dated August 2008, the JSRRC coordinator made a formal finding that there was a lack of information required to corroborate the Veteran's alleged stressors.
A May 2008 letter sent to the Veteran informed him that an approximate time range of 2 months was needed to research the Veteran's stressors.
However, the May 2008 letter made no mention of the Veteran's subsequent statement regarding his alleged in-service stressor.
Specific reference should be made to the Veteran's April 2008 statement regarding his in-service stressors.
