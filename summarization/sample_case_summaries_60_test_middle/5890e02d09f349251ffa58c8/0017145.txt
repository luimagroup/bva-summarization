The veteran's claim file is believed to contain information relevant to this investigation and OIG has requested that the claims file be transferred to OIG in connection with a hearing scheduled for July 3, 2000, in the jurisdiction of the RO.
The Board is not aware of the documents contained within the claims file which are relevant to the pending investigation.
The RO should thereafter obtain any relevant reports reflecting the results of the investigation conducted by OIG and associate those reports with the claims folder.
