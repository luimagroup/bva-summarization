M. that most of the veteran's symptoms associated with PTSD were better accounted for by his longstanding depression, anxiety and personality disorder.
In February 2002, in response to the Board's request, the IME, Dr. J.E., Professor and Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at a medical school, reviewed the veteran's claims folders.
Dr. J.E. initially determined that it was reasonable to conclude from the medical evidence of record that the veteran had a "traumatic incident" when, at age 18, he accidentally shot a fellow soldier and experienced loss of rank, court-martial and transfer; that one year later the veteran was hospitalized with anxiety/depression symptoms when the diagnosis was "stress/accidental shooting" and "passive-aggressive reaction."
In response to the Board's question concerning what is the veteran's most likely current diagnosis or diagnoses, the IME concluded that on Axis I, the diagnosis is PTSD, based on the PTSD symptoms reported above and on Axis II, the diagnosis is Cluster C Personality Traits (avoidant, dependent).
Also, the veteran's personality disorder traits may have made him more vulnerable to the traumatic event.
Board concludes that the weight of competent and credible evidence supports a grant of service connection for PTSD.
