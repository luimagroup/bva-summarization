The record reflects that VA has made reasonable efforts to notify the veteran of the information and medical evidence necessary to substantiate his service connection claim for PTSD.
The veteran was sent a letter by the RO in January 2002 which explained, among other things, the VCAA's duty to assist and what evidence was needed to substantiate his service connection claim for PTSD.
Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD.
Therefore, as with the veteran's assertions regarding his alleged in-service stressors, the Board also cannot assign any weight to the veteran's lay assertions of PTSD.
