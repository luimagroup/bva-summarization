Evidence obtained in connection with the veteran's attempt to reopen his claim includes VA treatment records that include a diagnosis of PTSD as a result of the veteran's experiences in the Republic of Vietnam, information that was not previously available in July 1994.
In July 1994, the RO denied the veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD because the record did not contain a diagnosis of PTSD.
Accordingly, the Board concludes that the veteran has submitted new and material evidence to reopen his claim of service connection for PTSD.
As for whether evidence sufficient to corroborate the veteran's story of in-service stressors has been submitted, the Board notes that service personnel records show that the veteran served in the Republic of Vietnam with a combat engineer unit (27th Engineering Battalion) from December 1968 to November 1969.
