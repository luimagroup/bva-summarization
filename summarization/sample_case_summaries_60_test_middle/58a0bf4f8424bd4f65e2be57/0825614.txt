The veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for PTSD based on his combat experiences while in Vietnam, which his VA psychologist reports as including an incident in which "his landing zone was overrun," requiring the use of 'beehive rounds' of ammunition, resulting in death and dismemberment of many.
The veteran's DD-214 discharge report indicates that the veteran served a portion of his active duty in Vietnam where he served as a field artillery crewman.
His VA psychologist reports that the veteran served in Vietnam as a radioman in the 1st Cavalry Division.  (The veteran's service medical records show Vietnam service with C Battery, 2/19th Artillery, 1st Cavalry Division).
The letter sent to the veteran to inform him of the information and evidence necessary to establish his claim, indicated that his claim was for "post pragmatic syndrome" and "post pramatia syndrome," and  there is no indication veteran was ever sent a stressor identification letter.
