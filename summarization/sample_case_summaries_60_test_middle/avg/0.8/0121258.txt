Although the RO had previously attempted to verify the veteran's alleged stressors through the USASCRUR, its request to the USASCRUR did not adequately identify the veteran's claimed stressors.
If the RO is unable to obtain a copy of any records identified by the veteran, it should so inform the veteran and his representative of this and request them to provide a copy of such records.
An attempt should also be made to obtain any personnel records indicating the veteran's location and duties during the period in question, not already contained in the claims folder.
The RO should then review the file and prepare a summary of the veteran's claimed stressors, to include any additional information received from the veteran concerning his claimed stressors.
