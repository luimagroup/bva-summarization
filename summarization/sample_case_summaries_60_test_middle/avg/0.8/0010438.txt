The veteran was examined, but it was noted that his thought content dealt mostly with "description of some depressive symptomatology," although the veteran did describe having memories from Vietnam, "becoming rather depressed when he starts thinking about this, unable to sleep, and also ... irritable and sometimes losing control of his impulses."
In addition to the above, the vast majority of the multiple VA psychiatric admissions of the veteran throughout the years have included a diagnosis of PTSD.
It was noted that the veteran had attended a VA PTSD group, and that, in the subscribing physician's opinion, he was "a severely disabled veteran that is unemployable."
As clearly shown in the above discussion of the pertinent competent evidence of record, several mental health experts have said that the veteran does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, while other mental health experts, particularly those who have treated the veteran during his multiple psychiatric hospitalizations, have indicated that the veteran indeed suffers from PTSD.
The Board then finds that the evidence as to whether the veteran has PTSD or not is in relative equipoise.
