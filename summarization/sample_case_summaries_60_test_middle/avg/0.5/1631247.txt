The Board has recharacterized the claim to consider a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, to more accurately reflect the nature of the claim.
Furthermore, despite VA treatment records indicating that the Veteran is diagnosed with multiple psychiatric diagnoses, including PTSD, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran as having a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury only.
Send the Veteran a VA Form 21-0781 (statement in support of claim for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) and request that he provide the specific details about the claimed stressors associated with his PTSD.
With respect to PTSD, the AOJ must provide the examiner with a summary of any verified in-service stressors and instruct the examiner that only these events and any stressors related to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity may be considered for the purpose of determining whether exposure to an in-service stressor has resulted in PTSD.
