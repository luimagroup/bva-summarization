The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The August 2008 JSRRC report makes no mention of the Veteran's April 2008 statement.
Specific reference should be made to the Veteran's April 2008 statement regarding his in-service stressors.
The claims file must be made available to the physician designated to examine the Veteran, and the examination report should include discussion of the Veteran's documented medical history and assertions, and the information obtained during stressor development.
The examiner should be informed that only stressors or stressful conditions that have been verified by the AMC may be used as a basis for a diagnosis of PTSD.
