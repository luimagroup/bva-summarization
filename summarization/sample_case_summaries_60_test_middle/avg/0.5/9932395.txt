In July 1994, the RO denied the veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD because the record did not contain a diagnosis of PTSD.
The Board notes that, in order to grant service connection for PTSD, there must be medical evidence establishing a diagnosis of the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. ยง 4.125(a) (1999), credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred, and a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor.
In addition, at an October 1997 VA examination, after the veteran had discussed his Vietnam experiences (i.e., having engaged in firefights, being wounded by shrapnel, having a friend killed, being on a convoy that was ambushed, and seeing people killed), the examiner noted that he had read the claims file and formed an opinion that the veteran suffered from "schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type with comorbidity of [PTSD] resulting from the combat experience."
Furthermore, the Board notes that a February 1998 VA treatment record characterized the veteran's psychiatric disorder as "combat-related PTSD."
In addition, a December 1968 letter from the veteran's commander shows that the veteran was assigned to Bravo Company, 27th Engineering Battalion (combat), and his Company was stationed 12 miles south of the city of Hue, Republic of Vietnam.
Specifically, this individual was killed as a result of a rocket-propelled grenade attack while serving with the 25th Infantry Division in the Republic of Vietnam.
