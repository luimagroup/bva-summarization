Accordingly, the Veteran's claim is not limited solely to PTSD; rather, the claim is properly characterized broadly as a claim of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.
The Veteran has not referred to any additional existing evidence that is necessary for a fair adjudication of the claim which has not been obtained.
Service ConnectionThe Veteran contends that he suffers from PTSD, and attributes it to exposure to traumatic events in Vietnam.
In light of the clinical findings of the August 2011 VA examination and the absence of favorable competent medical evidence of record showing a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.
In reaching the above conclusion, the Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements that he has PTSD.
