The veteran was sent a letter by the RO in January 2002 which explained, among other things, the VCAA's duty to assist and what evidence was needed to substantiate his service connection claim for PTSD.
A review of Social Security Administration records provided by the veteran reflects that the veteran received an OHA Psychiatric Review, the results of which were contained in an OHA Psychiatric Review Technique Form and signed by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in May 1998.
During this engagement, the veteran recalled later that he was very scared, that he knew it was over, and that he hoped that he was ready to die.
In addition, service connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. ยง 4.125(a) (2002); (2) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and (3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.
Given the foregoing, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against a diagnosis of PTSD in this case.
