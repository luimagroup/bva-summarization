When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.
Dr. J.E. initially determined that it was reasonable to conclude from the medical evidence of record that the veteran had a "traumatic incident" when, at age 18, he accidentally shot a fellow soldier and experienced loss of rank, court-martial and transfer; that one year later the veteran was hospitalized with anxiety/depression symptoms when the diagnosis was "stress/accidental shooting" and "passive-aggressive reaction."
It was noted that clearly the veteran had presented a number of personality disorder traits.
The IME continued that the PTSD symptoms seem to be related to a traumatic event during service.
Thus, the Board finds that all three elements of 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.304(f) have been satisfied.
Board concludes that service connection is in order for an acquired psychiatric disability, specifically  PTSD.
