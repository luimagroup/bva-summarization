Thus, the Board finds that no prejudice accrues to the veteran in proceeding to the merits of his claim at this time.
By this, the client indicated that he meant he had to salvage through the plane to find instrumentation.
Overall, the veteran's report of stressors while serving on the USS CORAL SEA lack any indicia of reliability or credibility.
Based upon the above, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence establishes that the veteran was not engaged in combat, and that his allegations of exposure to combat and non-combat stressors are not credible.
Furthermore, there is no doubt of material fact to be resolved in the veteran's favor.
