The Veteran's PTSD and depressive disorder had its onset in service.
The July 1968 separation examination report indicates that the Veteran reported having depression or excessive worry.
A VA therapist, from the VA PTSD Clinical Team, provided a July 2016 statement noting diagnoses of persistent depressive disorder and PTSD related to combat he experienced in Vietnam.
The Board finds that the medical evidence of record supports the finding that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms are related to his in-service stressors.
Consequently, the elements necessary to establish service connection for his psychiatric disorder have been met.
