The veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for PTSD based on his combat experiences while in Vietnam, which his VA psychologist reports as including an incident in which "his landing zone was overrun," requiring the use of 'beehive rounds' of ammunition, resulting in death and dismemberment of many.
His VA psychologist reports that the veteran served in Vietnam as a radioman in the 1st Cavalry Division.  (The veteran's service medical records show Vietnam service with C Battery, 2/19th Artillery, 1st Cavalry Division).
Additionally, the current record does not reflect any meaningful effort to corroborate the veteran's claimed stressors.
The letter sent to the veteran to inform him of the information and evidence necessary to establish his claim, indicated that his claim was for "post pragmatic syndrome" and "post pramatia syndrome," and  there is no indication veteran was ever sent a stressor identification letter.
The veteran should be advised that any additional information would be helpful to obtain supportive evidence of the claimed stressors and that he should be specific as possible so that an adequate search for corroborating information can be conducted.
