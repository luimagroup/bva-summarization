The evidence of record includes a June 1979 statement from the veteran's Congressman, which indicates that the veteran served in the Army Reserves from March 1965 to March 1969.
To date, the service department has not been able to verify the veteran's alleged active duty in Vietnam.
However, for the reasons noted above, the Board concludes that additional development of the record is required prior to appellate disposition.
In addition, the RO should arrange for an exhaustive search for all service personnel records for the veteran during all periods of service, including ACDUTRA, to include military occupational specialty, decorations awarded, unit assignments and duty locations.
