Although the RO had previously attempted to verify the veteran's alleged stressors through the USASCRUR, its request to the USASCRUR did not adequately identify the veteran's claimed stressors.
An attempt should also be made to obtain any personnel records indicating the veteran's location and duties during the period in question, not already contained in the claims folder.
The RO should then carefully review all evidence obtained pursuant to the development requested above.
If PTSD is not diagnosed, the examiner should explain why the veteran does not meet the criteria for this diagnosis.
