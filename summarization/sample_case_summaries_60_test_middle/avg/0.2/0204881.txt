He described an incident where a jeep he was riding in was almost blown up by a land mine.
The claimant's assertions that he engaged in combat with the enemy are not ignored, but are evaluated along with the other evidence of record.
There is no support in his military records for his allegation that he was involved in any combat activity.
The Board is cognizant of the appellant's own statements to the effect that he experiences symptoms of PTSD that are due to stressors while in service.
He has not provided enough specific information as to the dates and places of the events and those events could not be verified.
In short, the Board finds that VA's statutory duty to inform and assist the appellant in the development of his claim has been satisfied under the circumstances presented in this case.
