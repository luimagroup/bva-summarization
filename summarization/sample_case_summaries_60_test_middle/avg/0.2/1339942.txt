Service ConnectionThe Veteran contends that he suffers from PTSD, and attributes it to exposure to traumatic events in Vietnam.
He recounts his building being hit my mortar fire, crawling to a bunker for safety, placing his hand on a large wound in a soldier's injured leg, and participating in the Tet Offensive.
In light of the clinical findings of the August 2011 VA examination and the absence of favorable competent medical evidence of record showing a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.
