The Veteran's PTSD and depressive disorder had its onset in service.
He also reported that "one of the tanks we were working with hit a mine and my [sergeant] and myself pulled the guys out of the tank that caught fire while artillery shells were going off."
The July 1968 separation examination report indicates that the Veteran reported having depression or excessive worry.
The Board finds that the medical evidence of record supports the finding that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms are related to his in-service stressors.
Consequently, the elements necessary to establish service connection for his psychiatric disorder have been met.
