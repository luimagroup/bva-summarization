Upon review of the record, the Board finds that VA has met the duty to assist and notice requirements under the VCAA.
By this, the client indicated that he meant he had to salvage through the plane to find instrumentation.
The airplane parts were not salvageable, and they blew the plane up with a grenade.
Based upon the above, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence establishes that the veteran was not engaged in combat, and that his allegations of exposure to combat and non-combat stressors are not credible.
Furthermore, there is no doubt of material fact to be resolved in the veteran's favor.
