Pursuant to the joint motion, the Board finds that further development is needed.
Specifically, he reports that while lathering his hair in the shower in June 1967, the water became scalding hot and he quickly stepped back and cleared the soap out of his eyes and saw another recruit named laughing at him.
He also indicated that he witnessed physical assaults on other recruits during basic training.
He testified that he internalized the attacks and the stress manifested itself as rashes and hives on his body.
The examiner should address the June 1968 service medical record showing that the Veteran was treated for angioneurotic edema and recurrent urticaria and prescribed Atarax for nervous problems, the August 2005 VA examiner's opinion that the Veteran's PTSD with secondary depression was related to a traumatic event during active duty, the March 2007 Vet Center opinion that the Veteran's overall military experience may have led to depression, the March 2011 VA physician's conclusion that the Veteran did not meet criterion A for PTSD, and the August 2014 private physician's opinion that the stressor involving the assault in the shower was sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD and the Veteran has PTSD due to that stressor.
