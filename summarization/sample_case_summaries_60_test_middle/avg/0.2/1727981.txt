The remand instructions stated that the examiner was to render an opinion as to whether the documented in-service headaches and fainting spells were manifestations of her diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder (to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety).
The Veteran was afforded an additional VA psychiatric evaluation in December 2016.
The examiner noted mental health diagnoses of chronic PTSD with secondary generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder.
In addition, the Veteran, through her representative, has asserted that her PTSD and depression are caused or aggravated by her service connected migraines.
If aggravation is found, then the examiner should quantify the degree of such aggravation, if possible.
