Office (RO) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Jurisdiction rests with the RO in Roanoke, Virginia, from which the Veteran's appeal was certified. The issue of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder was initially denied by the RO in a June 2011 rating decision. Thereafter, the Veteran submitted additional evidence, which was received by VA in July 2011. The additional evidence, received by VA in July 2011, included a June 2011 letter from Temple Neurology, which indicated the Veteran reported a history of PTSD and discussed the Veteran's difficulties with military life. In August 2011, the Veteran sent an application for benefits which requested his PTSD claim be reopened. In an August 2011 report of general information, which attempted to clarify the intent of the August 2011 claim to reopen entitlement to service connection for PTSD, the Veteran stated he had recently mailed new and additional evidence. In a May 2012 rating decision, the RO denied the claim to reopen entitlement to service connection for PTSD. In February 2013, the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement specific to the May 2012 rating decision. Although the Veteran did not expressly disagree with the June 2011 rating decision, but rather the May 2012 rating decision, new and material evidence was received in connection with the claim before the expiration of the appellate period of the June 2011 rating decision. Such evidence is to be considered with the claim which was pending. See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.156(b) (2013). Thus, the June 2011 rating decision is on appeal..", "1141841.txt": "On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in St. Louis, Missouri.", "1212279.txt": "On appeal from the

of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Hartford, Connecticut. Thereafter, the Veteran requested the matter be transferred to the RO in Boston, MA. The RO in Boston, MA issued a Statement of the Case (SOC) in June 2014. The Veteran, at that time, had relocated to Florida. All subsequent communications from the Veteran and his representative, to include his substantive appeal, were sent to the RO in St. Petersburg, Florida. The issue on appeal requires clarification. The Veteran originally claimed entitlement to service connection for PTSD specifically in 2011. Medical records, however, indicated varying diagnoses, to include a panic disorder with agoraphobia. The Veteran also specifically sought service connection for a panic disorder, but subsequently withdrew this claim in January 2014 indicating it was already being worked on with his current PTSD appeal. The RO, thereafter, appears to have limited the appeal to PTSD alone.

a rating decision issued in September 2009 by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Jurisdiction over the matter has subsequently been transferred to the RO in Denver, Colorado. This case was remanded in February 2016 in order to afford the Veteran her requested hearing before the Board. In March 2016, the Veteran testified at a Board video-conference hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge. A transcript of the hearing has been associated with the record. At such time, the undersigned held the record open 60 days for the receipt of additional evidence. In May 2016, the undersigned granted an extension of 60 days for the submission of such evidence. Thereafter, in July 2016, the Veteran submitted additional evidence consisting of a May 2016 private psychological evaluation with a waiver of Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) consideration. 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.1304(c) (2015). Therefore, the Board may properly consider such evidence. However, while she likewise submitted additional evidence in August 2014, she did not waive AOJ consideration of it. However, as her claim is being remanded, the AOJ will have an opportunity to review all the submitted documents such that no prejudice results to the Veteran in the Board considering such evidence for the limited purpose of issuing a comprehensive and thorough remand..", "1018488.txt": "On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in New York, New York.", "1442203.txt": "On

a March 2005 rating decision by the St. Petersburg, Florida, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The case was later transferred to the jurisdiction of the Chicago, Illinois RO. In February 2011, the Board remanded this issue to the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) for further evidentiary development. The Board's remand directed, in pertinent part, that the Veteran be scheduled for a VA examination. The examiner was asked to determine whether the Veteran's symptoms met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD in accordance with the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), and, if so, to determine whether any verified in-service stressors found to be established by the evidence of record caused his PTSD. In the event the Veteran was found to have other psychiatric diagnoses, the examiner was asked to provide an opinion as to the medical probabilities that any disorder was caused or made worse by his active service..", "0506387.txt": "On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Cleveland, Ohio.", "9906577.txt": "On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional

The Veteran and his wife testified at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge by video conference from the North Little Rock RO in May 2012.

Regional Office (RO) in Muskogee, Oklahoma, which denied service connection for PTSD because specific details of the stressor were not shown and because PTSD was not diagnosed. The Veteran submitted a statement identifying additional stressors and details in March 2007. Although the RO accepted the Veteran's statement as a new claim for benefits, because the Veteran identified additional stressors and details and submitted the statement within one year of the November 2006 rating decision denying his claim for benefits, the Veteran's March 2007 is not final as new and material evidence was received. See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.156(b) (2011); see also Shade v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 110 (2010) (new and material evidence is not required as to each previously unproven element of a claim). The Veteran requested a hearing before the Board when he submitted his substantive appeal in February 2010. In correspondence dated in August 2010, the Veteran was advised that he was scheduled for a hearing at the Board in January 2011. In a January 2011 statement, the Veteran indicated that he no longer desired a hearing before the Board..", "0311415.txt": "On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in

Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2008 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Cleveland, Ohio (via a \"Tiger Team\" expedited decision), which denied service connection for PTSD. The appeal is currently in the jurisdiction of the Jackson, Mississippi RO. The RO adjudicated the Veteran's claim as the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD; however, a claim for a specific psychiatric disability such as PTSD encompasses a claim in general for any psychiatric disorder. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (holding that claims for service connection specifically for a psychiatric disability of PTSD encompass claims for service connection for all psychiatric disabilities; an appellant generally is not competent to diagnose his mental condition, he is only competent to identify and explain the symptoms that he observes and experiences). Thus the proper claim on appeal is for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.

The case was later transferred to the jurisdiction of the RO in Muskogee, Oklahoma, which certified the appeal and transferred the case to the Board. The Veteran's claim was adjudicated at the RO as a claim of service connection for PTSD, based on the Veteran's original claim. The issue has been characterized to reflect that claims for service connection specifically for a psychiatric disability of PTSD encompass claims for service connection for all psychiatric disabilities, as an appellant generally is not competent to diagnose his mental condition, he is only competent to identify and explain the symptoms that he observes and experiences.

(Board) on appeal from a July 2009 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Denver, Colorado. Jurisdiction rests with the VA RO in Reno, Nevada, from which the appeal was certified. The Board previously characterized the issue as entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than panic attacks, anxiety, and major depression, to include PTSD. However, the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any psychiatric disorder that may reasonably be encompassed by a veteran's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record. Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009). Upon review of the evidence, the Board finds the Veteran's psychiatric claims have consistently involved similar symptoms and have been based on the same in-service event. Therefore, the Board has re-captioned the Veteran's claim as shown on the title page in the manner most beneficial to the Veteran.

In January 2012, the Board remanded the case for additional evidentiary and procedural development. Review of the record indicates substantial compliance with the remand orders. See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998). The January 2012 Remand also included the issue of service connection for a pilonidal cyst. Following the Board's requested development, service connection for status-post pilonidal cyst surgery was granted in a November 2012 rating decision.
