WITNESS AT HEARING ON APPEAL

Appellant


ATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD

T. Mainelli, Counsel
INTRODUCTION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1966 to May 1969 and from October 1990 to May 1991.  He was recalled to active duty from March 1992 to August 1992.  His overseas tours included service in Vietnam and Kuwait. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2005 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Columbia, South Carolina, which denied service connection for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with CHF.

The Veteran testified at a personal hearing in a June 2008 videoconference hearing before a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) who is no longer employed by the Board.  A transcript of the hearing is contained in the record. 

The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.


REMAND

In June 2008, the Veteran provided testimony before a VLJ who is no longer employed at the Board.  In a statement received in April 2012, the Veteran indicated his desire to appear at a Travel Board hearing before a VLJ who will finally decide his case.  Accordingly, the case must be returned to the RO to schedule such a hearing.  38 U.S.C.A. § 7107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.75, 19.76, 20.703, 20.704.

Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:

The RO should schedule the Veteran for a Travel Board hearing in the order that the request was received.  After a hearing is conducted, or if the Veteran withdraws his hearing request or fails to report for the scheduled hearing, the claims file should be returned to the Board for appellate review.

The appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).

This claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2011).
