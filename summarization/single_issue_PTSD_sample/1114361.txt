WITNESSES AT HEARING ON APPEAL

Appellant and his wife


ATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD

T. Sherrard, Associate Counsel

INTRODUCTION

The Veteran had active service from May 1966 to May 1968.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) from an October 2006 rating decision by the above Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that denied entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  

The Veteran and his wife provided testimony at an August 2009 Travel Board hearing before the undersigned at the RO.  A transcript is associated with the claims folder.

Pursuant to Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009), in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that claims for service connection for PTSD should be considered to include claims for service connection for all psychiatric disabilities, the Board remanded the claim for a VA examination to determine whether there were any additional psychiatric diagnoses that could be related to active service.  The development requested by the Board in its October 2009 decision has been completed, as discussed below, and the claim is now appropriate for appellate review.    

The Board notes that, subsequent to its October 2009 remand, service connection for PTSD was granted in a December 2010 rating decision, and thus, the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD is not before us.  


FINDINGS OF FACT

The competent and probative medical evidence of record preponderates against a finding that the Veteran's depression and dementia are related to active service; nor was a psychotic disorder manifested within one year after her separation from active service.


CONCLUSION OF LAW

A mental disorder other than PTSD, including depression and dementia, was not incurred in or aggravated by active service, nor may it be presumed to have been so incurred.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1137, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107(b) (West 2002 & Supp. 2010); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.384 (2010). 


REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

I.  Duty to Notify and Assist

The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) enhanced VA's duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating their claims for VA benefits, as codified in pertinent part at 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2010); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.326(a) (2010).

Upon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application for benefits, VA is required to notify the claimant and his representative of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  Proper notice from VA must inform the claimant of any information and evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide, in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b)(1) (2010).  This notice must be provided prior to an initial unfavorable decision on a claim by the RO.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004).  In addition, the decision of the Court in Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006) requires more extensive notice in claims for compensation, e.g., as to potential downstream issues such as disability rating and effective date.  

If complete notice is not provided until after the initial adjudication, such a timing error can be cured by subsequent legally adequate VCAA notice, followed by readjudication of the claim, as in a Statement of the Case (SOC) or Supplemental SOC (SSOC).  Moreover, where there is an uncured timing defect in the notice, subsequent action by the RO which provides the claimant a meaningful opportunity to participate in the processing of the claim can prevent any such defect from being prejudicial.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 499 F.3d 1317, 1323-24 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Prickett v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 370, 376 (2006).

The U.S. Supreme Court has held that an error in VCAA notice should not be presumed prejudicial, and that the burden of showing harmful error rests with the party raising the issue, to be determined on a case-by-case basis.  Shinseki v. Sanders, 129 S. Ct. 1696 (2009).  In this case, the appellant has not demonstrated any prejudicial or harmful error in VCAA notice, nor, as discussed below, has the Board identified any.

In April 2006, VA sent the Veteran a letter informing him of the types of evidence needed to substantiate his claim and its duty to assist him in substantiating his claim under the VCAA.  The letter informed the Veteran that VA would assist him in obtaining evidence necessary to support his claim, such as medical records, employment records, or records from other Federal agencies.  He was advised that it is his responsibility to provide or identify, and furnish authorization where necessary for the RO to obtain, any supportive evidence pertinent to his claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b)(1).  Although no longer required, the appellant was also asked to submit evidence and/or information in his possession to the RO.  In addition, the letter described how VA calculates disability ratings and effective dates.  

The Board finds that the contents of the April 2006 letter satisfied the requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b) regarding VA's duty to notify and assist, including the requirements set forth by the Court in Dingess, supra.  In addition, the January 2011 SSOC explained the basis for the RO's action and provided him with an additional 60-day period to submit more evidence. 

Thus, it appears that all obtainable evidence identified by the Veteran relative to his claim has been obtained and associated with the claims file, and that neither he nor his representative has identified any other pertinent evidence, not already of record, which would need to be obtained for a fair disposition of this appeal.  

It is the Board's conclusion that the Veteran has been provided with every opportunity to submit evidence and argument in support of his claim, and to respond to VA notices.  

With regard to VA's duty to assist, VA obtained the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) and treatment records from the Huntington VA Medical Center (VAMC).  As mentioned above, in an October 2009 decision, the Board remanded the claim for further development.  Specifically, the Board stated that a VA examination was needed to obtain a medical opinion regarding whether there were any psychiatric diagnoses other than PTSD and if so, whether a nexus existed between those diagnoses and active service.     

Following the Board's remand, a VA examination was conducted in March 2010 that included a thorough psychiatric evaluation and an opinion regarding whether his other psychiatric diagnoses were related to service.  Thus, it appears that all development requested by this Board in its October 2009 remand has been completed to the extent possible, and no additional development is required.   

Accordingly, we find that VA has satisfied its duty to assist the Veteran in apprising him as to the evidence needed, and in obtaining evidence pertinent to his claim under the VCAA.  Therefore, no useful purpose would be served in remanding this matter for yet more development.  Such a remand would result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA, with no additional benefits flowing to the Veteran.  The Court of Appeals for Veteran Claims has held that such remands are to be avoided.  See Soyini v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 (1991); Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).

II.  Service Connection

A.  Applicable Law

Service connection may be granted for disability which is the result of disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. § 1110 (West 2002 & Supp. 2010); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) (2010).

Where there is a chronic disease shown as such in service or within the presumptive period under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 so as to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.  This rule does not mean that any manifestation in service will permit service connection.  To show chronic disease in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word "chronic."  When the disease identity is established, there is no requirement of evidentiary showing of continuity.  When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, then a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

Service connection may be granted for disease that is diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C.A. § 1113(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held that, in order to prevail on the issue of service connection, there must be:  (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury.  Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).

In addition, the law provides that, where a veteran served ninety days or more of active military service, and certain chronic diseases, such as psychoses (defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.384), become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year after the date of separation from such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).  While the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time.  Id.

It is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record on appeal.  See 38 U.S.C.A. § 7104(a).  When there is an approximate balance in the evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

In Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that an appellant need only demonstrate that there is an "approximate balance of positive and negative evidence" in order to prevail.  The Court has also stated, "It is clear that to deny a claim on its merits, the evidence must preponderate against the claim."  Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996), citing Gilbert.

B.  Facts and Analysis
 
In a March 2011 Written Argument, the Veteran's representative contends that the Veteran's currently diagnosed dementia and major depression are related to active service.  

His STRs are negative for any manifestations of mental health or cognitive disorders.  Both the July 1965 induction and April 1968 separation examinations reports reflect a normal psychiatric evaluation.

Following separation from service, he was diagnosed with depression and memory loss at the Huntington VAMC in December 2005.  In this regard, the Board notes that evidence of a prolonged period without medical complaint or treatment, and the amount of time which has elapsed since military service, can be considered as evidence against the claim.  Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  He refused antidepressant medication at the time.  He was referred to neurology for additional evaluation of his memory loss.  

At a subsequent mental health evaluation in January 2006, the examining social worker assessed "rule out" dementia; a diagnosis of dementia was subsequently confirmed as in March 2006, and later clarified to be parieto-temporal dementia.  

A November 2006 treatment note indicates MRI scans of the brain and an electroencephalography were normal.  

In January 2008, the Veteran said, with regard to his depression, that he had good days and bad days, and that bad days were usually related to his family.  His dementia was an issue for his family.  

In January 2009, the Veteran reported an increase in both his depression and dementia.  He continued treatment for both conditions at the VAMC, and none of his providers offered an opinion as to the etiology of the disorders.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2010.  A collateral interview of his wife was conducted as part of the examination, and the examiner reviewed the claims file.  When asked what his current mental health concerns were, the Veteran said he was most bothered by his loss of cognitive functioning and inability to work.  He expressed feelings of worthlessness and guilt related to his cognitive problems, and hopelessness secondary to his memory problems.  The examiner stated that the symptoms of depression, including sadness, anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, and indecisiveness, had increased as his dementia progressed, and were at a moderate level of severity.  Moreover, his depressive symptoms were not assessed as associated with his PTSD symptoms, but rather were associated with his declining cognitive functioning.  The examiner assessed major depressive disorder, in partial remission, and dementia not otherwise specified.  Although his PTSD symptoms caused moderate psychological distress, the examiner opined that his dementia was the source of his depression and the majority of his functional impairments, noting that the Veteran and his wife quite clearly stated that his depressive symptoms began in reaction to his cognitive decline.  Moreover, the examiner opined that both the dementia and depression were not related to active military service.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a grant of service connection for a mental disorder other than PTSD, to include depression and dementia.  

First, the Board finds that the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a) as to y psychotic disorder do not apply here.  The first diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder was documented more than a year after the Veteran's separation from service, and there is no record of complaints during the first post-service year.  Moreover, depression and dementia do not meet the definition of a psychotic disorder as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.384.  

Next, continuity of the disorder has not been established by the evidence.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to give evidence about what he experienced; for example, he is competent to discuss his current sadness, memory problems, and other experienced symptoms.  See, e.g., Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994).  Moreover, the Federal Circuit Court has held that in certain situations, lay evidence can even be sufficient with respect to establishing medical matters such as a diagnosis.  Specifically, in Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007), the Federal Circuit commented that competence to establish a diagnosis of a condition can exist when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  See also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (2009) (noting that a layperson may comment on lay-observable symptoms).

Similarly, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held that, when a condition may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features, the presence of the disorder is not a determination "medical in nature" and is capable of lay observation.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  Furthermore, lay evidence concerning continuity of symptoms after service, if credible, is ultimately competent, regardless of the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  However, the resolution of issues which involve medical knowledge, such as the diagnosis of a disability and the determination of medical etiology, requires professional evidence.  See Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 495 (1992).  

In the present case, the Veteran's sadness, memory problems, and other symptoms are found to be capable of lay observation, and thus his statements constitute competent evidence.  The Board must now consider the credibility of such evidence.  The Veteran's service records show no evidence of any mental disorder or dementia in active service.  Following service, there was no documentation of complaints or treatment for depression or dementia until 2005, 37 years after his separation from service.  While he appears to be sincere in his belief as to service connection, in light of these factors, the Veteran's current statements to the effect that he has experienced continuous symptomatology since active service, while competent, are not deemed to be credible.  Therefore, the absence of documented complaints or treatment for nearly four decades following his military discharge is more probative than his current recollection as to symptoms experienced in the distant past.  See Curry v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 59 (1994).  Moreover, there are no competent opinions relating either the depression or dementia to military service.  Indeed, the only competent nexus opinion is unfavorable.  Accordingly, continuity of symptomatology is not established by either the competent evidence or the Veteran's own statements.

In conclusion, the evidence of record is against a grant of service connection for a mental disorder other than PTSD, to include depression and dementia.  As the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 54-56 (1990).



ORDER

Service connection for a mental disorder other than PTSD, to include depression and dementia, is denied.
