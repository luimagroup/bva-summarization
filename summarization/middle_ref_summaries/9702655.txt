The Board specified that the RO was to review all evidence on a de novo basis and adjudicate the issue of entitlement to service connection for psychiatric disability, including PTSD.
The requested development was completed, and the RO denied the veteran�s claim on the merits.
The Board notes that the record includes an April 1987 Social Security Administration (SSA) decision in which it was found that medical evidence established that the veteran had severe alcoholism with intermittent problems with alcoholic hallucinosis, mixed personality disorder mostly involving paranoia and anti-social features, mild mental retardation and atypical anxiety disorder in recent years.
The veteran has not submitted records relied upon by the SSA in making its recent decision, and it is the Board�s opinion that in light of Waddell v. Brown, 5 Vet.App. 454, 457 (1993), an effort should be made to obtain these records.
Although the issue here is service connection, the SSA records may include information pertinent to the claim, and they should be obtained if possible.
