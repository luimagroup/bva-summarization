The July 2009 VA psychiatrists were provided an opportunity to elaborate on why they felt that Veteran showed no symptoms of re-experiencing the traumatic event.
As the July 2009 VA psychiatrists did not provide a complete rationale with respect to their opinion that the Veteran did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD, the Board cannot accept their opinion as competent.
The record reflects verified in-service stressor events related to the Veteran's combat experiences.
As noted above, in-service stressors which have been verified include being fired upon and sharing one foxhole barely large enough for 2 people with 15 people and witnessing soldiers operating a front loader and throwing dead bodies into a ditch.
Although medical professional disagree as to whether a diagnosis of PTSD is appropriate, the Veteran's treating psychiatric professionals endorse a finding of PTSD associated with the verified combat stressors.
Therefore, resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, a diagnosis of PTSD is established.
