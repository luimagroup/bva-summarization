The claims file includes medical evidence showing a current diagnosis of PTSD.
It appears that the RO has denied the veteran�s claim because of a lack of a verified stressor in service.
In view of the foregoing, it is the Board�s judgment that the RO should obtain additional information from the veteran regarding his alleged in-service stressors and forward this information to the USASCRUR for verification of the stressors.
If, and only if, the RO determines that the record establishes the existence of a stressor or stressors, then the RO should arrange for the veteran to be accorded a VA psychiatric examination to determine the diagnosis of all psychiatric disorders that are present.
