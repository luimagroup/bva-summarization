The December 2014 Board remand instructed the AOJ to schedule the Veteran for a VA psychological examination to determine the nature and etiology of his claimed mental disorder.
A review of the record reveals that the Veteran missed his examination due to a medical emergency. The Veteran has requested that the examination be rescheduled.
As the Veteran has presented good cause for his failure to appear at the examination, his request will be granted and another mental health examination should be scheduled in compliance with the Board's initial remand directives.
