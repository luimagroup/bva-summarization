The record shows that the Veteran has a diagnosis of recurring depressive disorder.
The "negative" evidence regarding a diagnosis of PTSD consists of opinions by VA psychologists in October 2010 (that the CMC stressor did not qualify as a tramatic event) and January 2012 (that the CMC stressor qualified as a traumatic event; however, there was no persistent reexperiencing of the event or persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma or numbing of general responsiveness).
As the opinion is accompanied by expression of a more complete awareness of the Veteran's medical history and clinical data, discusses all DSM-IV criteria necessary for a diagnosis of PTSD, includes a detailed explanation of the rationale for the opinion (identifying the specific symptoms found lacking for a diagnosis of PTSD), and the examiner comments on the other opinions already of record, the Board finds this opinion more probative than the essentially bare conclusions of the April 2006 and May 2006 statements from the Veteran's private physicians.
The examiner concluded that the Veteran does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD because he is not persistently re-experiencing the event and he does not have persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the "trauma" or numbing of general responsiveness.
In summary, the preponderance of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran has PTSD.
However, undisputed evidence reflects he has been sober since 1980, i.e. for decades prior to his instant claim of service connection.
