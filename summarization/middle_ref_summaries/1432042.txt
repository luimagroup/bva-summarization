The medical and lay evidence of record fails to demonstrate the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD.
The Veteran's depressive and anxiety symptoms are more likely than not related to his polysubstance abuse and/or dependence.
In rendering this diagnosis, the examiner stated that it was made primarily by review of medical records, including medical consequences of substances as the Veteran reported minimal to no significant negative consequences of drug/alcohol use and only acknowledged alcohol and crack cocaine use.
Consequently, the only evidence of record that indicates the Veteran has PTSD is his own statements to that effect.
