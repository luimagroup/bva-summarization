Although it is unquestioned that the Veteran served in Vietnam during the Vietnam War era, the primary impediment to a grant of service connection in this case is the absence of medical evidence of a current psychiatric disorder.
While sensitivity to loud noise is the type of symptom capable of lay observation, the record is devoid of evidence to suggest that the Veteran has ever been seen or treated for PTSD or any related psychiatric condition, either during service or after service separation.
Moreover as a clear preponderance of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD, consideration of any association between his current symptomatology and his claimed in-service stressors is not necessary.
Consequently, the probative value of the Veteran's implied or explicit assertions that he has PTSD are greatly outweighed by the objective findings of record.
