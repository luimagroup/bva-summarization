The veteran�s treatment records reveal treatment for various disabilities, including PTSD and alcohol abuse.
In February 1997 the former Environmental Support Group (ESG) [now U. S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records (USASCRUR)] confirmed that members of the U. S. Naval Mobile Construction Battalion ELEVEN (MCB-11) were exposed to motor and rocket attacks in areas including Camp Haines and Camp Evans during the veteran�s tour of duty.
The records also confirmed that members of the Landing Zone (LZ) Nancy assisted in extinguishing ammunitions fires. Additionally, the history verified that passenger vehicles struck land mines in August and September 1969.
The Board finds that further inquiry is needed, as the VA regulations pertaining to psychiatric disorders have changed during the pendency of this appeal.
The Board is cognizant of the veteran�s lengthy appeals process and does not desire to perpetuate this any longer than necessary however, the Board believes that further development of the evidence is necessary, to include a determination of any stressors and an examination to clarify the current psychiatric diagnosis and to determine whether the veteran meets the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD under the DSM-IV criteria.
Such remand will afford the veteran an additional opportunity to provide information concerning his claimed stressors.
