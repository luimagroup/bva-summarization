There is no indication of record that the RO adjudicated the Veteran's claimed personal (sexual assault) stressor.
Thereafter, the record reflects that the Veteran has been treated, at times, in the VA clinical setting for PTSD. The basis for the diagnosis is not fully explained.
Moreover, the record contains conflicting opinions by various examiners as to whether the DSM-IV criteria for a PTSD diagnosis have been met, and the Board cannot discern from either the favorable or unfavorable opinions the exact basis as to how all DSM-IV criteria have been met.
the favorable opinions in this case are not based upon sufficient facts, some of which remained to be adjudicated,
As such, the Board finds ample and necessary basis to remand this case for additional medical opinion.
