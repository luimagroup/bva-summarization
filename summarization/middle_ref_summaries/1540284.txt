After a thorough examination, the examiner found it less likely than not that the Veteran's schizoaffective disorder and panic disorder are related to his in-service emotional instability.
He further opined that the medical record strongly suggests that the Veteran was in a prodromal (beginning) state of schizophrenia during service, and that at least one in-service event could reasonably be expected to have exacerbated it.
VA examiners in March 2004 and August 2005 have offered opinions that weigh against the Veteran's claim, and Drs. E.P.A. and R.I.F. have rendered August 2008 and July 2015 opinions that weighs in favor of the claim.
The Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise in this case.
