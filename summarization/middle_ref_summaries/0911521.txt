He was diagnosed with major depression with suicidal ideation and PTSD.
In November 2002, a psychiatry note included a diagnosis of PTSD.
Also of record is a report of a VA psychiatric examination conducted in January 2003, which resulted in diagnoses including PTSD by history.
Here, the record includes an April 2007 VA examination, but the Board deems this examination inadequate.
The Board observes that the examiner therefore did not examine the July 1999 records currently in the claims file from Lafayette General Hospital and did not otherwise comment on the 1997 to 2002 VA treatment records showing PTSD, depression and other mental health treatment, or the March 2006 VA treatment record showing a diagnosis of PTSD.
As a result, the Board is of the opinion that the Veteran should be afforded another VA examination to determine the etiology of any such claimed psychological disorder found to be present, to include PTSD and its relationship to the Veteran's verified stressors.
Then, the RO should schedule the Veteran for an examination by a VA medical professional experienced in evaluating post-traumatic stress disorders, to determine the etiology of any psychiatric disorder(s) found to be present.
The examiner is advised that the Veteran served in Vietnam and maintains that he was exposed to hostile mortar and rocket fire and seeing a man who had his throat slashed and/or head cut off because he fell asleep while on guard duty.
