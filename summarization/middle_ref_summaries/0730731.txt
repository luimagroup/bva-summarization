Significantly, the record shows the veteran has not been provided with specific notice of certain provisions that apply to cases involving PTSD based on allegations of personal assault.
Further, the veteran's case would be stronger if he provided additional details concerning the claimed assault which would independently verify the claimed in-service stressor.
The RO should contact the veteran and notify him of the opportunity to furnish, or to advise VA of the potential source or sources of evidence other than his service records, or evidence of behavioral changes, that might constitute credible supporting evidence of his purported inservice stressor.
The veteran is to be invited to submit a statement providing greater detail concerning the claimed inservice stressor.
If and only if, an in-service stressor is independently verified, the RO should schedule the veteran for a psychiatric examination to determine the nature and etiology of any current PTSD.
