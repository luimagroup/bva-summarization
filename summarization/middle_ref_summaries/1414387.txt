In the October 2013 Joint Motion (JMR), it was noted that during the Veteran's December 1, 2011 hearing he commented that he was in receipt of ongoing treatment for PTSD at the Houma VA Outpatient Clinic.
In April 2013, the record contained records from the Houma VA Outpatient Clinic, but they only covered a period up to 2008.
The indispensable query is not treatment for PTSD, or a diagnosis of PTSD, but the Veteran's stressors in service.
In any event, per the October 2013 Joint Motion, this case must be remanded to allow the Agency of Original Jurisdiction additional opportunity to obtain the Veteran's treatment records from the Houma VA Outpatient Clinic for the period 2008 to the present.
Then, schedule the Veteran for a comprehensive VA psychiatric examination to obtain a current diagnosis including the severity of the Veteran's PTSD (if any), and to determine the nature and etiology of such diagnosis.
