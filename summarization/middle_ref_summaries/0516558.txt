To date, the veteran has not been afforded a VA examination to determine if he has PTSD and, if so, the stressors supporting the diagnosis.
In the Board's opinion, such an examination is required to comply with VA's duty to assist the veteran in the development of the facts pertinent to his claim.
Therefore, an attempt should be made to contact the VA medical facilities in Ohio, Kentucky, and Oklahoma to determine whether any treatment records exist from 1969 to 1990.
