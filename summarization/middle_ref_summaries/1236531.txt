The Veteran's treating psychiatrist submitted a May 2007 letter.
He indicated that she had PTSD due military sexual trauma.
However, the June 2006 VA psychiatric examination and May 2007 treating psychiatrist's letter are competent medical evidence that the Veteran currently has PTSD due to the in-service sexual assaults.
In summary, the record contains credible evidence of in-service sexual assaults and competent medical evidence showing that the Veteran's current symptoms meet the PTSD diagnostic criteria and are related to the reported in-service sexual assault stressors.
