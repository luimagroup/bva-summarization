In this regard, the veteran alleges that his performance declined following the sexual assault and there is an opinion relating the alleged in-service sexual trauma to several of the veteran's psychiatric disabilities.
However, the veteran's mental health care provider did not provide much detail to support his conclusions.
As such, the Board finds that an examination is necessary before a decision can be reached on this claim.
