The first examination, from October 2007, gives a detailed account of the Veteran's medical, social, and employment histories as well as a mental status evaluation.
Noting the varying diagnosis that the Veteran has been given throughout his course of treatment, including findings of a significant personality disorder and possible malingering, the examiner deferred diagnosis in the absence of psychological testing.
The examination report does not provide a clear opinion on the role that the Veteran's personality disorder or substance abuse may have played in the exaggeration or manifestation of PTSD symptoms.
Given the findings reached during the first VA examination, as well as the reservations expressed in the report of the January 2008 VA examination as to the validity of the diagnosis, the Board finds that a new VA examination is required in order to clearly determine (1) whether the Veteran has PTSD, and (2) if yes, whether the Veteran's PTSD may be attributable to verified, in-service stressors.
