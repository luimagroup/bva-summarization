A December 1997 note from a VA medical professional stated that the veteran was an insulin dependent diabetic and had been under significant stress at her current job, which had a direct effect on her diabetes.
The veteran has been granted service connection in effect for diabetes mellitus.
In an April 2002 letter, Dr. J. A. Flores, opined that the veteran's psychiatric disorder is due to her diabetes mellitus. The veteran currently is rated as 100 percent disabled for her service-connected diabetes mellitus.
Hence, the evidence has demonstrated that the veteran's chronic acquired psychiatric disorder, is proximately due to or the result of her service-connected diabetes.
Therefore, service connection is warranted for a chronic acquired psychiatric disorder.
