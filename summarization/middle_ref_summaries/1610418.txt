Specifically, the Board directed the examiner to provide a diagnosis of any acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD and anxiety disorder NOS, and if he or she disagreed with a diagnosis in file, the examiner should explain why the diagnosis was not warranted.
The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2015 at which time he was diagnosed with an unspecified anxiety disorder.
However, he is already service-connected for that disability, and the examiner did not address any of the other diagnoses of record.
Therefore, an additional VA examination and medical opinion are needed to ensure compliance with the prior remand.
