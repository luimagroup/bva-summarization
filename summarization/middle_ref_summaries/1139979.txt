A March 1984 service personnel record shows that the United States Navy was unable to locate the appellant's health and dental records due to his lengthy periods of unauthorized absence.
In light of the above, a VA examination with a medical opinion is necessary for the adjudication of this claim.
The Veteran is receiving Social Security disability benefits.
The Social Security Administration records are potentially relevant to his claim and must be obtained.
Finally, the Veteran has identified various providers of psychiatric treatment and should be afforded one last opportunity to submit individual authorizations of release for those providers.
