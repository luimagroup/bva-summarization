The Board's August 2012 decision was vacated due to outstanding VA treatment records from the Long Beach VA Medical Center (VAMC) and Las Vegas VAMC.
The most recent records from Law Vegas are dated from November 2007, and the Board cannot point to treatment records from Long Beach.
The parties further suggested that a current VA examination may be needed, based on the complete claims file, to include a review of the above-referenced records.
After any additional records are associated with the claims file, the Veteran should be afforded a VA psychiatric examination to address the nature and likely etiology of any psychiatric disorder other than PTSD.
When the development requested has been completed, the case should be reviewed by the RO/AMC on the basis of additional evidence.
