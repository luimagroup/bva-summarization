The Board observes that the RO attempted to verify the veteran's stressors with the U.S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records (USACRUR); however, USACRUR indicated that more specific stressors were needed.
As she has attempted identified events with more specificity, the RO should again request verification from USACRUR to include reports of unit activities.
