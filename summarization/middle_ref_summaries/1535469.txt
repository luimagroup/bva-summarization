the fact that the Veteran had a positive PTSD screen does not constitute evidence of a competent diagnosis of PTSD.
There is no indication of psychiatric treatment or intervention during the Veteran's active service or for the years immediately following service.
the competent evidence of record does not show that psychosis was diagnosed within one year of separation.
The preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety, and the claim is denied.
