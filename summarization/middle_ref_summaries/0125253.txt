The current rebuilt claims folder does not contain the veteran's service medical records.
A VA psychiatric examination was provided in December 1998 and January 1999, and the diagnosis was depression; it was found the veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.
This VA examination, however, was performed before the veteran submitted many records of past psychiatric treatment.
In view of the fact that the original claims folder has been lost, and given the duty to assist requirements of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000), and a recently enacted companion VA regulation, further development of the evidence is warranted.
Further efforts should be made to obtain pertinent records from during and after service, and another VA examination should be provided.
The RO should then review the claim for service connection for a psychiatric disorder, including PTSD.
