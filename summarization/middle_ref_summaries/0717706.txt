In April 2004, VA sent a letter to the veteran pertaining to his claim for service connection for anxiety/depression.
The Board notes, however, that VA has not provided guidance to the veteran as to how to substantiate a claim for PTSD which entails different legal criteria.
The Board finds VA should contact the veteran to determine if there are any outstanding treatment records and, if so, should take appropriate steps to obtain the evidence identified by the veteran if possible.
