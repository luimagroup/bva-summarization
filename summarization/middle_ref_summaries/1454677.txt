The evidence also reflects that the Veteran has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder in the past.
Specifically, VA treatment records from February and April 2009 contain an Axis I diagnosis of bipolar disorder by history.
Additionally, a January 2009 report assessment and plan section indicates that the Veteran was to be treated for bipolar disorder and referred him to mental health services.
The Board finds that the proximity of the Veteran's treatment for bipolar disorder, coupled with the July 2013 examiner's notation that the Veteran continued to experience symptoms as recently as 2011, is evidence of a current psychological disorder.
In light of the Veteran's confirmed in-service stressor and current disorder, a medical opinion regarding the nexus of the Veteran's bipolar disorder is required.
While the 2013 examiner did opine that there was no discernible nexus between the Veteran's mood disturbances and his in-service stressor, this opinion is not supported by any rationale and is thus inadequate for VA purposes.
The opinion is also inadequate because it does not address whether the Veteran's bipolar disorder is related to any other aspect of his military service besides the specific stressors asserted in his PTSD claim.
As such, remand is necessary to obtain an opinion as to the etiology of the Veteran's bipolar disorder.
