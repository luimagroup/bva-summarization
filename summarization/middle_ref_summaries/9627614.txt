The evidence of record does not show a clear diagnosis of PTSD, nor does it show a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed inservice stressor.
The veteranï¿½s service medical records are silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of PTSD.
During a VA PTSD examination performed in October 1993, it was reported that while in Vietnam, the veteran drove an ammunition truck and was in three rocket attacks and some mortar attacks.
He stated that he saw people killed and wounded.
The Board notes that the veteran has been diagnosed as having PTSD on several occasions, however, the evidence of record fails to provide a clear diagnosis of the condition.
Specifically, the most recent VA examination of the veteran dated in December 1995, noted that there were no psychosis, delusions, or hallucinations, and failed to render a diagnosis of PTSD.
As claimed stressors, the veteran reports that while in Vietnam he was under three rocket attacks and one mortar attack.
However, none of the diagnoses of PTSD cited by the veteran specifically relates PTSD to the identified stressors.
