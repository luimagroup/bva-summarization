In the March 2014 Memorandum Decision, the Court found that the Board (1) failed to provide adequate reasons or bases for its decision by not discussing whether VA substantially complied with the Board's January 2010 remand order; (2) clearly erred in any implicit determination that the remand order was complied with; and, (3) clearly erred in finding that VA satisfied its duty to assist the appellant.
In light of the Memorandum Decision, the Board finds that remand is warranted so that the RO may attempt to obtain additional service personnel records that reflect the Veteran's purported service in Vietnam and Laos.
Contact the NPRC and specifically request that it determine if there are any classified service medical and personnel records for the Veteran, primarily as it relates to events surrounding his purported duty in a "black ops" unit in Laos and North Vietnam in 1962 and his purported capture (and 6 day detainment) by a small group of North Vietnamese in February 1962 and March 1962.
After completing all indicated development, the RO should readjudicate the Veteran's claim on appeal in light of all the evidence of record.
