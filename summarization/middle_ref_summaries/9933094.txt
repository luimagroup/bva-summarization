The evidence shows that the veteran continued to experience arrhythmia and associated symptomatology (such as palpitations and chest pain) well after Nardil had been discontinued as treatment for his service-connected PTSD.
In the opinion of the VA examiner, the etiology of the veteran's arrhythmia is unclear, and there is no medical or evidence which suggests an etiological relationship between Nardil and the intermittent atrial arrhythmia from which the veteran currently suffers.
The preponderance of the available evidence weighs against a finding that the veteran's currently manifested arrhythmia is proximately due to or the result of medication prescribed as treatment for PTSD.
