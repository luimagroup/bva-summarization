There is no convincing, credible evidence of record that an in-service stressor incident took place.
As far as the Veteran's diagnosis for major depressive disorder, the Veteran does not contend and the record does not show that major depressive disorder had its onset or is otherwise related to active duty.
In fact, the Veteran related his depressive symptoms to the death of several family members including his mother and cousin.
Post-service treatment records show that he was first diagnosed with depression in 2002, or more than 31 years post-service.
The record here does not contain evidence that demonstrates that the Veteran has PTSD.
Accordingly, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
