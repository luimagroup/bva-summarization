In the present case, the evidence indicates the veteran had PTSD that clearly preexisted service.
For example, a June 2003 report from a private psychologist, R.R.B., Ph.D., provides that the veteran had long-standing mood and anxiety problems.
The Board also finds that the medical evidence of record, overall, demonstrates that the veteran's preexisting PTSD did not undergo an increase in severity during service and was thus not aggravated by service.
Overall, the Board finds that the evidence shows that the veteran did not incur or aggravate PTSD during active duty. As the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.
