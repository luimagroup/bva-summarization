Initially, the Board finds that there is no evidence that the veteran participated in combat during active service.
The veteran's DD Form 214 reflects that he served during the Vietnam Era; however, he had no foreign and/or sea service.
In a statement received in August 2003, the veteran claimed that while stationed in Kingsville, Texas in 1973, he was assigned to crash unit security and that he had to clean up crash sites.
Based on the current evidence of claimed stressors submitted by the veteran, there is insufficient details to allow for corroboration.
Specifically, although the veteran claims that he cleaned up crash sites in 1973, he did not provide any detailed information pertaining to the date of a specific crash to allow for verification.
Thus, the veteran has not furnished any details of alleged stressors to allow for an attempt to verify such claimed stressors.
Service connection for PTSD must be denied as there is no evidence that any current PTSD that he may suffer from is related to any stressors that occurred during his active duty service.
In conclusion, there is no evidence that the veteran engaged in combat and the only evidence of in-service stressors are contained in the veteran's uncorroborated statements, and private medical records based on the veteran's uncorroborated statements.
