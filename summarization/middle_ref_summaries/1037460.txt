In March 2006, the Veteran submitted an account of being in very close proximity at the time a fellow service member was killed and of having to view autopsy photos related to this incident.
The Veteran further indicated that this event occurred while he was stationed in Mannheim, Germany.
Nonetheless, the examiner failed to address whether any acquired psychiatric disorder, to include MDD and/or PTSD, (i) had its onset in- service, (ii) was related to the Veteran's military service, and/or (iii) whether any such disorder was caused and/or aggravated by any service-connected disorder.
Accordingly, the Board has no choice but to remand the claim once again to obtain a sufficient medical examination.
The AMC/RO should again contact the Veteran and request additional information that would assist in the verification of the incident in which the Veteran witnessed the death of a fellow soldier as noted in his March 2006 substantive appeal, including, but not necessarily limited to, the date, time, and location of the incident, the circumstances surrounding the incident, and the identity of any other witnesses to the incident.
After the aforementioned development has been completed and all records, and/or the negative response, associated with the claims folder, the Veteran should be afforded another VA examination to determine the current nature and etiology of any acquired psychiatric disorder, to include a major depressive disorder and PTSD.
