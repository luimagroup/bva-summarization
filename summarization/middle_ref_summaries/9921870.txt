Accordingly, there was no mention of the veteran's active duty service in connection with the diagnosis of PTSD at the time it was made.
the Board has also considered the statement of the veteran's friend that she has known the veteran for two years and was told by the veteran that she had been raped in service.
The testimony, in 1996, does not provide a basis for relating PTSD to service, some 35 years earlier, nor is she competent to make that medical connection.
the veteran has failed to show a medical nexus between service and PTSD, as required by law, and the claim must be denied.
