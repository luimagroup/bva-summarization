There is also no evidence of a nexus between the veteran's current psychiatric disability and service.
In sum, while the veteran currently has a psychiatric disability, other than PTSD, it has not been linked to an in- service event.
In this regard, in response to a request by VA, the U. S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) was unable to verify the veteran's claimed stressor.
The preponderance of the evidence is against a finding that the veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. ï¿½ 4.125, and as such, there is no medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.
