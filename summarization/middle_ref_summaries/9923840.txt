The Board notes that if the veteran did not engage in combat, his statements are inadequate to prove the occurrence of a stressor in service; such a stressor must be established by official service records or other credible supporting evidence.
There is no indication that the RO made any efforts to corroborate the veteran's statements of stressors with the U.S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records (USASCRUR).
In an effort to assist the veteran in completing his claim for service connection for PTSD, the Board finds that additional development (including an attempt to verify claimed in-service stressors, and the other action outlined below) is warranted.
