The Veteran's service treatment records do not show any relevant treatment, complaints, or diagnoses; a separation examination report is not of record.
As for the post-service medical evidence, it includes VA progress notes, which show that as of 2011, the Veteran was diagnosed with disorders that include an anxiety disorder, and a major depressive disorder/depression NOS (not otherwise specified).
The May 2013 and September 2014 VA examiners both specifically concluded that a PTSD diagnosis could not be provided, because the Veteran's self-reports were non-credible.
The Board has considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, as is stated above, the preponderance of the evidence is against the appellant's claim, and the doctrine is not for application.
Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran has not been prejudiced by a failure of VA in its duty to assist, and that any violation of the duty to assist could be no more than harmless error.
