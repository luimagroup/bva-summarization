The Veteran underwent a VA compensation and pension examination in September 2005, in which she related her history and claimed in-service stressor to the examiner.
The examiner diagnosed PTSD which existed prior to service and that was aggravated by MST during her active duty.
The Board notes that the examiner gave no rationale for the opinion.
After a review of the file, the Board finds that another VA examination is warranted to ascertain the nature of any psychiatric disorder that may have existed prior to service, and if shown, whether the Veteran's preexisting psychiatric disability was aggravated by service.
