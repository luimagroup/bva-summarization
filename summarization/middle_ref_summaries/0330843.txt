The veteran has reported particular service stressors, but the RO has not attempted to verify them through the U.S. Armed Services Center for Unit Records Research (CURR). Outpatient records which have been obtained include references to possible PTSD, although the veteran has not been given a VA compensation examination.
In written argument to the Board, the veteran's representative argues that the VA should attempt to verify stressors and provide a VA examination.
The Board agrees that such is warranted as part of the VA's duty to assist the veteran in developing evidence pertinent to his claim.
