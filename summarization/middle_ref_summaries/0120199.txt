The veteran has requested that VA obtain morning reports for HQ Co., 4th Marines, 3rd Marine Division, for the months of April and August 1969.
These, he believes, will help in verifying his reported stressor incidents, particularly with regard to verifying the accident involving Richard Blane.
The RO has not attempted to procure morning reports from the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC).
Therefore, the Board agrees that morning reports should be obtained in an effort to verify the veteran's stressors.
