This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a June 2005 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Indianapolis, Indiana, which denied service connection for PTSD.
Entitlement to service connection for an anxiety disorder, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1947 to January 1947 and from September 1950 to October 1951.
The Veteran's January 1947 separation examination revealed that no psychiatric disabilities were present; and the service treatment records for the Veteran's second period of service, which ended in October 1951, do not describe any psychiatric complaints or disabilities.
he first evidence of an anxiety disorder comes more than 50 years after the Veteran left military service,
There are no in- service or post service medical records indicating that the Veteran developed an anxiety disorder during service. Accordingly, Hickson element (2) has not been met, and the Veteran's claim fails on this basis alone.
In the absence of element (2), it follows that element (3), medical nexus, is necessarily lacking.
Indeed, the evidence of record does not include any medical statements attempting to link the Veteran's currently diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder or depression to his military service over a half century earlier.
Entitlement to service connection for an anxiety disorder is denied.
