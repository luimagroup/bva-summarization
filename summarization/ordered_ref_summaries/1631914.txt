Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from February 1968 to April 1970.
The claims file currently includes VA treatment records from the Prescott VA Medical Center (VAMC), dated from June 2000 through March 2014; and from the Las Vegas VAMC dated from March 2011 through April 2016.
hus, outstanding mental health records-to include Prescott VAMC records dated since March 2014 , and Las Vegas VAMC records dated since April 2016-likely exist.
Hence, the AOJ should obtain all outstanding, pertinent records of mental evaluation and/or treatment of the Veteran, following the procedures prescribed in 38 C.F.R. ï¿½ 3.159(c) as regards requests for records from Federal facilities.
For reasons expressed below, the matter on appeal is being remanded to the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).
