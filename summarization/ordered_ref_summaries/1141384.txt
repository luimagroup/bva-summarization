The matter came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) initially on appeal from a May 2002 rating decision issued in June 2002 in which the RO, in part, denied the Veteran's service-connection claim for PTSD.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from June 1973 to March 1987.
In January 2010, the Veteran's personnel file confirmed that he was assigned to the USS Barney between November 1980 and April 1981 and that it has been verified that the Veteran was deployed in support of the Iranian Hostage Crisis aboard the USS Barney during that time period.
Similarly, in June 2010, the JSRRC confirmed that, in March 1982, while the USS Nicholson was participating in the ASW exercise SHARE 47 in the Ionian Sea, a LAMPS helicopter from the USS McCandless experienced engine failure and radioed to the USS Nicholson for an emergency landing.
Thus, two of the Veteran's stressors have been verified.
The examiner added, given that the Veteran is at least as likely as not to have observed the incident as described in the JSRRC's stressor verification review, the stressor-the March 1982 helicopter emergency landing incident-would be adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and the Veteran's PTSD symptoms are related to this stressor.
Here, the VA examiner has diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD based on an incident involving actual or threatened serious injury or death to the Veteran and others.
And the verified incident is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's active naval service.
Under the circumstances, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for PTSD.
The appeal is granted.
