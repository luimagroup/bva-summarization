This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2006 rating decision, of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Cleveland, Ohio.
Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as due to herbicide exposure and secondary to service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and/or diabetes mellitus type II.
The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1966 to April 1969, with service in Vietnam.
The evidence of record shows the Veteran has a diagnosis of hypertension.
Based on this evidence, the Board finds the Veteran served in the Republic of Vietnam, during an applicable presumptive period, and is therefore presumed to have been exposed to herbicides.
urning to the third element of service connection, the evidence of record shows a causal connection between the Veteran's hypertension and his active service, to include herbicide exposure.
In conclusion, the Board has competent and credible testimony from the Veteran regarding his exposure to herbicides in-service and a positive probative opinion from a specialist providing a causal connection between the Veteran's hypertension and his active service.
Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, as due to herbicide exposure is granted.
