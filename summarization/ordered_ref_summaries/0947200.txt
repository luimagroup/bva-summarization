This matter came to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2004 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from September 1967 to May 1969.
In March 2008 the Board remanded the case ordering the verification of the Veteran's alleged PTSD stressor, and the conduction of a medical examination, if such stressor was verified by the Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC).
Specifically, he contends that he developed PTSD as a result of a noncombat incident which occurred during the Fall of 1968, approximately between September and November 1968, when he was stationed with the 226th Signal Company in Korea and worked as a radio teletype operator.
The AMC should submit another request to the JSRRC requesting it verify whether the Veteran's unit, the 226th Signal Company stationed in the Republic of Korea, at some time between September 1, 1968 through November 30, 1968, was placed on heightened alert as a result of a possible sighting of a large number of enemy ships offshore.
If and only if the attempt to obtain evidence corroborating the Veteran's claimed stressor proves successful, the Veteran should be afforded a VA psychiatric examination for the purposes of determining whether a current diagnosis of PTSD is appropriate, and, if so, whether that diagnosis may be etiologically related to the corroborated stressor.
Unfortunately, another remand is required to attempt to verify the Veteran's stressor.
