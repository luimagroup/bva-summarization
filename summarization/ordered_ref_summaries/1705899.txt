This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2007 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in Indianapolis, Indiana (hereinafter, Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ)).
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active military service, including active duty and active duty for training from June 1975 to July 1978, October 1978 to November 1982, and from December 1986 to October 1992.
The Board specifically found that the Veteran had submitted sufficient information to attempt to verify the stressors which allegedly occurred in 1978 and 1982, as he provided an approximate date of the event, the location of the event, the name of the individual involved and the unit of assignment.
However, the Board required further information regarding the other claimed stressors. As such, the Board directed the AOJ to obtain additional information from the Veteran and attempt to verify the stressors which allegedly occurred in 1978 and 1982 with the U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) as well as any additional stressors which may be verifiable.
The AOJ's reliance on the VA Adjudication Procedures Manual is an insufficient basis to comply with the prior remand directives.
The examiner did not address the other diagnoses of record which now include anxiety and panic disorder without agoraphobia, panic disorder with agoraphobia, depression not otherwise specified (NOS), major depressive disorder and PTSD.
Following an attempt at JSRRC corroboration, the claims folder must be returned to the examiner to clarify whether these additional diagnoses may be attributable to service, or whether such diagnoses were incorrect.
The appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ.
