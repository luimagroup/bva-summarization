This matter comes to the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2012 decision by which the RO denied entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from 1962 to 1965.
A remand is required in this case to ensure there is a complete record upon which to decide this claim.
VA has a duty to make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate a claim for the benefit sought, unless no reasonable possibility exists that such assistance would aid in substantiating the claim. 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(a) (West 2002 & Supp. 2013); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c), (d) (2013).
Because there is evidence of a current psychiatric disorder and some evidence of its presence immediately following service separation,
a VA mental disorders examination is necessary for a diagnosis of all extant acquired psychiatric disorders as well as an opinion regarding the likely etiology of each such disability diagnosed.
this claim is REMANDED to the RO/AMC
