This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) on appeal from a March 2010 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Louis, Missouri, which denied the benefit sought on appeal.
Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from November 1968 to June 1971, and from September 1984 to February 2005.
The evidence does not show that the Veteran engaged in combat or experienced a stressor during active duty.
There is no evidence in this case to confirm any of the Veteran's alleged stressors.
The diagnoses of PTSD in the Veteran's VA treatment records and the March 2012 VA examination report do not corroborate that any stressor occurred.
A March 2010 VA memorandum in the claims file notes that the Veteran's service personnel records do not record that he was ever attached to HQ Advisory Group 75th (MACV).
The Vietnam Casualty List did not contain the name of Specialist Alfredo Gonzalez as being killed in Vietnam.
A March 2010 statement from the Joint Service Records Research Center reflected that examined records did not document that a person named Jones was killed, or was killed in an accident, in Thailand during the relevant period.
In the absence of a showing of combat with the enemy or evidence of a verifiable stressor, the Board concludes that the Veteran has failed to satisfy the criteria for service connection for PTSD.
As the Veteran bases his claim on the reported stressors, service connection cannot be granted without verification of them, regardless of the current diagnosis of PTSD or positive nexus opinion.
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
