This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) on appeal from an August 2003 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Louisville, Kentucky, which denied the benefit sought on appeal.
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, mood disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as due to military sexual trauma.
The veteran served on active duty from March 1976 to November 1977.
In this regard, the veteran alleges that his performance declined following the sexual assault and there is an opinion relating the alleged in-service sexual trauma to several of the veteran's psychiatric disabilities.
However, the veteran's mental health care provider did not provide much detail to support his conclusions.
As such, the Board finds that an examination is necessary before a decision can be reached on this claim.
