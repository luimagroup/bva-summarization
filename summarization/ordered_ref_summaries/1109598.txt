This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following Board Remands in May 2006 and November 2009. This matter was originally on appeal from a March 2003 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO) in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive disorder.
The Veteran had active military service from August 1967 to August 1969.
The July 2009 VA psychiatrists were provided an opportunity to elaborate on why they felt that Veteran showed no symptoms of re-experiencing the traumatic event.
As the July 2009 VA psychiatrists did not provide a complete rationale with respect to their opinion that the Veteran did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD, the Board cannot accept their opinion as competent.
The record reflects verified in-service stressor events related to the Veteran's combat experiences.
As noted above, in-service stressors which have been verified include being fired upon and sharing one foxhole barely large enough for 2 people with 15 people and witnessing soldiers operating a front loader and throwing dead bodies into a ditch.
Although medical professional disagree as to whether a diagnosis of PTSD is appropriate, the Veteran's treating psychiatric professionals endorse a finding of PTSD associated with the verified combat stressors.
Therefore, resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, a diagnosis of PTSD is established.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.
