This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2003 rating determination by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Muskogee, Oklahoma.
Entitlement to service connection for a chronic acquired psychiatric disability, including schizophrenia and/or post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The appellant is not a veteran, and he has never served on active duty.
Finally, an official VA psychiatric examination of the appellant in October 2002 (conducted without a review of most of the relevant medical records) resulted in a diagnosis of schizophrenia, undifferentiated type.
There appears to be a substantial question remaining in this appeal as to what is the appellant's correct current psychiatric diagnosis. Further clarification of this matter is needed.
Although the appellant and his representative have requested that VA assist them in verifying these claimed stressor events in service, they have pointed to no concrete action which VA could take in this regard.
Further appellate review of this claim would not be appropriate until this violation of the appellant's due process rights can be corrected.
this appeal is remanded
