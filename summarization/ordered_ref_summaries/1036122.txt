This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2007 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Waco, Texas.
Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), claimed as due to in-service personal assault.
The Veteran served on active duty from March 1977 to January 1978.
The Veteran was sent a duty-to-assist letter in December 2006, which included a stressor identification worksheet, but the letter did not detail the majority of the information cited above.
There is no actual documentation in the claims folder of the claimed incident, but the Board noted the RO should make a search of deck logs from September 1977 to ascertain whether the incident was documented.
VA outpatient treatment records reflect a diagnosis of PTSD related to this personal assault incident, but the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2007 where the examiner opined the Veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.
In light of the possible missing records and the VCAA notice deficiencies, the Board finds further development is warranted.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.
