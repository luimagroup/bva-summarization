On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Seattle, Washington
Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The appellant served on active duty in the United States Air Force from February 1949 to October 1970.
As there is no indication that any failure on the part of VA to provide additional notice or assistance reasonably affects the outcome of this case, the Board finds that any such failure is harmless.
As a result, the Board is left with only the appellant's service personnel records, which record only that he was a maintenance superintendent with no combat experience.
Since the Board finds that the appellant did not engage in combat with the enemy, there must be credible supporting evidence of record that an alleged stressor occurred in order to warrant service connection.
As the claim fails for lack of a credible, verified stressor, further inquiry into a nexus between the PTSD and the alleged stressors is moot.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
