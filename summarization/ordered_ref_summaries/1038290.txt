This matter initially came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a November 2002 rating decision of the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from November 1972 to August 1976.
Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal.
As a matter of law, appellants' claims do not survive their deaths.
This appeal on the merits has become moot by virtue of the death of the Veteran and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
The appeal is dismissed.
