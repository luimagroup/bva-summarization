This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2004 rating decision of the Atlanta, Georgia, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which denied entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from September 1967 to June 1970.
The veteran has not been diagnosed with PTSD based on an independently verified in-service stressor.
While the veteran claims to have been in Tan Son Nhut, there is no documentation to substantiate the allegation that the airbase was attacked while he was there, to include lay statements from someone who served with him.
Thus, the Board does not find that the veteran engaged in combat.
While the veteran at his November 2008 hearing stated that he was in Cam Ranh Bay in March 1968 when it received incoming mortar rounds, a review of the evidence of record shows that the appellant has never been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder based on this March 1968 stressor standing alone.
Indeed, the Board can find no reference to this March 1968 stressor in any clinical record.
While the veteran has been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder, such diagnosis is not based upon an independently-verified stressor.
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
