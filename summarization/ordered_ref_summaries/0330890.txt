Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Such records should encompass the veteran's entire period of active duty, from August 1965 until August 1967.
In August 2002, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) ordered further development in your case.
Thereafter, your case was sent to the Board's Evidence Development Unit (EDU), to undertake the requested development.
Recently, in light of the Federal Circuit Court's decision and other policy considerations, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) determined that VBA would resume all development functions.
In other words, aside from the limited class of development functions that the Board is statutorily permitted to carry out, see 38 U.S.C.A. �� 7107(b), 7109(a), all evidence development will be conducted at the regional office (RO) level.
After the development requested above has been completed to the extent possible, the RO should again review the record.
Accordingly, this matter is REMANDED to the RO
