This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2012 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Huntington, West Virginia.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (NOS).
The Veteran had active service in the United States Army from May 1969 to November 1971.
Specifically, the Board directed the examiner to provide a diagnosis of any acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD and anxiety disorder NOS, and if he or she disagreed with a diagnosis in file, the examiner should explain why the diagnosis was not warranted.
The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2015 at which time he was diagnosed with an unspecified anxiety disorder.
However, he is already service-connected for that disability, and the examiner did not address any of the other diagnoses of record.
Therefore, an additional VA examination and medical opinion are needed to ensure compliance with the prior remand.
The appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ.
