This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Columbia, South Carolina.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active service from September 1995 to February 1996 and from December 2003 to March 2005.
Here, the VA examiner concluded that the Veteran met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD and linked the PTSD diagnosis to the Veteran's anxiety over his belief that he was in constant danger while he was in Iraq.
The Board finds that the reported stressor is consistent with the circumstances of the Veteran's service.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.
