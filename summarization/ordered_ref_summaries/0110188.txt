This case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 1998 RO decision which denied his claim for service connection for PTSD.
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from October 1943 to October 1948.
RO rating decisions in October 1998 and June 1999, and the August 1999 statement of the case, collectively indicate the RO denied service connection for PTSD on the rationale that the claim was not well grounded.
However, there has been a significant change in the law during the pendency of this appeal.
Because of the change in the law, a remand is required for compliance with the notice and duty to assist provisions contained in the new law.
Under the circumstances of this case, as part of the duty to assist, an effort should be made to verify service stressors, any additional post-service medical records should be obtained, and a VA compensation examination for PTSD should be provided.
Accordingly, this case is REMANDED
