This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an October 2000 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in New York, New York.
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from February 1957 to February 1960.
the Board finds that additional development is required before the Veteran's claim is decided.
The parties then noted that JSRRC had not stated whether records from the remaining portion of the Veteran's period of service, from January 1960 to February 1960, were available or had been reviewed, and no follow-up request to JSRRC was made.
