This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2011 decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Columbia, South Carolina.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety.
The Veteran served on active duty from August 1980 to August 1983.
the fact that the Veteran had a positive PTSD screen does not constitute evidence of a competent diagnosis of PTSD.
There is no indication of psychiatric treatment or intervention during the Veteran's active service or for the years immediately following service.
the competent evidence of record does not show that psychosis was diagnosed within one year of separation.
The preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety, and the claim is denied.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety, is denied.
