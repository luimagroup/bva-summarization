This matter comes before the Board of Veteransï¿½ Appeals (Board) on appeal of a September 1994 rating determination by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from August 1966 to May 1969 and from June 1974 to June 1975.
The veteran has reported a number of alleged stressful incidents.
However, on repeated occasions, he was given opportunities to provide either corroborating evidence or specific information with regard to the stressors.
At his December 1995 hearing, he failed to give any specifics, despite questioning by the hearing officer and his representative.
Having concluded that the required credible supporting evidence of a stressor is not present, the Board finds that service connection for PTSD is not appropriate.
In the absence of verified stressors in service, it would serve no useful appellate purpose to remand the case for a medical examination, pursuant to the August 1997 Board remand, to consider the relationship between unverified stressors and any post service symptomatology.
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
