This matter came to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2000 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Montgomery, Alabama.
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from September 1990 to May 1991 which included service in Southwest Asia from November 1990 to April 1991.
The Board observes that the RO attempted to verify the veteran's stressors with the U.S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records (USACRUR); however, USACRUR indicated that more specific stressors were needed.
As she has attempted identified events with more specificity, the RO should again request verification from USACRUR to include reports of unit activities.
Accordingly, this case is REMANDED
