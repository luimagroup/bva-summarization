This matter comes before the Board of Veterans� Appeals (Board) on appeal from adverse rating determinations by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) located in Roanoke, Virginia.
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from February 1968 to November 1969.
The veteran�s treatment records reveal treatment for various disabilities, including PTSD and alcohol abuse.
In February 1997 the former Environmental Support Group (ESG) [now U. S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records (USASCRUR)] confirmed that members of the U. S. Naval Mobile Construction Battalion ELEVEN (MCB-11) were exposed to motor and rocket attacks in areas including Camp Haines and Camp Evans during the veteran�s tour of duty.
The records also confirmed that members of the Landing Zone (LZ) Nancy assisted in extinguishing ammunitions fires. Additionally, the history verified that passenger vehicles struck land mines in August and September 1969.

Such remand will afford the veteran an additional opportunity to provide information concerning his claimed stressors.
The case is therefore REMANDED to the RO for the following actions:
