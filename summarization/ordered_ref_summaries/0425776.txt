This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2001 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Columbia, South Carolina, which denied service connection for PTSD.
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from August 1970 to February 1972, and from October 1976 to November 1978.
The veteran has produced medical evidence in the form of a letter from K. Northwall, M.D., which shows that he received a diagnosis of PTSD.
The April 2002 letter documented the veteran's alleged stressors which involve sights he witnessed as an undercover narcotics military police officer.
The AMC or RO should ask the veteran to provide the specific information needed to obtain credible supporting evidence from the U.S. Armed Services Center for Unit Records Research (CURR) in accordance with M21-1, Part III, Para. 5.14(c).
The AMC or RO should take the necessary steps to obtain records of the veteran's treatment from Dr Northwall and Dr. Meiler.
The AMC or RO should then re- adjudicate the veteran's claim, and if it remains denied, issue a supplemental statement of the case.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.
