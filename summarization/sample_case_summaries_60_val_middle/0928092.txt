The favorable opinions in this case diagnosing PTSD are based, in part, upon the Veteran's alleged stressor of having being raped during service and are rendered without any benefit of review of the claims folder.
On remand, however, the Board will request that direct searches be conducted in the facilities and dates identified.
Next, arrange for the Veteran to be afforded a VA psychiatric examination by a panel of three Board-certified psychiatrists.
At this time, only the Veteran's stressor of witnessing the death of a construction worker for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers when he got caught in a drilling rig has been established.
Determine whether the Veteran manifests PTSD according to the DSM-IV criteria, fully explaining how each criterion have been met or not met.
