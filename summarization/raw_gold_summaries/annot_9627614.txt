#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran served on active duty from November 1965 to November 1968.

#Procedural History#
This appeal arises from a rating decision from the Muskogee, Oklahoma, Regional Office (RO), in which entitlement to service connection for PTSD was denied.

#Reasoning#
The evidence of record does not show a clear diagnosis of PTSD, nor does it show a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed inservice stressor.

#Reasoning#
The veteranï¿½s service medical records are silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
During a VA PTSD examination performed in October 1993, it was reported that while in Vietnam, the veteran drove an ammunition truck and was in three rocket attacks and some mortar attacks.

#Evidential Support#
He stated that he saw people killed and wounded.

#Reasoning#
The Board notes that the veteran has been diagnosed as having PTSD on several occasions, however, the evidence of record fails to provide a clear diagnosis of the condition.

#Evidential Support#
Specifically, the most recent VA examination of the veteran dated in December 1995, noted that there were no psychosis, delusions, or hallucinations, and failed to render a diagnosis of PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
As claimed stressors, the veteran reports that while in Vietnam he was under three rocket attacks and one mortar attack.

#Reasoning#
However, none of the diagnoses of PTSD cited by the veteran specifically relates PTSD to the identified stressors.

#Outcome#
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
