#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran served on active duty from September 1942 to March 1946.

#Procedural History#
This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a rating decision of September 2001 from the Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which denied entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
One stressor he testified about in his April 2005 hearing was an incident shortly after he arrived in Guam around late 1958, early 1959, when a marine gate guard shot himself in the head in close proximity to the veteran.

#Evidential Support#
He testified that after serving in Guam, he was stationed onshore for 9 months in Hawaii serving at Camp Smith under CINPAC and while there he saw a friend's roomate bleeding and apparently dead on his cot with his wrists slashed.

#Evidential Support#
Thereafter, he was assigned to the U.S.S. Hull, where he was again a witness to a suicide by gunshot.

#Reasoning#
Although there are service personnel records associated with the claims file, which verify his service in Guam in late 1958, with CINCPACFLT from around May 1959 to March 1960 and with the U.S.S. Hull after March 1960 to around May 1961, no real attempt appears to have been made to verify the claimed stressors.

#Outcome#
Accordingly, in order to ensure further compliance with the VA's duty to assist, this case is REMANDED to the VBA AMC for the following actions:

#Reasoning#
The examiner must determine the nature, severity, and etiology of any psychiatric disorder(s) present, to include PTSD if present.

#Reasoning#
If PTSD is diagnosed, the examiner should consider only the verified stressors.
