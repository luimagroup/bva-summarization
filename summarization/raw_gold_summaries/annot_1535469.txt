#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety.

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty from August 1980 to August 1983.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2011 decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Columbia, South Carolina.

#Evidential Support#
the fact that the Veteran had a positive PTSD screen does not constitute evidence of a competent diagnosis of PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
There is no indication of psychiatric treatment or intervention during the Veteran's active service or for the years immediately following service.

#Evidential Support#
the competent evidence of record does not show that psychosis was diagnosed within one year of separation.

#Reasoning#
The preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety, and the claim is denied.

#Outcome#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety, is denied.
