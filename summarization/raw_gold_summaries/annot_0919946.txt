#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty from May 1967 to February 1971.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2003 rating decision by the Los Angeles, California, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which denied entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

#Reasoning#
There is no convincing, credible evidence of record that an in-service stressor incident took place.

#Evidential Support#
As far as the Veteran's diagnosis for major depressive disorder, the Veteran does not contend and the record does not show that major depressive disorder had its onset or is otherwise related to active duty.

#Evidential Support#
In fact, the Veteran related his depressive symptoms to the death of several family members including his mother and cousin.

#Evidential Support#
Post-service treatment records show that he was first diagnosed with depression in 2002, or more than 31 years post-service.

#Reasoning#
The record here does not contain evidence that demonstrates that the Veteran has PTSD.

#Reasoning#
Accordingly, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

#Outcome#
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
