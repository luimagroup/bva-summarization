#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, other than posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including major depression.

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty from June 1972 to June 1975.

#Procedural History#
This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2002 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Appeals (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Reno, Nevada.

#Outcome#
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.

#Evidential Support#
The Board's August 2012 decision was vacated due to outstanding VA treatment records from the Long Beach VA Medical Center (VAMC) and Las Vegas VAMC.

#Evidential Support#
The most recent records from Law Vegas are dated from November 2007, and the Board cannot point to treatment records from Long Beach.

#Reasoning#
The parties further suggested that a current VA examination may be needed, based on the complete claims file, to include a review of the above-referenced records.

#Reasoning#
After any additional records are associated with the claims file, the Veteran should be afforded a VA psychiatric examination to address the nature and likely etiology of any psychiatric disorder other than PTSD.

#Reasoning#
When the development requested has been completed, the case should be reviewed by the RO/AMC on the basis of additional evidence.
