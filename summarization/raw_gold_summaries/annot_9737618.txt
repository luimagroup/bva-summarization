#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran served on active duty with the Army from March 1964 to March 1966, including service in Vietnam from August 1965 to February 1966.

#Procedural History#
This case comes before the Board of Veterans� Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 1995 RO rating decision which denied the veteran�s claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
The claims file includes medical evidence showing a current diagnosis of PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
It appears that the RO has denied the veteran�s claim because of a lack of a verified stressor in service.

#Reasoning#
In view of the foregoing, it is the Board�s judgment that the RO should obtain additional information from the veteran regarding his alleged in-service stressors and forward this information to the USASCRUR for verification of the stressors.

#Outcome#
Accordingly, the case is hereby REMANDED

#Reasoning#
If, and only if, the RO determines that the record establishes the existence of a stressor or stressors, then the RO should arrange for the veteran to be accorded a VA psychiatric examination to determine the diagnosis of all psychiatric disorders that are present.
