#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty from May 1985 to November 1986.

#Procedural History#
This case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2005 decision by the RO in Oakland, California that denied service connection for PTSD.

#Outcome#
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.

#Evidential Support#
The Veteran underwent a VA compensation and pension examination in September 2005, in which she related her history and claimed in-service stressor to the examiner.

#Evidential Support#
The examiner diagnosed PTSD which existed prior to service and that was aggravated by MST during her active duty.

#Evidential Support#
The Board notes that the examiner gave no rationale for the opinion.

#Reasoning#
After a review of the file, the Board finds that another VA examination is warranted to ascertain the nature of any psychiatric disorder that may have existed prior to service, and if shown, whether the Veteran's preexisting psychiatric disability was aggravated by service.
