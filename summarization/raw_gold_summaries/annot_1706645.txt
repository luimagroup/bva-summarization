#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty from June 1977 to July 1997.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2008 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Houston, Texas.

#Evidential Support#
Subsequently, in June 2016, another VA opinion was obtained in which the examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's sleep apnea was incurred in or caused by his military service, or is proximately due to or the result of his service-connected PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
With regard to the aspect of the Veteran's claim pertaining to direct service connection, the examiner offered sufficient rationale, which included specific consideration of his report that he was recommended to undergo a sleep study during his retirement physical but refused as he thought it would be a waste of time, and his report of trouble sleeping and that he would sleep at two or three hour intervals on his February 1997 Report of Medical History prepared for discharge from service.

#Evidential Support#
However, such opinion does not specifically address the aggravation prong of secondary service connection and, while the examiner noted the Veteran's report that he is unable to use the CPAP machine because he associates it with a gas mask, she did not comment upon whether such results in the causation or aggravation of his sleep apnea.

#Outcome#
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:

#Reasoning#
After review of the record, please offer an addendum opinion addressing whether it at least as likely as not (i.e., a 50 percent probability or greater) that the Veteran's sleep apnea is caused OR aggravated by his PTSD.

#Reasoning#
In addressing such inquiry, the examiner should specifically comment upon whether the Veteran's inability to use the CPAP machine because he associates it with a gas mask has caused or aggravated his sleep apnea.
