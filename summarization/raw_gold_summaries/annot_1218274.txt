#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran had active service from September 1995 to February 1996 and from December 2003 to March 2005.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Columbia, South Carolina.

#Evidential Support#
Here, the VA examiner concluded that the Veteran met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD and linked the PTSD diagnosis to the Veteran's anxiety over his belief that he was in constant danger while he was in Iraq.

#Reasoning#
The Board finds that the reported stressor is consistent with the circumstances of the Veteran's service.

#Outcome#
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.
