#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 20, 1986, to March 26, 1986.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) on appeal from an August 2007 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Des Moines, Iowa, which denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

#Reasoning#
it is necessary to ensure that there is a complete record upon which to decide the Veteran's claim.

#Evidential Support#
During the examination, the Veteran reported that she had a hospital note documenting internal bleeding from forced intercourse.

#Evidential Support#
A copy of this treatment note does not appear to be associated with the claims folder.

#Outcome#
the case is REMANDED
