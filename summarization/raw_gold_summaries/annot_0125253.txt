#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran served on active duty from July 1943 to June 1947, and from February 1951 to February 1953.

#Procedural History#
This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 1999 RO decision which denied service connection for PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
The current rebuilt claims folder does not contain the veteran's service medical records.

#Evidential Support#
A VA psychiatric examination was provided in December 1998 and January 1999, and the diagnosis was depression; it was found the veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
This VA examination, however, was performed before the veteran submitted many records of past psychiatric treatment.

#Reasoning#
In view of the fact that the original claims folder has been lost, and given the duty to assist requirements of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000), and a recently enacted companion VA regulation, further development of the evidence is warranted.

#Reasoning#
Further efforts should be made to obtain pertinent records from during and after service, and another VA examination should be provided.

#Outcome#
Accordingly, the case is remanded

#Reasoning#
The RO should then review the claim for service connection for a psychiatric disorder, including PTSD.
