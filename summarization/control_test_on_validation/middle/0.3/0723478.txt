The claims folder contains service medical records, a hearing transcript, records from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and post-service medical records from the VA Medical Center in San Juan, and private medical providers.
At his retirement evaluation, the veteran denied ever having experienced frequent trouble sleeping, depression or excessive worry, loss of memory or amnesia, nervous trouble of any sort, or periods of unconsciousness.
In sum, while the veteran currently has a psychiatric disability, other than PTSD, it has not been linked to an in-service event.
Given this response, the record does not contain evidence of a verified stressor upon which a diagnosis of PTSD can be based.
