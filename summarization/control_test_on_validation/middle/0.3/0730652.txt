There is no competent diagnosis of PTSD based on a verifiable in-service stressor.
The veteran's service medical records show no complaints of or treatment for PTSD or for injuries that may have been sustained in a jeep accident.
The VA examiner stated, "I cannot confirm the specific events of the combat, but his history is believable."
If it is shown through military citation or other appropriate evidence that a veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, and the claimed stressors are related to combat, the veteran's lay testimony regarding the reported stressors must be accepted as conclusive evidence of their actual occurrence, provided the testimony is found to be satisfactory, e.g., credible and "consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of such service."
