There is no competent diagnosis of PTSD based on a verifiable in-service stressor.
In November 2002, the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) notified VA that, after conducting an extensive and thorough search, it had determined that the veteran's service personnel records either did not exist, NPRC did not have them, or that further efforts to locate the veteran's service personnel records at NPRC would be futile.
The VA examiner stated, "I cannot confirm the specific events of the combat, but his history is believable."
If it is shown through military citation or other appropriate evidence that a veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, and the claimed stressors are related to combat, the veteran's lay testimony regarding the reported stressors must be accepted as conclusive evidence of their actual occurrence, provided the testimony is found to be satisfactory, e.g., credible and "consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of such service."
