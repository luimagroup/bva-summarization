Schedule the Veteran for a new VA examination with an appropriately qualified mental health professional to determine the nature and etiology of any current acquired psychiatric disorder.
A record of the review of the claims file should be documented in the examination report.
For each diagnosed psychiatric disorder, the examiner should provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent probability or more) that the disorder had its onset in service or is otherwise etiologically related to his military service.
