The representative stated that such stressors had been verified.
He stated he arrived in Tan Son Nhut Air Force base on February 12, 1968, while the base was being mortared and rocketed.
Reportedly, on the third night, the "ammo bunker was destroyed."
Indeed, the Board can find no reference to this March 1968 stressor in any clinical record.
While the veteran has been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder, such diagnosis is not based upon an independently-verified stressor.
Accordingly, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD; hence, the reasonable doubt doctrine is not applicable.
