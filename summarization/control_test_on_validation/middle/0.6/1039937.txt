There is credible medical evidence that service-connected substance and alcohol abuse in part caused or aggravated the Veteran's peptic ulcer disease.
The attending physician noted that the Veteran had a 32 year history of alcohol and substance abuse and a history of peptic ulcer disease.
However, the Veteran continued to receive counseling and treatment for substance abuse, and mental health clinicians frequently noted the history of peptic ulcer disease as a relevant general medical factor.
The Board concludes that service connection for peptic ulcer disease is warranted on a secondary basis as a result of service-connected substance and alcohol abuse.
As substance and alcohol abuse has been determined to be service-connected and as the physician concluded that the abuse was a contributing and proximately aggravating factor, secondary service connection for peptic ulcer disease is warranted.
