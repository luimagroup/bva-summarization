If the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
Having established the occurrence of several of the Veteran's claimed in-service stressors, the Board now turns to the question of whether the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD and, if so, whether his PTSD is linked to any of his verified stressors.
While the January 2008 report does state that the Veteran meets criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD under the American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. 1994) (DSM-IV), it also makes clear
Given the findings reached during the first VA examination, as well as the reservations expressed in the report of the January 2008 VA examination as to the validity of the diagnosis, the Board finds that a new VA examination is required in order to clearly determine (1) whether the Veteran has PTSD, and (2) if yes, whether the Veteran's PTSD may be attributable to verified, in-service stressors.
