The claims folder contains service medical records, a hearing transcript, records from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and post-service medical records from the VA Medical Center in San Juan, and private medical providers.
At his retirement evaluation, the veteran denied ever having experienced frequent trouble sleeping, depression or excessive worry, loss of memory or amnesia, nervous trouble of any sort, or periods of unconsciousness.
The Board also notes that the veteran's SSA determination that the veteran became disabled, in part, due to schizophrenic, paranoid and other functional psychotic disability as of October 8, 1992 does not help the veteran's service connection claim as it is based on different standards and does not find that the veteran's psychiatric disability is related to service.
In sum, while the veteran currently has a psychiatric disability, other than PTSD, it has not been linked to an in-service event.
