The favorable opinions in this case diagnosing PTSD are based, in part, upon the Veteran's alleged stressor of having being raped during service and are rendered without any benefit of review of the claims folder.
However, the Board is of the opinion that the point of dispute in this case appears to be the examiner impressions upon interviewing the Veteran's description of symptoms which can only be resolved with an actual in person psychiatric examination.
Next, arrange for the Veteran to be afforded a VA psychiatric examination by a panel of three Board-certified psychiatrists.
At this time, only the Veteran's stressor of witnessing the death of a construction worker for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers when he got caught in a drilling rig has been established.
Determine whether the Veteran manifests PTSD according to the DSM-IV criteria, fully explaining how each criterion have been met or not met.
