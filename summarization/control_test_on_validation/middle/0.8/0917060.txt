Having established the occurrence of several of the Veteran's claimed in-service stressors, the Board now turns to the question of whether the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD and, if so, whether his PTSD is linked to any of his verified stressors.
The January 2008 VA examination report describes the Veteran's history as told by the Veteran himself, noting several inconsistencies between his current narration and the information he provided at the October 2007 examination.
As noted, even having accepted that the Veteran's claimed in-service stressors did occur, the evidence must also show that he has been diagnosed with PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. ยง 4.125, and that such diagnosis is specifically related to the in-service stressors.
Given the findings reached during the first VA examination, as well as the reservations expressed in the report of the January 2008 VA examination as to the validity of the diagnosis, the Board finds that a new VA examination is required in order to clearly determine (1) whether the Veteran has PTSD, and (2) if yes, whether the Veteran's PTSD may be attributable to verified, in-service stressors.
