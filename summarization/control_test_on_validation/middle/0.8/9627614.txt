CONTENTIONS OF APPELLANT ON APPEALThe veteran contends, in essence that he currently suffer from PTSD as a result of his service in Vietnam.
The veterans service medical records are silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of PTSD.
There was no diagnosis of PTSD rendered.
The Board notes that the veteran has been diagnosed as having PTSD on several occasions, however, the evidence of record fails to provide a clear diagnosis of the condition.
Specifically, the most recent VA examination of the veteran dated in December 1995, noted that there were no psychosis, delusions, or hallucinations, and failed to render a diagnosis of PTSD.
However, none of the diagnoses of PTSD cited by the veteran specifically relates PTSD to the identified stressors.
A diagnosis of PTSD alone is not enough to grant service connection, it must be linked to an inservice stressor.
Therefore, in the absence of a clear diagnosis of PTSD, and the lack evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed inservice stressors, the preponderance of the evidence is against the veterans claim for service connection for PTSD.
