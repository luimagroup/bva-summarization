Resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD-variously diagnosed as bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety-was incurred during active duty service.
A review of the record reflects that the Veteran filed his claim to reopen service connection for a psychiatric disorder in April 2002, and since that time, VA treatment records initially discussed several diagnoses, including a history of bipolar I versus bipolar II disorder, mood disorder not otherwise specified, bipolar disorder, and rule out bipolar I disorder.
As noted in the Board's previous remand, "the evidence of record shows that the Veteran was treated for cocaine dependence and a failed suicide attempt during his final term of service, and he was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment within two years of his separation from the last period of active service."
With regard to the Veteran's specific diagnosis of bipolar disorder, the VA examiner further noted that there was nothing to indicate that it pre-existed active military service or that this condition was permanently aggravated by subsequent service.
Furthermore, the Veteran also submitted a September 2014 statement from the Veteran's treating psychologist at VA, who determined that the Veteran's "symptoms, significantly affecting his daily functioning, have reportedly been persistent since his time in the service.
As such, the Veteran's service-connection claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD is granted.
