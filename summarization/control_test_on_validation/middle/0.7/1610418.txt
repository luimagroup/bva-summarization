As such, the only issue remaining on appeal was entitlement to an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD and anxiety disorder NOS.
After completing the above actions, the Veteran should be scheduled for a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of any current acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD and anxiety disorder NOS.
He or she should specifically indicate whether the Veteran has dysthymia, persistent depressive disorder, insomnia, and mood disorder NOS.
For each diagnosis identified other than PTSD and anxiety disorder NOS, the examiner should opine whether it is at least as likely as not that the disorder manifested in or is otherwise related to the Veteran's military service.
