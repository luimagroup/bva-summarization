The veteran claims that entitlement to service connection for PTSD due to an in-service assault.
VA will not deny a PTSD claim that is based on an inservice personal assault without first advising the claimant that evidence from sources other than the veteran's service records or evidence of behavioral changes may constitute credible supporting evidence of the stressor, further development is in order.
The RO should contact the veteran and notify him of the opportunity to furnish, or to advise VA of the potential source or sources of evidence other than his service records, or evidence of behavioral changes, that might constitute credible supporting evidence of his purported inservice stressor.
If and only if, an in-service stressor is independently verified, the RO should schedule the veteran for a psychiatric examination to determine the nature and etiology of any current PTSD.
If PTSD is diagnosed, the examiner should specify which stressor was used as a basis for the diagnosis, and the evidence which independently verifies the claimed stressor.
