The favorable opinions in this case diagnosing PTSD are based, in part, upon the Veteran's alleged stressor of having being raped during service and are rendered without any benefit of review of the claims folder.
The RO has been unable to obtain service treatment records (STRs) pertaining to the Veteran's first period of active service.
On remand, however, the Board will request that direct searches be conducted in the facilities and dates identified.
Next, arrange for the Veteran to be afforded a VA psychiatric examination by a panel of three Board-certified psychiatrists.
If PTSD is diagnosed, specify each stressor deemed of sufficient gravity to produce PTSD.
