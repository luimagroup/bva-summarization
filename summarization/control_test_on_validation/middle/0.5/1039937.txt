There is credible medical evidence that service-connected substance and alcohol abuse in part caused or aggravated the Veteran's peptic ulcer disease.
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONVA has a duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.
However, the Veteran continued to receive counseling and treatment for substance abuse, and mental health clinicians frequently noted the history of peptic ulcer disease as a relevant general medical factor.
He concluded that there were multiple causes for the disease including drug and alcohol abuse.
As substance and alcohol abuse has been determined to be service-connected and as the physician concluded that the abuse was a contributing and proximately aggravating factor, secondary service connection for peptic ulcer disease is warranted.
