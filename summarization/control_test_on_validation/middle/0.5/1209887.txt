While VA did not provide the Veteran with an examination and/or did not obtain a medical opinion, the Board finds that VA had no obligation to do so in connection with the current appeal because both the STRs and post service treatment records are completely negative for evidence of a diagnosis of PTSD or any other psychiatric disability.
As discussed in further detail below, the Veteran has failed to submit or identify any medical evidence showing a current psychiatric diagnosis of any kind.
Thus, the Board concludes that no further notice or assistance to the Veteran is required to fulfill VA's duty to assist him in the development of his service connection claim.
He asserts that because of his experiences in Vietnam he is sensitive to loud noise and has great difficulty during New Year's and July 4th celebrations.
