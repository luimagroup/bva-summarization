The December 2014 Board remand instructed the AOJ to schedule the Veteran for a VA psychological examination to determine the nature and etiology of his claimed mental disorder.
As the Veteran has presented good cause for his failure to appear at the examination, his request will be granted and another mental health examination should be scheduled in compliance with the Board's initial remand directives.
Schedule the Veteran for a new VA examination with an appropriately qualified mental health professional to determine the nature and etiology of any current acquired psychiatric disorder.
