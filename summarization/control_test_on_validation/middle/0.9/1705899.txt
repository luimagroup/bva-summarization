The Board notes that the Veteran originally filed a claim for service connection for PTSD.
Accordingly, given that the record reflects possible psychiatric diagnoses other than PTSD, the Board has amended the issue on appeal as entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, anxiety, depression, adjustment disorder, and panic disorder.
As noted in the prior Board remand, the Veteran's VA clinic records reflect diagnoses of PTSD, panic disorder, depression, depressive disorder, and anxiety disorder.
The Veteran has reported a multitude of PTSD stressors which include: 1) witnessing a soldier shoot himself in 1982 (VA clinic record dated March 2004); 2) seeing people dying including a boy blowing up himself while stationed in Germany (VA clinic record dated June 2004); 3) witnessing the decapitation of soldier "O'Brien" during a helicopter accident in 1978 while assigned with the 4th Engineer Battalion at Fort Carson, Colorado (VA Form 21-0781 received September 2008); 4) witnessing the leg of "Sgt. 1st Class Brown" being severed during a tank accident in 1982 while assigned to the 1st & 10th Charlie Company Infantry (VA Form 21-0781 received September 2008); 5) earning a bronze star for service in Desert Storm in 1990 (Private psychologist report dated May 2007); and 6) earning a bronze star for service in Grenada (Private psychologist report dated May 2007).
Consistent with Gagne and Jaquay, the Board has "built up" the Veteran's stressor details by his various statements of record, to include his reports to VA clinicians, finding the sufficient information was available for verifying the 1978 and 1982 stressors with JSRRC.
