If it is shown through military citation or other appropriate evidence that a veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, and the claimed stressors are related to combat, the veteran's lay testimony regarding the reported stressors must be accepted as conclusive evidence of their actual occurrence, provided the testimony is found to be satisfactory, e.g., credible and "consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of such service."
Although the veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD, the Board finds no credible evidence which verifies any of his claimed stressors.
Although there is evidence that the person identified by the veteran as having been killed in that accident was in fact killed in 1953, there is no indication that the veteran was present for that event.
Thus, as the veteran has failed to produce credible supporting evidence that a claimed in-service stressor actually occurred, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
