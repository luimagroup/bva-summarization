The Veteran has been diagnosed as having a personality disorder; there is no superimposed disease or injury during service that created additional disability.
The letter also notified the Veteran of the reasons for the previous denial of service connection and what evidence qualified as new and material evidence.
VA will not deny a PTSD claim that is based on in-service personal assault without first advising the claimant that evidence from sources other than the Veteran's service records or evidence of behavior changes may constitute credible supporting evidence of the stressor.
After considering the foregoing, the Board concludes that there is clear and unmistakable evidence to rebut the presumption of soundness to show that the Veteran did have depression and PTSD prior her service entrance.
