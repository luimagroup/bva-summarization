On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active service from April 1968 to March 1970.
While VA did not provide the Veteran with an examination and/or did not obtain a medical opinion, the Board finds that VA had no obligation to do so in connection with the current appeal because both the STRs and post service treatment records are completely negative for evidence of a diagnosis of PTSD or any other psychiatric disability.
As discussed in further detail below, the Veteran has failed to submit or identify any medical evidence showing a current psychiatric diagnosis of any kind.
Although it is unquestioned that the Veteran served in Vietnam during the Vietnam War era, the primary impediment to a grant of service connection in this case is the absence of medical evidence of a current psychiatric disorder.
Moreover as a clear preponderance of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD, consideration of any association between his current symptomatology and his claimed in-service stressors is not necessary.
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
