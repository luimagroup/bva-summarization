On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Huntington, West Virginia.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder with agoraphobia, and anxiety.
The Veteran served on active duty from November 1965 to November 1968.
The Veteran has current diagnoses of panic disorder with agoraphobia and depressive disorder NOS, but the most probative evidence of record does not show a diagnosis of PTSD during the pendency of the appeal.
The most probative evidence of record indicates that the Veteran's panic disorder with agoraphobia and depressive disorder NOS are etiologically related to service.
The Veteran contends that an acquired psychiatric disorder was incurred in active service.
In a June 2008 VA record, the Veteran was given a provisional diagnosis of PTSD.
In an October 2009 VA examination, the Veteran received a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia and depressive disorder NOS, but a diagnosis of PTSD was ruled out.
As such, the Board will resolve all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and find that the Veteran's panic disorder and depressive disorder are etiologically related to service.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include panic disorder with agoraphobia and depressive disorder NOS, is granted.
