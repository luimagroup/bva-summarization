On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Muskogee, Oklahoma.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from November 1965 to November 1968.
He denied any suicidal or homicidal thoughts.
He stated that he saw people killed and wounded.
On examination there was no psychosis, delusions, or hallucinations noted.
His incapacity to work and socialize was reported to be mild.
These findings were confirmed on the July 1994 VA examination.
He also indicated that he lived in constant fear of being hit.
However, none of the diagnoses of PTSD cited by the veteran specifically relates PTSD to the identified stressors.
Therefore, in the absence of a clear diagnosis of PTSD, and the lack evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed inservice stressors, the preponderance of the evidence is against the veteranÂ’s claim for service connection for PTSD.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
