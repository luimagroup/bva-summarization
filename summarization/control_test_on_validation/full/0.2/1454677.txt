On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Louisville, Kentucky.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and bipolar disorder.
The Veteran served on active duty from July 1970 to March 1972.
In July 2013 the VA was afforded a VA examination to ascertain the nature and etiology of his claimed acquired psychiatric disorder.
The examiner found that while the Veteran's reported stressor met the requirements for a DSM-IV PTSD stressor, he did not meet the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis.
Specifically, the Veteran did not report any symptoms of avoidance, re-experiencing, or hyperarousal.
The examiner noted that he had a history of mood disturbances but that these had been in remission for approximately two years.
In light of the Veteran's confirmed in-service stressor and current disorder, a medical opinion regarding the nexus of the Veteran's bipolar disorder is required.
All attempts to obtain these records should be documented in the claims file.
The claims file, including a copy of this remand, should be reviewed by the examiner.
Notify the Veteran that he must report for any scheduled examination and cooperate in the development of the claim.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
