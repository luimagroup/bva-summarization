On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Montgomery, Alabama.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder, a personality disorder, and trichotillomania.
The Veteran served on active duty from February 1978 to July 1988This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2006 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Jackson, Mississippi.
VA will not deny a PTSD claim that is based on in-service personal assault without first advising the claimant that evidence from sources other than the Veteran's service records or evidence of behavior changes may constitute credible supporting evidence of the stressor.
For rationale, it was noted that the depression had its roots in learning and early childhood experiences.
The Board does not find the November 2005 opinion that supports the Veteran's claim persuasive.
Thus, the Board finds them to be persuasive.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is denied.
