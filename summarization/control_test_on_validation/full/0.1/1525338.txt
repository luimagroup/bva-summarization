On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Los Angeles, California.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had honorable active service from August 1980 to August 1984 and from April 1985 to September 1985.
Resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD-variously diagnosed as bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety-was incurred during active duty service.
Given the favorable nature of the Board's decision herein, any error in notice or assistance is harmless.
However, the VA examiner does not discuss the in-service symptoms and in-patient treatment for depression, nor does the VA examiner provide any further rationale for his negative nexus conclusion.
The examiner explained that the onset did not occur during service;
Furthermore, the Veteran also submitted a September 2014 statement from the Veteran's treating psychologist at VA, who determined that the Veteran's "symptoms, significantly affecting his daily functioning, have reportedly been persistent since his time in the service.
This competent evidence strongly supports a finding of in-service incurrence.
Service connection for a psychiatric disorder other than PTSD is granted.
