On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Louisville, Kentucky.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from April 1966 to March 1970.
That is, the Board finds that the veteran has presented a claim which is not implausible when his contentions and the evidence of the record are viewed in the light most favorable to that claim.
However, in the report from an August 1995 VA compensation and pension examination of the veteran, the examining physician opined that the veteran's primary diagnosis was not post-traumatic stress disorder, but instead an organic syndrome secondary to chronic substance abuse and a gunshot wound to the head.
In addition, the veteran stated that he saw many dead bodies, was part of a group of men that were ambushed resulting in two casualties, saw troops land in mine fields, witnessed a woman being thrown from a helicopter, was part of a unit which had napalm dumped upon it, witnessed the burning of a Vietnamese national, and shot a Vietnamese woman after she tried to stab him.
Inasmuch as the preponderance of the evidence, as discussed above, is against a finding of a current credible diagnosis of PTSD, his claim for service connection for PTSD does not meet one of the requirements of 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.304(f).
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is denied.
