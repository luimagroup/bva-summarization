On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Salt Lake City, Utah.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for arrhythmia, claimed as secondary to medication prescribed as treatment for post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from January 1965 to November 1967.
He reported that since being off of the Nardil for two weeks, he experienced almost hourly palpitations associated with shortness of breath and occasional chest burning.
In any case, the veteran was reassured that the nature of his arrhythmia was benign.
The Board also finds that the medical evidence fails to demonstrate evidence of additional disability arising from VA medical treatment, such that a grant of service connection would be warranted under the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. ยง 1151 (West 1991 & Supp. 1999).
Service connection is denied for arrhythmia, claimed as secondary to medications prescribed as treatment for service-connected PTSD.
