On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in San Juan, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran is not shown to have a diagnosis of PTSD due to any verified event during his period of military service.
Therefore, the Board finds that he was provided with the notice required by the VCAA.
The claims folder contains service medical records, a hearing transcript, records from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and post-service medical records from the VA Medical Center in San Juan, and private medical providers.
In sum, while the veteran currently has a psychiatric disability, other than PTSD, it has not been linked to an in-service event.
Given this response, the record does not contain evidence of a verified stressor upon which a diagnosis of PTSD can be based.
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, is denied.
