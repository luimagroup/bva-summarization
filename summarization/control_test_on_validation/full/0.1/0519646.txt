On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Hartford, Connecticut.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a chronic acquired psychiatric disorder, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active duty service from December 1977 to September 1979.
If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.
If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
The examiner indicated that there was no clear traumatic event.
The doctor concluded that this affected her mental health and moreover, she experienced periods of depression.
The Board also has given consideration to the veteran's reluctance to attend VA examinations due to an alleged unpleasant past experience, as evidenced by a May 1999 Report of Contact.
The appeal is granted.
