On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active service from April 1968 to March 1970.
While VA did not provide the Veteran with an examination and/or did not obtain a medical opinion, the Board finds that VA had no obligation to do so in connection with the current appeal because both the STRs and post service treatment records are completely negative for evidence of a diagnosis of PTSD or any other psychiatric disability.
To establish entitlement to service connection for PTSD, the record must contain the following:  (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.
He asserts that because of his experiences in Vietnam he is sensitive to loud noise and has great difficulty during New Year's and July 4th celebrations.
In reaching this conclusion, the Board has not overlooked the Veteran's contentions.
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
