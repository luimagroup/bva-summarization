This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a July 2003 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Cleveland, Ohio.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active service from May 1952 to April 1954.
There is no competent diagnosis of PTSD based on a verifiable in-service stressor.
The veteran's service medical records show no complaints of or treatment for PTSD or for injuries that may have been sustained in a jeep accident.
If it is shown through military citation or other appropriate evidence that a veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, and the claimed stressors are related to combat, the veteran's lay testimony regarding the reported stressors must be accepted as conclusive evidence of their actual occurrence, provided the testimony is found to be satisfactory, e.g., credible and "consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of such service."
Although there is evidence that the person identified by the veteran as having been killed in that accident was in fact killed in 1953, there is no indication that the veteran was present for that event.
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.
