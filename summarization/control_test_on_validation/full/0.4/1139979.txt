On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Nashville, Tennessee.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include bipolar disorder, depression, schizoaffective disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran was in the United States Navy from August 1976 to March 1984 but with only one year, four months, and 12 days of active service due to unauthorized absences from October 28, 1977 to April 30, 1978 and from May 3, 1978 to January 9, 1984.
The Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD, as well as claims of entitlement to service connection for bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder, has been incorporated into his current appeal.
The AMC should obtain all records from Greenleaf where he was treated for alcoholism in 1992 and/or 1993, from CRT, the Athens Regional Center Emergency Room for treatment in early January 2007, from Dr.
Any such records so obtained should be associated with the appellant's VA claims folder.
The examiner must opine whether the Veteran's current psychiatric disorder clearly and unmistakably preexisted active service, and whether it is also clear and unmistakable that there was no increase in disability during service (during the active service, not the unauthorized absences) or that any increase in disability was due to the natural progress of the preexisting psychiatric disorder.
After the development requested, the RO should review the examination report to ensure that it is in complete compliance with the directives of this REMAND.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
