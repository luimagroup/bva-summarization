On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Huntington, West Virginia.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder with agoraphobia, and anxiety.
The Veteran served on active duty from November 1965 to November 1968.
The Veteran has current diagnoses of panic disorder with agoraphobia and depressive disorder NOS, but the most probative evidence of record does not show a diagnosis of PTSD during the pendency of the appeal.
However, there are specific circumstances in which lay testimony may be sufficient to establish a claimed stressor if, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service.
The Veteran contends that an acquired psychiatric disorder was incurred in active service.
However, subsequent VA examinations have not revealed a diagnosis of PTSD.
As such, the Board finds that there is credible evidence that an in-service event occurred.
The Board finds that the examiner is competent, and the opinion is credible.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include panic disorder with agoraphobia and depressive disorder NOS, is granted.
