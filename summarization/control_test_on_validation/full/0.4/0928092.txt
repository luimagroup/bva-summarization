On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in New Orleans, Louisiana.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active military service from December 1973 to December 1974 and from March 1981 to April 1983.
The favorable opinions in this case diagnosing PTSD are based, in part, upon the Veteran's alleged stressor of having being raped during service and are rendered without any benefit of review of the claims folder.
