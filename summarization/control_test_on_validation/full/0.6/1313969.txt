On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Montgomery, Alabama.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder, a personality disorder, and trichotillomania.
The Veteran served on active duty from February 1978 to July 1988This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2006 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Jackson, Mississippi.
The Veteran has been diagnosed as having a personality disorder; there is no superimposed disease or injury during service that created additional disability.
The letter also notified the Veteran of the reasons for the previous denial of service connection and what evidence qualified as new and material evidence.
VA will not deny a PTSD claim that is based on in-service personal assault without first advising the claimant that evidence from sources other than the Veteran's service records or evidence of behavior changes may constitute credible supporting evidence of the stressor.
Thus, the Board finds them to be persuasive.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is denied.
