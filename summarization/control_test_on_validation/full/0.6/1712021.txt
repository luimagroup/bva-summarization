On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Huntington, West Virginia.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder with agoraphobia, and anxiety.
The Veteran served on active duty from November 1965 to November 1968.
The Veteran has current diagnoses of panic disorder with agoraphobia and depressive disorder NOS, but the most probative evidence of record does not show a diagnosis of PTSD during the pendency of the appeal.
The Veteran contends that an acquired psychiatric disorder was incurred in active service.
Preliminarily, the Board notes that the evidence does not suggest, nor does the Veteran assert, that he was engaged in combat with the enemy or that his claimed PTSD is related to combat.
In a June 2008 VA record, the Veteran was given a provisional diagnosis of PTSD.
In an October 2009 VA examination, the Veteran received a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia and depressive disorder NOS, but a diagnosis of PTSD was ruled out.
The Board finds that the examiner is competent, and the opinion is credible.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include panic disorder with agoraphobia and depressive disorder NOS, is granted.
