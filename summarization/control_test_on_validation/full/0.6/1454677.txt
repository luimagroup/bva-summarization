On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Louisville, Kentucky.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and bipolar disorder.
The Veteran served on active duty from July 1970 to March 1972.
Specifically, the Veteran did not report any symptoms of avoidance, re-experiencing, or hyperarousal.
The examiner noted that he had a history of mood disturbances but that these had been in remission for approximately two years.
Further, the examiner stated that there was no discernible nexus between the Veteran's mood disturbances and his in-service stressor.
Additionally, a January 2009 report assessment and plan section indicates that the Veteran was to be treated for bipolar disorder and referred him to mental health services.
The Board finds that the proximity of the Veteran's treatment for bipolar disorder, coupled with the July 2013 examiner's notation that the Veteran continued to experience symptoms as recently as 2011, is evidence of a current psychological disorder.
In light of the Veteran's confirmed in-service stressor and current disorder, a medical opinion regarding the nexus of the Veteran's bipolar disorder is required.
While the 2013 examiner did opine that there was no discernible nexus between the Veteran's mood disturbances and his in-service stressor, this opinion is not supported by any rationale and is thus inadequate for VA purposes.
Thereafter, schedule the Veteran for an appropriate VA examination to assess the nature and etiology of his bipolar disorder.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
