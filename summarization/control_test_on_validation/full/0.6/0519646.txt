On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Hartford, Connecticut.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a chronic acquired psychiatric disorder, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active duty service from December 1977 to September 1979.
If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.
If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
The veteran claimed that she has PTSD due to the sexual harassment she was subjected to in service.
The Board asked that the veteran be scheduled for a VA examination to determine whether any current psychiatric disorder is due to the veteran's diabetes or any other service-connected disability, or if any pre-existing psychiatric disorder was aggravated by one or more service-connected disabilities.
However, the fact that the veteran's employment situation could have contributed to her depression, does not preclude the veteran's chronic acquired psychiatric disorder from being proximately due to or the result of her service-connected diabetes.
The appeal is granted.
