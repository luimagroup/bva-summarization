On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in New Orleans, Louisiana.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from March 1967 to February 1970, including service in the Republic of Vietnam.
If the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
The evidence required to support the occurrence of an in-service stressor for PTSD varies "depending on whether or not the Veteran was 'engaged in combat with the enemy'.
In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran's claimed stressors are somewhat related to combat, but the Veteran was a supply clerk in service and there is no indication he engaged in combat with the enemy.
The record must contain service records or other corroborative evidence that substantiates or verifies the Veteran's testimony or statements as to the occurrence of the claimed stressors.
The examiner noted that the Veteran had apparently received a diagnosis of PTSD from a clinic in Lafayette, but the records were not available to him.
Lafayette General Hospital and did not otherwise comment on the 1997 to 2002 VA treatment records showing PTSD, depression and other mental health treatment, or the March 2006 VA treatment record showing a diagnosis of PTSD.
The examiner should elicit as much detail as possible from the Veteran as to such claimed stressors, e.g., locations, dates, and identities of individuals involved.
Then, the examiner should consider the Veteran's alleged in-service stressors for the purpose of determining whether such stressors were severe enough to have caused the current psychiatric symptoms, and whether the diagnostic criteria to support the diagnosis of PTSD have been satisfied by the in-service stressors.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
