On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Nashville, Tennessee.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include bipolar disorder, depression, schizoaffective disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran was in the United States Navy from August 1976 to March 1984 but with only one year, four months, and 12 days of active service due to unauthorized absences from October 28, 1977 to April 30, 1978 and from May 3, 1978 to January 9, 1984.
The Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD, as well as claims of entitlement to service connection for bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder, has been incorporated into his current appeal.
A March 1984 service personnel record shows that the United States Navy was unable to locate the appellant's health and dental records due to his lengthy periods of unauthorized absence.
The RO should contact the Social Security Administration in order to obtain, if available, any records pertaining to the Veteran's disability benefits from that agency.
The examiner must opine whether the Veteran's current psychiatric disorder clearly and unmistakably preexisted active service, and whether it is also clear and unmistakable that there was no increase in disability during service (during the active service, not the unauthorized absences) or that any increase in disability was due to the natural progress of the preexisting psychiatric disorder.
If the examiner concludes that the disorder did not exist prior to service, an opinion should be rendered as to whether the disorder had onset during active service or instead had onset during a period of unauthorized absence.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
