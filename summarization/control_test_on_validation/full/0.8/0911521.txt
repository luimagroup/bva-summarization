On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in New Orleans, Louisiana.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from March 1967 to February 1970, including service in the Republic of Vietnam.
If the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
The evidence required to support the occurrence of an in-service stressor for PTSD varies "depending on whether or not the Veteran was 'engaged in combat with the enemy'.
The Board has reviewed the Veteran's service personnel records, but finds no indication that he was exposed to combat and no information to confirm his claimed stressors.
In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran's claimed stressors are somewhat related to combat, but the Veteran was a supply clerk in service and there is no indication he engaged in combat with the enemy.
The record must contain service records or other corroborative evidence that substantiates or verifies the Veteran's testimony or statements as to the occurrence of the claimed stressors.
As a result, the Board is of the opinion that the Veteran should be afforded another VA examination to determine the etiology of any such claimed psychological disorder found to be present, to include PTSD and its relationship to the Veteran's verified stressors.
The examiner should elicit as much detail as possible from the Veteran as to such claimed stressors, e.g., locations, dates, and identities of individuals involved.
The Veteran's claims files must be made available to the examiner in conjunction with the examination, and the examination report should indicate the Veteran's medical records were reviewed, including the July 1999 Lafayette Hospital record showing a diagnosis of PTSD, as well as 1997-2002 VA treatment records showing mental health treatment and PTSD and the March 2007 VA treatment record showing PTSD.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
