On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in San Juan, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran is not shown to have a diagnosis of PTSD due to any verified event during his period of military service.
There is also no evidence of a nexus between the veteran's current psychiatric disability and service.
The Board also notes that the veteran's SSA determination that the veteran became disabled, in part, due to schizophrenic, paranoid and other functional psychotic disability as of October 8, 1992 does not help the veteran's service connection claim as it is based on different standards and does not find that the veteran's psychiatric disability is related to service.
In sum, while the veteran currently has a psychiatric disability, other than PTSD, it has not been linked to an in-service event.
The preponderance of the evidence is against a finding that the veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. ยง 4.125, and as such, there is no medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, is denied.
