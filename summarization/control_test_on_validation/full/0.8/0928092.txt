On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in New Orleans, Louisiana.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active military service from December 1973 to December 1974 and from March 1981 to April 1983.
The favorable opinions in this case diagnosing PTSD are based, in part, upon the Veteran's alleged stressor of having being raped during service and are rendered without any benefit of review of the claims folder.
However, the Board is of the opinion that the point of dispute in this case appears to be the examiner impressions upon interviewing the Veteran's description of symptoms which can only be resolved with an actual in person psychiatric examination.
Next, arrange for the Veteran to be afforded a VA psychiatric examination by a panel of three Board-certified psychiatrists.
At this time, only the Veteran's stressor of witnessing the death of a construction worker for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers when he got caught in a drilling rig has been established.
Determine whether the Veteran manifests PTSD according to the DSM-IV criteria, fully explaining how each criterion have been met or not met.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
