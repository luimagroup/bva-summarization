On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Boston, Massachusetts.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from April 1971 to November 1972.
VA will not deny a PTSD claim that is based on an inservice personal assault without first advising the claimant that evidence from sources other than the veteran's service records or evidence of behavioral changes may constitute credible supporting evidence of the stressor, further development is in order.
Further, the veteran's case would be stronger if he provided additional details concerning the claimed assault which would independently verify the claimed in-service stressor.
The RO should contact the veteran and notify him of the opportunity to furnish, or to advise VA of the potential source or sources of evidence other than his service records, or evidence of behavioral changes, that might constitute credible supporting evidence of his purported inservice stressor.
If and only if, an in-service stressor is independently verified, the RO should schedule the veteran for a psychiatric examination to determine the nature and etiology of any current PTSD.
If PTSD is diagnosed, the examiner should specify which stressor was used as a basis for the diagnosis, and the evidence which independently verifies the claimed stressor.
In view of the foregoing, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:
