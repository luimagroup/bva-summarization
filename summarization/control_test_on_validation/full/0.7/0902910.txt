On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Atlanta, Georgia.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from September 1967 to June 1970.
VA notified the veteran in correspondence dated in January and February 2004 of the information and evidence needed to substantiate and complete a claim for service connection for PTSD, to include notice of what part of that evidence is to be provided by the claimant, notice of what part VA will attempt to obtain, and the need for the veteran to provide specific information regarding his in-service stressors.
VA did not provide the veteran with an examination in connection with his claim for service connection for PTSD.
The veteran's service treatment records do not show a diagnosis of PTSD.
The Board does not agree with the veteran that the after-the-fact diagnosis of PTSD meets
The fact that there is no diagnosis of PTSD in service is not, however, outcome determinative.
Accordingly, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD; hence, the reasonable doubt doctrine is not applicable.
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
