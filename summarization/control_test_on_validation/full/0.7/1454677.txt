On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Louisville, Kentucky.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and bipolar disorder.
The Veteran served on active duty from July 1970 to March 1972.
Further, the examiner stated that there was no discernible nexus between the Veteran's mood disturbances and his in-service stressor.
The evidence also reflects that the Veteran has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder in the past.
Additionally, a January 2009 report assessment and plan section indicates that the Veteran was to be treated for bipolar disorder and referred him to mental health services.
The Board finds that the proximity of the Veteran's treatment for bipolar disorder, coupled with the July 2013 examiner's notation that the Veteran continued to experience symptoms as recently as 2011, is evidence of a current psychological disorder.
In light of the Veteran's confirmed in-service stressor and current disorder, a medical opinion regarding the nexus of the Veteran's bipolar disorder is required.
While the 2013 examiner did opine that there was no discernible nexus between the Veteran's mood disturbances and his in-service stressor, this opinion is not supported by any rationale and is thus inadequate for VA purposes.
As such, remand is necessary to obtain an opinion as to the etiology of the Veteran's bipolar disorder.
Thereafter, schedule the Veteran for an appropriate VA examination to assess the nature and etiology of his bipolar disorder.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
