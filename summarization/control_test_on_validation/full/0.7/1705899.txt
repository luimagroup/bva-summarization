On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Indianapolis, Indiana.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active military service, including active duty and active duty for training from June 1975 to July 1978, October 1978 to November 1982, and from December 1986 to October 1992.
As noted in the prior Board remand, the Veteran's VA clinic records reflect diagnoses of PTSD, panic disorder, depression, depressive disorder, and anxiety disorder.
The Veteran has reported a multitude of PTSD stressors which include: 1) witnessing a soldier shoot himself in 1982 (VA clinic record dated March 2004); 2) seeing people dying including a boy blowing up himself while stationed in Germany (VA clinic record dated June 2004); 3) witnessing the decapitation of soldier "O'Brien" during a helicopter accident in 1978 while assigned with the 4th Engineer Battalion at Fort Carson, Colorado (VA Form 21-0781 received September 2008); 4) witnessing the leg of "Sgt. 1st Class Brown" being severed during a tank accident in 1982 while assigned to the 1st & 10th Charlie Company Infantry (VA Form 21-0781 received September 2008); 5) earning a bronze star for service in Desert Storm in 1990 (Private psychologist report dated May 2007); and 6) earning a bronze star for service in Grenada (Private psychologist report dated May 2007).
Consistent with Gagne and Jaquay, the Board has "built up" the Veteran's stressor details by his various statements of record, to include his reports to VA clinicians, finding the sufficient information was available for verifying the 1978 and 1982 stressors with JSRRC.
The Veteran should once again be requested to provide additional information regarding the following alleged PTSD stressors:   a) the location, unit of assignment and name of the soldier who shot himself in 1982;
For any other acquired psychiatric disorder diagnosed since service even if currently asymptomatic, opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (a 50 percent or higher probability) that such disorder had its onset during or was otherwise related to his service?
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
