On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Winston- Salem, North Carolina.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from October 1969 to April 1972.
If the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
Having established the occurrence of several of the Veteran's claimed in-service stressors, the Board now turns to the question of whether the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD and, if so, whether his PTSD is linked to any of his verified stressors.
As noted, even having accepted that the Veteran's claimed in-service stressors did occur, the evidence must also show that he has been diagnosed with PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. ยง 4.125, and that such diagnosis is specifically related to the in-service stressors.
Given the findings reached during the first VA examination, as well as the reservations expressed in the report of the January 2008 VA examination as to the validity of the diagnosis, the Board finds that a new VA examination is required in order to clearly determine (1) whether the Veteran has PTSD, and (2) if yes, whether the Veteran's PTSD may be attributable to verified, in-service stressors.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.
