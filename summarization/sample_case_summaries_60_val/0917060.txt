On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Winston- Salem, North Carolina.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from October 1969 to April 1972.
If the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
The above stressors are therefore considered verified for the purposes of attempting to establish service connection for PTSD.
Given the findings reached during the first VA examination, as well as the reservations expressed in the report of the January 2008 VA examination as to the validity of the diagnosis, the Board finds that a new VA examination is required in order to clearly determine (1) whether the Veteran has PTSD, and (2) if yes, whether the Veteran's PTSD may be attributable to verified, in-service stressors.
The examiner should report a multi-axial diagnosis, identifying all current psychiatric disorders.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.
