On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Hartford, Connecticut.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a chronic acquired psychiatric disorder, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active duty service from December 1977 to September 1979.
If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.
If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
The veteran's medical evidence does not indicate that she has a diagnosis of PTSD.
The veteran's July 1997 VA PTSD examination found that the veteran did not meet the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis.
VA progress notes dated in December 1997 showed the veteran was depressed due to termination of her job, but was stable.
The appeal is granted.
