On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Huntington, West Virginia.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (NOS).
The Veteran had active service in the United States Army from May 1969 to November 1971.
As such, the only issue remaining on appeal was entitlement to an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD and anxiety disorder NOS.
After completing the above actions, the Veteran should be scheduled for a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of any current acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD and anxiety disorder NOS.
He or she should specifically indicate whether the Veteran has dysthymia, persistent depressive disorder, insomnia, and mood disorder NOS.
(The term "at least as likely as not" does not mean within the realm of medical possibility, but rather that the medical evidence both for and against a conclusion is so evenly divided that it is as medically sound to find favor of conclusion as it is to find against it).
The appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ. VA will notify the Veteran if further action is required.
