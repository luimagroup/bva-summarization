On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in New Orleans, Louisiana.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active military service from December 1973 to December 1974 and from March 1981 to April 1983.
Therefore, the only issue before the Board is a claim of service connection for PTSD.
Historically, the Veteran's psychiatric impairment since 1975 has eluded a consistent diagnosis.
This diagnosis was based upon interview, mental status examination and psychological testing.
The examiner opined that, even though the Veteran had some symptoms of PTSD, the Veteran did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD.
If PTSD is diagnosed, specify each stressor deemed of sufficient gravity to produce PTSD.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC. VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.
