On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in San Juan, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran is not shown to have a diagnosis of PTSD due to any verified event during his period of military service.
It is the responsibility of the BVA, . . . to assess the credibility and weight to be given to evidence."
The Board also notes that the veteran's SSA determination that the veteran became disabled, in part, due to schizophrenic, paranoid and other functional psychotic disability as of October 8, 1992 does not help the veteran's service connection claim as it is based on different standards and does not find that the veteran's psychiatric disability is related to service.
If the claimant did not engage in combat with the enemy, or the claimed stressors are not related to combat, then the claimant's testimony alone is not sufficient to establish the occurrence of the claimed stressors, and his testimony must be corroborated by credible supporting evidence.
Without a verified stressor, the assessments and history of PTSD have no probative value.
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, is denied.
