On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Reno, Nevada.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, other than posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including major depression.
The Veteran served on active duty from June 1972 to June 1975.
The Veteran was subsequently notified that the May 2005 VLJ was no longer employed by the Board and was afforded the opportunity for a new hearing; he elected to take the opportunity.
The RO should obtain all treatment records from the Long Beach VAMC, and records dated since November 2007 from the Las Vegas VAMC.
After any additional records are associated with the claims file, the Veteran should be afforded a VA psychiatric examination to address the nature and likely etiology of any psychiatric disorder other than PTSD.
The examiner is requested to offer comments and an opinion addressing whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent probability or greater) that any psychiatric disorder other than PTSD is due to an injury or other event or incident of the Veteran's period of active service.
After the development requested has been completed, the RO/AMC should review the examination report to ensure that it is in compliance with the directives of this REMAND.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC. VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.
