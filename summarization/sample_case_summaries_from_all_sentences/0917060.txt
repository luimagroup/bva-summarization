On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Winston- Salem, North Carolina.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from October 1969 to April 1972.
Veteran testified that he was on call to go to the riots, but he did not end up having to go.
He said that there were over 60 police cars destroyed, overturned, and burned, and a lot of policemen got hurt.
Having established the occurrence of several of the Veteran's claimed in-service stressors, the Board now turns to the question of whether the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD and, if so, whether his PTSD is linked to any of his verified stressors.
The examiner should report a multi-axial diagnosis, identifying all current psychiatric disorders.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC. VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.
