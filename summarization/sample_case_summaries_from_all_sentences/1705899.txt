On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Indianapolis, Indiana.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran had active military service, including active duty and active duty for training from June 1975 to July 1978, October 1978 to November 1982, and from December 1986 to October 1992.
As noted in the prior Board remand, the Veteran's VA clinic records reflect diagnoses of PTSD, panic disorder, depression, depressive disorder, and anxiety disorder.
Consistent with Gagne and Jaquay, the Board has "built up" the Veteran's stressor details by his various statements of record, to include his reports to VA clinicians, finding the sufficient information was available for verifying the 1978 and 1982 stressors with JSRRC.
The Veteran should once again be requested to provide additional information regarding the following alleged PTSD stressors: a) the location, unit of assignment and name of the soldier who shot himself in 1982;
If the examiner is unavailable, forward the claims folder to a similarly qualified examiner.
For any other acquired psychiatric disorder diagnosed since service even if currently asymptomatic, opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (a 50 percent or higher probability) that such disorder had its onset during or was otherwise related to his service?
The appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ. VA will notify the Veteran if further action, on his part, is required.
