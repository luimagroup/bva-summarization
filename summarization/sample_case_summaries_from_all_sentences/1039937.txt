On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Huntington, West Virginia.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for peptic ulcer disease including as secondary to service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from April 1972 to May 1975.
There is credible medical evidence that service-connected substance and alcohol abuse in part caused or aggravated the Veteran's peptic ulcer disease.
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION VA has a duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.
However, the Veteran continued to receive counseling and treatment for substance abuse, and mental health clinicians frequently noted the history of peptic ulcer disease as a relevant general medical factor.
He concluded that there were multiple causes for the disease including drug and alcohol abuse.
As substance and alcohol abuse has been determined to be service-connected and as the physician concluded that the abuse was a contributing and proximately aggravating factor, secondary service connection for peptic ulcer disease is warranted.
Service connection for peptic ulcer disease is granted, subject to the legal criteria governing the payment of monetary benefits.
