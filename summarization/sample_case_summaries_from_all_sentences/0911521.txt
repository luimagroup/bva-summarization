On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in New Orleans, Louisiana.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from March 1967 to February 1970, including service in the Republic of Vietnam.
Requisite additional evidence may be obtained from sources other than the Veteran's service medical records.
In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran's claimed stressors are somewhat related to combat, but the Veteran was a supply clerk in service and there is no indication he engaged in combat with the enemy.
A medical opinion diagnosing PTSD does not suffice to verify the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressors.
Veteran's representative relates to the verification of the alleged mortar and rocket fire stressors experienced by the Veteran.
One of the available full articles, the Columbia Missourian, dated January 26, 1968, reports on how An Khe was attacked with mortar fire and hostile troops and demolition squads infiltrated the An Khe airfields and destroyed military equipment. U.S. troops were noted as killed and wounded in these attacks.
There is evidence both for and against the verification of the Veteran's in-service stressors.
The examination focused on discussing the Veteran's stroke and the examiner opined that he was not in the position to comment on the validity of the Veteran's previous diagnoses of PTSD.
Lafayette General Hospital and did not otherwise comment on the 1997 to 2002 VA treatment records showing PTSD, depression and other mental health treatment, or the March 2006 VA treatment record showing a diagnosis of PTSD.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC. VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.
