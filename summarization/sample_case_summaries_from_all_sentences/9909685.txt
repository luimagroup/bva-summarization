On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Louisville, Kentucky.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from April 1966 to March 1970.
FINDING OF FACT A clear diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder has not been demonstrated.
However, in the report from an August 1995 VA compensation and pension examination of the veteran, the examining physician opined that the veteran's primary diagnosis was not post-traumatic stress disorder, but instead an organic syndrome secondary to chronic substance abuse and a gunshot wound to the head.
The veteran's service medical records are negative for evidence of treatment of the veteran for complaints of nervousness or emotional trauma.
In addition, the veteran stated that he saw many dead bodies, was part of a group of men that were ambushed resulting in two casualties, saw troops land in mine fields, witnessed a woman being thrown from a helicopter, was part of a unit which had napalm dumped upon it, witnessed the burning of a Vietnamese national, and shot a Vietnamese woman after she tried to stab him.
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is denied.
