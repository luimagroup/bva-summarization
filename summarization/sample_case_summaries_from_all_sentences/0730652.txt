This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a July 2003 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Cleveland, Ohio.
The issue is Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active service from May 1952 to April 1954.
The RO also has made repeated attempts to obtain the veteran's service personnel records in order to attempt verification of the veteran's claimed in-service stressors.
Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with VA regulations; a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.
The diagnosis was chronic PTSD.
Although there is evidence that the person identified by the veteran as having been killed in that accident was in fact killed in 1953, there is no indication that the veteran was present for that event.
Hence, the appeal is denied.
