Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from February 1967 to September 1969.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) from an August 2011 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO) in Nashville, Tennessee.
Nonetheless, following a thorough examination of the Veteran, the examiner found that the Veteran demonstrated stable and adequate psychosocial functioning, and reported good relationships with family and friends.
The examiner concluded that although the Veteran described symptoms of PTSD, he did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, or for any psychiatric disorder.
In light of the clinical findings of the August 2011 VA examination and the absence of favorable competent medical evidence of record showing a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.
Therefore, the most probative evidence of record reflects that the Veteran lacks a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, including PTSD under the DSM-IV, during the appeals period.
For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, and the claim must be denied.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.
