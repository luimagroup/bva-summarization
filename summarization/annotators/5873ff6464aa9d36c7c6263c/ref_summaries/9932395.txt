Entitlement to service connection for a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from July 1968 to July 1970.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following an October 1996 decision of the Buffalo, New York, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) which denied a claim of service connection for PTSD.
In addition, at an October 1997 VA examination, after the veteran had discussed his Vietnam experiences (i.e., having engaged in firefights, being wounded by shrapnel, having a friend killed, being on a convoy that was ambushed, and seeing people killed), the examiner noted that he had read the claims file and formed an opinion that the veteran suffered from "schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type with comorbidity of [PTSD] resulting from the combat experience."
Additionally, the evidence of record includes medical opinions that specifically relate his PTSD to the foregoing in-service experience.
The Board is also satisfied that, with reasonable doubt resolved in the veteran's favor, the evidence supports a grant of service connection.
Given that the October 1997 evaluation report showing PTSD reflected extensive examination and testing, given that examiners who diagnose PTSD must find that the traumatic event is being re-experienced in some way, and because the examiners in this case appear to rely on the existence of the claimed in-service event in reaching the diagnosis of PTSD, the Board finds that the evidence is in relative equipoise on this point.
With application of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine, a grant of service connection is warranted.
Service connection for PTSD is granted.
