Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from October 1968 to May 1970.
This matter is on appeal from an April 2005 decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.
In April 2005, the RO recognized that the Veteran had been diagnosed with PTSD by some treating physicians, but denied the Veteran's claim on the basis that his stressors could not be corroborated unless he could provide more accurate information.
Specifically, while the VA examiner at that time did not diagnose PTSD, the Veteran did not articulate his stressors until September 2006.
Therefore, there is relevant evidence that is now part of the record that the examiner did not consider.
Finally, the Board notes that the Veteran is in receipt of disability benefits from the Social Security Administration (SSA) since 1999, but there is no indication that there has been an attempt to acquire the treatment records the SSA may possess.
Given the likelihood that these records are relevant to the issues on appeal, an attempt should be made to acquire them.
