Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as due to in-service herbicide exposure and as secondary to service-connected diabetes mellitus and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from June 1967 to June 1969.
This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2008 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Louis, Missouri.
The appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).
As noted in the previous remand, the Board referred to the Joint Motion which noted that the Secretary has acknowledged that there is "limited or suggestive evidence of an association between hypertension and exposure to herbicides."
The examiner stated that "First of all there is no correlation between agent orange and hypertension."
Given the acknowledgement by the Secretary that there is some evidence of an association, this opinion is inadequate as based on an inaccurate premise.
The Board finds another opinion is necessary which considers the evidence.
Finally, it is unclear as to whether the Veteran's service treatment records are complete.
