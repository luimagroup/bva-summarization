Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from August 1969 to March 1972 and from June 1979 to December 1991.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2001 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO) in Montgomery, Alabama.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.
However, the May 2008 letter made no mention of the Veteran's subsequent statement regarding his alleged in-service stressor.
Specifically, VA received a statement from the Veteran in April 2008 providing VA with the location and nature of his alleged in-service stressors.
The August 2008 JSRRC report makes no mention of the Veteran's April 2008 statement.
Therefore, it does not appear that this evidence was considered when denying the Veteran's claim.
However, the record contains a much more detailed statement from the Veteran that does not appear to have been considered.
An additional attempt to verify the Veteran's alleged in-service stressors must be made.
