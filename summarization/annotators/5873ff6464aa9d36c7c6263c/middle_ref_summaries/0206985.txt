With regard to the question of whether the veteran participated in combat with the enemy during service, the Board observes that he did not have service during a period of war and was not stationed overseas at any time during service.
The Board notes that the veteran's service medical records are entirely negative for documentation of his claimed stressors.
While the veteran was treated for right upper extremity symptomatology during service, this was attributed to sports injuries at the time of treatment.
Given the limited information provided by the veteran and the RO's attempts to obtain service department information, the Board finds that sufficient efforts have been made to verify his stressors and that, even though no stressors were verified, there is no reasonable basis for further stressor development.
However, the evidence of record does not in any way reflect participation in combat with the enemy, and there is no evidence showing that the veteran's current diagnosis of PTSD is based upon a verified stressor from service.
As such, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
