Although the appellant received a diagnosis of PTSD during hospitalization in 1995 at a VA medical facility and the record includes subsequent diagnoses of PTSD, service connection may not be granted for PTSD unless all of the requirements of 38 C.F.R. ï¿½ 3.304(f) have been fulfilled, including, for a stressor or stressors not related to combat, credible supporting evidence of the occurrence of the claimed stressor(s) on which the diagnosis of PTSD was based by the psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health professional who rendered it.
There is no such credible supporting evidence in this case of the occurrence of either of the appellant's two claimed in-service stressors.
The preponderance of the evidence of record is against a grant of service connection for PTSD.
VA has done everything reasonably possible to assist the veteran with respect the claims decided herein.
Service medical records and post-service medical records have been associated with the claims file and efforts were made to officially confirm the stressors described by the veteran.
