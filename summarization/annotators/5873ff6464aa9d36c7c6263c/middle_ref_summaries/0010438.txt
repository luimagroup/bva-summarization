The record contains opinions from several VA mental health specialists indicating that either the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD are not fulfilled in this case, or that diagnoses other than PTSD, such as depression, dysthymia, and alcohol dependence, are warranted instead.
All of the above notwithstanding, the Board notes that the record also contains, as indicated earlier in this decision, multiple diagnoses of PTSD, all rendered by VA mental health specialists.
According to the above report, the veteran's anxiety level appeared to be moderate to severe, but he was in contact with reality and there was no apparent evidence of a perceptual and/or thought disorder.
As clearly shown in the above discussion of the pertinent competent evidence of record, several mental health experts have said that the veteran does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, while other mental health experts, particularly those who have treated the veteran during his multiple psychiatric hospitalizations, have indicated that the veteran indeed suffers from PTSD.
The Board then finds that the evidence as to whether the veteran has PTSD or not is in relative equipoise.
Therefore, resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran, the Board concludes that service connection for PTSD is warranted.
