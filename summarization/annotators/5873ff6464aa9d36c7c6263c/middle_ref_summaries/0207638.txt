Overall, the veteran's report of stressors while serving on the USS CORAL SEA lack any indicia of reliability or credibility.
Based upon the above, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence establishes that the veteran was not engaged in combat, and that his allegations of exposure to combat and non-combat stressors are not credible.
The Board, therefore, finds that the veteran's PTSD is not shown to have its origins in his military service.
As the veteran was not engaged in combat, the evidentiary presumptions contained in 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) are not applicable in this case.
Furthermore, there is no doubt of material fact to be resolved in the veteran's favor.
