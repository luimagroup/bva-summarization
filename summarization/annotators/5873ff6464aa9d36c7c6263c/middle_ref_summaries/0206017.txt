In short, there were psychiatric problems manifested during the veteran's service and afterwards.
The clinical evidence of record was suggestive to the Board that the veteran might currently have PTSD in addition to a personality disorder.
The IME in essence indicated that the veteran's personality disorder contributed to his PTSD in that the personality disorder traits may have made him more vulnerable to the traumatic event.
Although the medical evidence, summarized above, unquestionably establishes veteran had a personality disorder during service and still does, the evidence reflects that he developed PTSD due to his service.
The fact that the veteran may have been predisposed to PTSD because of his personality disorder, as noted by IME, does not preclude a grant of service connection for PTSD based on the facts of this case.
In summary, for the reasons and bases expressed above, the Board concludes that the weight of competent and credible evidence supports a grant of service connection for PTSD.
