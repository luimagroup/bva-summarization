This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a November 2009 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Montgomery, Alabama.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1979 to June 1982.
The examiner noted mental health diagnoses of chronic PTSD with secondary generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder.
Regarding the Veteran's complaints of headaches and fainting spells in service, the examiner stated, "The Veteran reports multiple pain issues including headaches and back pain. These issues could be exacerbated by emotional distress but are not directly related."
This statement requires clarification.
As the December 2016 opinion does not clearly address this issue, an additional medical opinion is warranted to determine whether the Veteran's PTSD is proximately due to or aggravated by her service-connected migraines.
The appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ.
