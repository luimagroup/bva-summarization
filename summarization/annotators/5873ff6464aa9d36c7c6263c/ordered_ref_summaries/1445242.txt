This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2005 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Oakland, California.
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression.
The Veteran served on active duty from May 1967 to August 1968.
In March 2011, a VA physician noted the Veteran's report that he had PTSD based on an attack in the shower in service.
In an August 2014 report, a private physician reviewed pertinent evidence in the Veteran's claims file and opined that the in-service stressor involving the assault in the shower was sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran had PTSD due to that in-service stressor.
While the March 2011 VA physician opined that the stressor involving the assault in the shower was not sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD, that opinion appears to be based on the fact that the Veteran was not physically harmed by the stressor.

Thus, the Veteran should be provided another VA examination to determine whether he has a psychiatric disability that had its onset in or is due to active service.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:
