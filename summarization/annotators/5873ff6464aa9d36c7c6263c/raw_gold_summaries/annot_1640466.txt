#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1966 to July 1968, including combat service in the Republic of Vietnam.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veteran's Appeals (Board) from a June 2011 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Newington, Connecticut.

#Evidential Support#
Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran has experienced symptoms of recurrent distressing dreams of the traumatic event; intense psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event; efforts to avoid thoughts, feelings, or conversations associated with the trauma; efforts to avoid activities, places, or people that arouse recollections of the trauma; feeling of detachment or estrangement from others; difficulty falling or staying asleep; irritability or outbursts of anger; and difficulty concentrating.

#Evidential Support#
The Board finds that the Veteran's reported stressors are consistent with the places, types and circumstances of his service in Vietnam.

#Evidential Support#
A VA therapist, from the VA PTSD Clinical Team, provided a July 2016 statement noting diagnoses of persistent depressive disorder and PTSD related to combat he experienced in Vietnam.

#Reasoning#
The Board finds that the medical evidence of record supports the finding that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms are related to his in-service stressors.

#Reasoning#
Consequently, the elements necessary to establish service connection for his psychiatric disorder have been met.

#Outcome#
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed PTSD and depressive disorder, is granted.
