#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The appellant had active service in the Marine Corps from January 1969 to August 1970, as well as subsequent active service in the Army from July 1971 to August 1979.

#Procedural History#
This case originally came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating actions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Montgomery, Alabama that denied the appellant's claim for service connection for post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Evidential Support#
Despite repeat searches by the Headquarters of the USMC, corroborating evidence relating to the stressors described over and over by the appellant in his hearing testimony and in his written statements has not been uncovered.

#Evidential Support#
In view of the foregoing, the Board concludes that, while a diagnosis of PTSD is established by the medical evidence, a preponderance of the evidence is against this claim on the basis that verification of the alleged stressors has not been satisfied, for the reasons detailed above.

#Reasoning#
After a thorough review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the appellant's claim for service connection for PTSD.

#Reasoning#
Although diagnoses of PTSD are of record, there is no evidence of record corroborating that the alleged inservice stressors actually occurred, and there are no specific details of record indicating that any of the alleged stressors could be verified by competent evidence.

#Reasoning#
After reviewing the record, the Board is satisfied that all relevant facts with respect to this claim have been properly developed and that no further assistance to the appellant is required.

#Outcome#
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
