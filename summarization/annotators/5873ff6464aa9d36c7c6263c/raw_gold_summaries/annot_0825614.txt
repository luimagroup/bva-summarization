#Procedural History#
On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Los Angeles, California

#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran served on active military duty from July 1966 to June 1968.

#Outcome#
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.

#Evidential Support#
VA treatment records from 2005 reflect the veteran's attendance at PTSD groups.

#Evidential Support#
However, the veteran's service personnel records are not currently associated with his claims file, and efforts to obtain them should be made.

#Evidential Support#
Additionally, the current record does not reflect any meaningful effort to corroborate the veteran's claimed stressors.

#Reasoning#
The letter sent to the veteran to inform him of the information and evidence necessary to establish his claim, indicated that his claim was for "post pragmatic syndrome" and "post pramatia syndrome," and there is no indication veteran was ever sent a stressor identification letter.

#Reasoning#
This should be accomplished.
