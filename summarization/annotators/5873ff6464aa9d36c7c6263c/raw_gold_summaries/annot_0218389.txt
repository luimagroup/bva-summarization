#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran had active service from March 1964 to March 1968.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a March 2002 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (PA), denying the veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
Although the veteran was diagnosed with PTSD by history in July 2001, this diagnosis was based entirely on the veteran's subjective reported psychiatric history.

#Evidential Support#
The VA examiner who diagnosed the veteran with PTSD by history made no reference to the diagnostic criteria for PTSD found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (or DSM-IV).

#Evidential Support#
More importantly, however, the VA examiner who evaluated the veteran for PTSD in January 2002 specifically concluded that the veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD found in the DSM-IV either in terms of any identified stressors or in terms of any ongoing psychological symptoms.

#Reasoning#
Given the foregoing, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against a diagnosis of PTSD in this case.

#Reasoning#
The Board also notes that further assistance to the veteran in developing this claim is not warranted, as there is no reasonable possibility that such assistance would aid in substantiating the claim.

#Outcome#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is denied.
