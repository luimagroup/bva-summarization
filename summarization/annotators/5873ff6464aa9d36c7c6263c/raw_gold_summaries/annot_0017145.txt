#Procedural History#
On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Denver, Colorado

#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran had active service from August 1973 to November 1974.

#Evidential Support#
While this matter has been in remand status, the Board has learned of a pending fraud investigation which is being conducted by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

#Evidential Support#
The veteran's claim file is believed to contain information relevant to this investigation and OIG has requested that the claims file be transferred to OIG in connection with a hearing scheduled for July 3, 2000, in the jurisdiction of the RO.

#Reasoning#
Consequently, the Board finds that it would not be appropriate for the Board to proceed further in this matter until the investigation has been concluded and the results of the investigation have been associated with the claims folder.
