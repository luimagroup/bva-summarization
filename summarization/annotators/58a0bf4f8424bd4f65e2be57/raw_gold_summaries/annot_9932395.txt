#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran served on active duty from July 1968 to July 1970.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following an October 1996 decision of the Buffalo, New York, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) which denied a claim of service connection for PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
Evidence obtained in connection with the veteran's attempt to reopen his claim includes VA treatment records that include a diagnosis of PTSD as a result of the veteran's experiences in the Republic of Vietnam, information that was not previously available in July 1994.

#Evidential Support#
As noted above, the evidence of record includes a diagnosis of PTSD by medical personnel and statements from the veteran to the effect that he was exposed to severe stressors in service, including having a friend killed.

#Evidential Support#
Consequently, the yearbook and service records provide support for the veteran's recitation of events: having a friend with whom he served killed in action.

#Reasoning#
Given that the October 1997 evaluation report showing PTSD reflected extensive examination and testing, given that examiners who diagnose PTSD must find that the traumatic event is being re-experienced in some way, and because the examiners in this case appear to rely on the existence of the claimed in-service event in reaching the diagnosis of PTSD, the Board finds that the evidence is in relative equipoise on this point.

#Outcome#
With application of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine, a grant of service connection is warranted.
