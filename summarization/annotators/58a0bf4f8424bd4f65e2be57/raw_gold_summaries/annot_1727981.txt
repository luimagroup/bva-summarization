#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1979 to June 1982.

#Service History#
In addition, she had service in the National Guard from September 1984 to September 1985.

#Outcome#
The appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ.

#Evidential Support#
The Veteran was afforded an additional VA psychiatric evaluation in December 2016.

#Evidential Support#
This, however, does not respond to the question as to whether these headaches and fainting spells were manifestations of a current psychiatric disorder.

#Evidential Support#
In addition, the Veteran, through her representative, has asserted that her PTSD and depression are caused or aggravated by her service connected migraines. See June 2017 Appellate Brief.

#Reasoning#
As the December 2016 opinion does not clearly address this issue, an additional medical opinion is warranted to determine whether the Veteran's PTSD is proximately due to or aggravated by her service-connected migraines.

#Reasoning#
Obtain a VA addendum opinion by the same December 2016 examiner, (or another appropriate examiner if unavailable), to provide opinions as to whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent or better probability) that the Veteran's PTSD was caused by OR aggravated (i.e., permanently worsened beyond the natural progress of the disorder) by her service-connected migraine headaches.
