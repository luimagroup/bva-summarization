#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty from August 1969 to March 1972 and from June 1979 to December 1991.

#Service History#
He also served on active duty from March 1972 to June 1979, except for an unspecified 20 months of inactive service during that period.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2001 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO) in Montgomery, Alabama.

#Outcome#
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.

#Evidential Support#
The Veteran's claim has been denied for a failure to supply VA with sufficiently detailed information regarding his alleged in-service stressors.

#Evidential Support#
However, the record contains a much more detailed statement from the Veteran that does not appear to have been considered.

#Reasoning#
An additional attempt to verify the Veteran's alleged in-service stressors must be made.

#Reasoning#
The AMC should contact the U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) (formerly the U.S. Armed Services Center for Unit Records Research (CURR)) to verify the claimed stressor, i.e., whether there was an incident involving exploding ammunition in June 1991 at Camp Doha, Kuwait that resulted in the death of three soldiers, and if so, whether the Veteran was present at this time.
