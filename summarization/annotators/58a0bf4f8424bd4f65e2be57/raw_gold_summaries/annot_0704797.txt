#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The appellant had active air service from June 1968 to March 1969, with time lost by reason of being absent without leave (AWOL) from duty in December 1968 and January 1969.

#Procedural History#
This appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) arises from rating decisions in April 1996 and May 1997 by the Waco, Texas, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

#Evidential Support#
With regard to the first claimed in-service stressor, the appellant has not submitted any supporting evidence, such as an affidavit by an eyewitness or by some other person claiming to have personal knowledge of the appellant's alleged abuse in December 1968 by the military prison guards, nor has he or his representative identified any existing evidence which would tend to support or corroborate the appellant's statements concerning such alleged abuse.

#Evidential Support#
In March 2006, the JSRRC reported to VA that after extensive research, the jeep accident as described by the appellant could not be documented.

#Evidential Support#
No supporting evidence whatsoever having been presented or identified, there is no credible evidence that the appellant's second claimed in- service stressor occurred.

#Reasoning#
There is no such credible supporting evidence in this case of the occurrence of either of the appellant's two claimed in-service stressors.

#Reasoning#
Because service connection is denied for PTSD, any question as to the appropriate disability rating or effective date is moot, and there can be no failure to notify prejudice to the veteran.

#Outcome#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is denied.
