#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran served on active duty from October 1968 to October 1970.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 1990 confirmed rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) San Juan, Puerto Rico, Regional Office (RO), which denied a claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
The Board notes that the veteran is a combat veteran, and that he has claimed combat stressors that are credible, and consistent with the circumstances, conditions and hardships of his service.

#Evidential Support#
In addition to the above, the vast majority of the multiple VA psychiatric admissions of the veteran throughout the years have included a diagnosis of PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
As noted above, the record shows that the veteran is a combat veteran, who has reported stressful inservice experiences, and he has had multiple hospitalizations in which he has reported symptoms arising from those inservice experiences.

#Reasoning#
As clearly shown in the above discussion of the pertinent competent evidence of record, several mental health experts have said that the veteran does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, while other mental health experts, particularly those who have treated the veteran during his multiple psychiatric hospitalizations, have indicated that the veteran indeed suffers from PTSD.

#Outcome#
Therefore, resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran, the Board concludes that service connection for PTSD is warranted.
