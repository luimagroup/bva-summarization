Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from October 1968 to May 1970.
This matter is on appeal from an April 2005 decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.
As an initial matter, although the Veteran stated that the mortar attack in June or July 1969, it appears that the JSRRC only reviewed records from July 1969.
In order to prevent prejudice to the Veteran, the relevant records from June 1969 should be reviewed as well.
Nevertheless, the Board concludes that a new VA examination is warranted, given the recent change to 38 C.F.R. ï¿½ 3.304 and the receipt of evidence since February 2005.
The Veteran has also been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, which has never been considered by the RO, despite the Veteran's statements that he has been experiencing symptoms since active duty.
Therefore, given the Veteran's statements of continuous psychiatric symptoms since active duty, a VA opinion is also necessary to consider this issue as well.
Finally, the Board notes that the Veteran is in receipt of disability benefits from the Social Security Administration (SSA) since 1999, but there is no indication that there has been an attempt to acquire the treatment records the SSA may possess.
