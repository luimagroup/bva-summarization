Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1966 to July 1968, including combat service in the Republic of Vietnam.
This matter comes before the Board of Veteran's Appeals (Board) from a June 2011 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Newington, Connecticut.
The Board finds that the Veteran's reported stressors are consistent with the places, types and circumstances of his service in Vietnam.
A VA therapist, from the VA PTSD Clinical Team, provided a July 2016 statement noting diagnoses of persistent depressive disorder and PTSD related to combat he experienced in Vietnam.
She also indicated that the Veteran has consistently reported that symptoms associated with PTSD and depressive disorder began during his service and have caused him significant dysfunction throughout his life.
The Board finds that the medical evidence of record supports the finding that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms are related to his in-service stressors.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed PTSD and depressive disorder, is granted.
