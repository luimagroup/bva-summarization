Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1957 to March 1961.
The current appeal stems from a November 1992 decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in Fort Harrison, Montana (the RO) which denied the veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, based on lack of new and material evidence.
With respect to element (1), a current medical diagnosis of PTSD, although there are other psychiatric diagnoses of record, the most common recent diagnosis, in addition to personality disorder, appears to be PTSD.
However, the service administrative records serve to support the occurrence of the shooting incident and related events during service which the veteran claims caused his PTSD.
With regard to element (3), nexus, the IME and a number of other psychiatric examiners have associated the diagnosis of PTSD to the accidental discharge of a weapon by the veteran in service.
The Board bases its conclusion on the medical evidence of record, in particular the IME opinion, which is obviously grounded in a thorough review of the veteran's complex medical history.
Although the medical evidence, summarized above, unquestionably establishes veteran had a personality disorder during service and still does, the evidence reflects that he developed PTSD due to his service.
The fact that the veteran may have been predisposed to PTSD because of his personality disorder, as noted by IME, does not preclude a grant of service connection for PTSD based on the facts of this case.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.
