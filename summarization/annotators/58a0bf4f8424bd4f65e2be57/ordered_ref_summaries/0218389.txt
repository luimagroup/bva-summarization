This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a March 2002 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (PA), denying the veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD.
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active service from March 1964 to March 1968.
Although the veteran was diagnosed with PTSD by history in July 2001, this diagnosis was based entirely on the veteran's subjective reported psychiatric history.
More importantly, however, the VA examiner who evaluated the veteran for PTSD in January 2002 specifically concluded that the veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD found in the DSM-IV either in terms of any identified stressors or in terms of any ongoing psychological symptoms.
The cumulative effect of this medical evidence (i.e., the various diagnoses of the veteran's psychiatric problems issued by VA examiners who treated the veteran's psychological problems since his separation from service) demonstrates, at best, that the veteran suffers from a psychological condition other than PTSD.
Given the foregoing, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against a diagnosis of PTSD in this case.
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is denied.
