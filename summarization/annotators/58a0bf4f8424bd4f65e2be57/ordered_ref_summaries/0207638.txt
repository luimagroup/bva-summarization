This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 1996 rating decision by the Huntington, West Virginia Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) which denied service connection for PTSD.
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active service from December 1964 to December 1968.
The veteran's service medical records do not reflect his report of exposure to combat or non-combat stressors.
Overall, the veteran's report of stressors while serving on the USS CORAL SEA lack any indicia of reliability or credibility.
Based upon the above, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence establishes that the veteran was not engaged in combat, and that his allegations of exposure to combat and non-combat stressors are not credible.
The Board, therefore, finds that the veteran's PTSD is not shown to have its origins in his military service.
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
