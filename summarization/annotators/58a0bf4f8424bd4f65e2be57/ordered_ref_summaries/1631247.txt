This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2011 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Roanoke, Virginia.
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from February 1973 to June 1981.
On remand the Veteran should be afforded an additional opportunity to submit stressor information in support of his claim and the RO should attempt to verify the Veteran's asserted in-service stressors.
Although the Veteran was afforded a VA mental disorders examination (other than PTSD) in June 2014, the examination was in connection with his claim for service connection for residuals of traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, despite VA treatment records indicating that the Veteran is diagnosed with multiple psychiatric diagnoses, including PTSD, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran as having a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury only.
Under these circumstances, the Board finds that a VA examination and a medical opinion are needed to determine the nature and etiology of any current psychiatric disorder that may be present, to include PTSD.
The appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).
