The appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).
On remand the Veteran should be afforded an additional opportunity to submit stressor information in support of his claim and the RO should attempt to verify the Veteran's asserted in-service stressors.
Although the Veteran was afforded a VA mental disorders examination (other than PTSD) in June 2014, the examination was in connection with his claim for service connection for residuals of traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, despite VA treatment records indicating that the Veteran is diagnosed with multiple psychiatric diagnoses, including PTSD, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran as having a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury only.
