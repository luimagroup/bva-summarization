This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2001 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO) in Montgomery, Alabama.
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.
The Veteran's claim has been denied for a failure to supply VA with sufficiently detailed information regarding his alleged in-service stressors.
However, the record contains a much more detailed statement from the Veteran that does not appear to have been considered.
An additional attempt to verify the Veteran's alleged in-service stressors must be made.
