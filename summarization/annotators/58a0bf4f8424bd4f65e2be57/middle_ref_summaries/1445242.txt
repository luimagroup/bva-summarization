While the March 2011 VA physician opined that the stressor involving the assault in the shower was not sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD, that opinion appears to be based on the fact that the Veteran was not physically harmed by the stressor.
The physician also did not discuss whether seeing the physical assaults on other recruits was a sufficient stressor.
While the August 2014 private physician opined that the stressor involving the assault in the shower was sufficient and the Veteran has PTSD due to that stressor, that opinion is based on the finding that the Veteran was hypersensitive to stressors.
Without having examined the Veteran, the Board observes that that finding and the resulting opinion are of limited probative value.
Thus, the Veteran should be provided another VA examination to determine whether he has a psychiatric disability that had its onset in or is due to active service.
