The veteran's service medical records do not reflect his report of exposure to combat or non-combat stressors.
Overall, the veteran's report of stressors while serving on the USS CORAL SEA lack any indicia of reliability or credibility.
Based upon the above, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence establishes that the veteran was not engaged in combat, and that his allegations of exposure to combat and non-combat stressors are not credible.
The Board, therefore, finds that the veteran's PTSD is not shown to have its origins in his military service.
