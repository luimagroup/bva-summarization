The appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ.
The Veteran was afforded an additional VA psychiatric evaluation in December 2016.
This, however, does not respond to the question as to whether these headaches and fainting spells were manifestations of a current psychiatric disorder.
In addition, the Veteran, through her representative, has asserted that her PTSD and depression are caused or aggravated by her service connected migraines. See June 2017 Appellate Brief.
As the December 2016 opinion does not clearly address this issue, an additional medical opinion is warranted to determine whether the Veteran's PTSD is proximately due to or aggravated by her service-connected migraines.
