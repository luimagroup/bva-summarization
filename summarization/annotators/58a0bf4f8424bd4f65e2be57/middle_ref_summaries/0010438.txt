The Board notes that the veteran is a combat veteran, and that he has claimed combat stressors that are credible, and consistent with the circumstances, conditions and hardships of his service.
In addition to the above, the vast majority of the multiple VA psychiatric admissions of the veteran throughout the years have included a diagnosis of PTSD.
As noted above, the record shows that the veteran is a combat veteran, who has reported stressful inservice experiences, and he has had multiple hospitalizations in which he has reported symptoms arising from those inservice experiences.
As clearly shown in the above discussion of the pertinent competent evidence of record, several mental health experts have said that the veteran does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, while other mental health experts, particularly those who have treated the veteran during his multiple psychiatric hospitalizations, have indicated that the veteran indeed suffers from PTSD.
