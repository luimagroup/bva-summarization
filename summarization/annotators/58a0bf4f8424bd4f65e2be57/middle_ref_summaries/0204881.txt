The appellant alleges that he engaged in combat with the enemy during service while delivering and collecting mail at front line landing bases.
Since the Board finds that the appellant did not engage in combat with the enemy, there must be credible supporting evidence of record that the alleged stressors actually occurred in order to warrant service connection.
In this case, other than the appellant's own statements concerning the alleged stressors described in the record, there is no competent evidence regarding the claimed inservice stressors in the claims file.
Therefore, the Board concludes that the appellant's assertions alone are of insufficient probative value to meet the second element required to establish service connection for PTSD, credible supporting evidence that the claimed in- service stressors actually occurred.
In view of the foregoing, the Board concludes that, while a diagnosis of PTSD is established by the medical evidence, a preponderance of the evidence is against this claim on the basis that verification of the alleged stressors has not been satisfied, for the reasons detailed above.
