The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.
The veteran's treatment records since that time to the present date should also be obtained, as they may be relevant to the adjudication of this claim.
However, the veteran's service personnel records are not currently associated with his claims file, and efforts to obtain them should be made.
Additionally, the current record does not reflect any meaningful effort to corroborate the veteran's claimed stressors.
