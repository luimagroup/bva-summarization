While this matter has been in remand status, the Board has learned of a pending fraud investigation which is being conducted by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
The Board is not aware of the documents contained within the claims file which are relevant to the pending investigation.
Consequently, the Board finds that it would not be appropriate for the Board to proceed further in this matter until the investigation has been concluded and the results of the investigation have been associated with the claims folder.
