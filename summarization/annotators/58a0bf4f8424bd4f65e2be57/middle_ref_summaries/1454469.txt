The appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).
As noted in the previous remand, the Board referred to the Joint Motion which noted that the Secretary has acknowledged that there is "limited or suggestive evidence of an association between hypertension and exposure to herbicides."
Given the acknowledgement by the Secretary that there is some evidence of an association, this opinion is inadequate as based on an inaccurate premise.
In addition, in a November 2014 appellate brief, the Veteran's representative argued that the Veteran's hypertension may be aggravated by his service-connected PTSD.
As no opinion has been obtained concerning his new theory of entitlement, the Board finds an additional opinion is necessary as to whether the Veteran's hypertension is caused or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD.
Finally, it is unclear as to whether the Veteran's service treatment records are complete.
