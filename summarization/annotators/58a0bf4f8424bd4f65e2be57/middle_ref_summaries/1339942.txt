First, the Board notes that the Veteran underwent an August 2011 VA psychiatric examination in which the examiner found in-service stressors of a fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, during the Veteran's service in Vietnam.
The examiner concluded that although the Veteran described symptoms of PTSD, he did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, or for any psychiatric disorder.
In light of the clinical findings of the August 2011 VA examination and the absence of favorable competent medical evidence of record showing a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.
For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, and the claim must be denied.
