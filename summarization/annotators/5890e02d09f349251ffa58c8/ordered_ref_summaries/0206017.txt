The current appeal stems from a November 1992 decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in Fort Harrison, Montana (the RO) which denied the veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, based on lack of new and material evidence.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1957 to March 1961.
According to a psychiatric consultation in July 1960, "(the veteran) accidentally shot a fellow soldier while on guard post . . . , approximately a year ago.
In essence, the IME indicated that the veteran had PTSD which was related to the shooting incident during service.
The IME in essence indicated that the veteran's personality disorder contributed to his PTSD in that the personality disorder traits may have made him more vulnerable to the traumatic event.
However, the service administrative records serve to support the occurrence of the shooting incident and related events during service which the veteran claims caused his PTSD.
The veteran has submitted competent evidence of a current diagnosis of PTSD; credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and medical evidence of a causal nexus between current symptomatology and the specific claimed in-service stressor.
Although the medical evidence, summarized above, unquestionably establishes veteran had a personality disorder during service and still does, the evidence reflects that he developed PTSD due to his service.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.
