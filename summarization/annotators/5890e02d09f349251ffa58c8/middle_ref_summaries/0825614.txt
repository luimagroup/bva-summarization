VA treatment records from 2005 reflect the veteran's attendance at PTSD groups.
The veteran's treatment records since that time to the present date should also be obtained, as they may be relevant to the adjudication of this claim.
The veteran's DD-214 discharge report indicates that the veteran served a portion of his active duty in Vietnam where he served as a field artillery crewman.
His VA psychologist reports that the veteran served in Vietnam as a radioman in the 1st Cavalry Division.
However, the veteran's service personnel records are not currently associated with his claims file, and efforts to obtain them should be made.
Additionally, the current record does not reflect any meaningful effort to corroborate the veteran's claimed stressors.
