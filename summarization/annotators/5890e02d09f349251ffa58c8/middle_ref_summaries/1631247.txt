The Board finds that remand is required to obtain a VA examination and afford the Veteran an additional opportunity to submit stressor details.
During his Board hearing, the Veteran testified that in approximately October or November 1975 while stationed in Japan, his master gunnery sergeant, whom he had befriended, was killed in a motorcycle accident.
On remand the Veteran should be afforded an additional opportunity to submit stressor information in support of his claim and the RO should attempt to verify the Veteran's asserted in-service stressors.
In addition, the Board notes that the Veteran has not been provided a VA examination in connection with his claim for PTSD.
Furthermore, despite VA treatment records indicating that the Veteran is diagnosed with multiple psychiatric diagnoses, including PTSD, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran as having a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury only.
Under these circumstances, the Board finds that a VA examination and a medical opinion are needed to determine the nature and etiology of any current psychiatric disorder that may be present, to include PTSD.
