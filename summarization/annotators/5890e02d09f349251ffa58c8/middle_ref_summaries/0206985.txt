In this regard, the veteran has reported that he was severely beaten during boot camp, that he feared being beaten to death because of rumors that this had happened to a prior recruit, and that he was afraid of being killed because of the shooting of live ammunition during "motivation" training.
The Board notes that the veteran's service medical records are entirely negative for documentation of his claimed stressors.
Given the limited information provided by the veteran and the RO's attempts to obtain service department information, the Board finds that sufficient efforts have been made to verify his stressors and that, even though no stressors were verified, there is no reasonable basis for further stressor development.
Overall, based upon a review of the entire claims file, the Board finds that the evidence of record shows that the veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD.
However, the evidence of record does not in any way reflect participation in combat with the enemy, and there is no evidence showing that the veteran's current diagnosis of PTSD is based upon a verified stressor from service.
As such, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
