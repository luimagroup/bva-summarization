The Veteran was afforded an additional VA psychiatric evaluation in December 2016.
The examiner noted mental health diagnoses of chronic PTSD with secondary generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder.
Regarding the Veteran's complaints of headaches and fainting spells in service, the examiner stated, "The Veteran reports multiple pain issues including headaches and back pain. These issues could be exacerbated by emotional distress but are not directly related."
This, however, does not respond to the question as to whether these headaches and fainting spells were manifestations of a current psychiatric disorder.
This statement requires clarification.
As the December 2016 opinion does not clearly address this issue, an additional medical opinion is warranted to determine whether the Veteran's PTSD is proximately due to or aggravated by her service-connected migraines.
