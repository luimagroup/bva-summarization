Specifically, VA received a statement from the Veteran in April 2008 providing VA with the location and nature of his alleged in-service stressors
The Veteran also narrowed down the time of the incident to June 1991.
The August 2008 JSRRC report makes no mention of the Veteran's April 2008 statement.
The Veteran's claim has been denied for a failure to supply VA with sufficiently detailed information regarding his alleged in-service stressors.
However, the record contains a much more detailed statement from the Veteran that does not appear to have been considered.
An additional attempt to verify the Veteran's alleged in-service stressors must be made.
