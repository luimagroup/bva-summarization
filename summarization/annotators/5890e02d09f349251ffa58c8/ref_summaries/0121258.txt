Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active military service from November 1944 to November 1946.
This matter came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a July 1991 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Although the RO had previously attempted to verify the veteran's alleged stressors through the USASCRUR, its request to the USASCRUR did not adequately identify the veteran's claimed stressors.
A completed NA Form 13075 was apparently received by the RO on April 3, 1996, but for reasons unclear to the Board, was not associated with the claims folder until some time after the Board's November 1996 decision.
In addition, the RO failed to comply with the Board's directive to attempt to verify the veteran's claimed in-service stressors through USASCRUR.
It essentially eliminates the requirement that a claimant submit evidence of a well-grounded claim, and provides that VA will assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate a claim but is not required to provide assistance to a claimant if there is no reasonable possibility that such assistance would aid in substantiating the claim.
In light of these circumstances, this case is REMANDED to the RO for the following:
The RO should request that the veteran submit the names, addresses and approximate dates of treatment or evaluation for all VA and non-VA medical care providers who have treated or evaluated him since his service separation for any psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.
Upon completion of the above development, the veteran should be afforded a VA examination by a psychiatrist to determine if he has PTSD which is etiologically related to his military service.
