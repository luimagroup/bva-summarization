Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The appellant had active service in the Marine Corps from January 1969 to August 1970, as well as subsequent active service in the Army from July 1971 to August 1979.
The RO has now returned the case to the Board for appellate review.
In this case, for the following reasons, the Board finds that the appellant did not engage in combat with the enemy.
First, his military occupational specialty of postal clerk while in Vietnam does not indicate combat service.
In this case, other than the appellant's own statements concerning the alleged stressors described in the record, there is no competent evidence regarding the claimed inservice stressors in the claims file.
It appears that this may be due to a lack of specific details about those stressors from the appellant that would provide a tangible avenue for the USMC to research.
Therefore, the Board concludes that the appellant's assertions alone are of insufficient probative value to meet the second element required to establish service connection for PTSD, credible supporting evidence that the claimed in- service stressors actually occurred.
Although diagnoses of PTSD are of record, there is no evidence of record corroborating that the alleged inservice stressors actually occurred, and there are no specific details of record indicating that any of the alleged stressors could be verified by competent evidence.
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
