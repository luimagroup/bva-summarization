Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression.
The Veteran served on active duty from May 1967 to August 1968.
This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2005 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Oakland, California.
At a hearing before a DRO in August 2006, the Veteran testified that while he was in the shower another recruit turned off the cold water, scalding him, and he became very fearful from that point on.
The physician also did not discuss whether seeing the physical assaults on other recruits was a sufficient stressor.
While the August 2014 private physician opined that the stressor involving the assault in the shower was sufficient and the Veteran has PTSD due to that stressor, that opinion is based on the finding that the Veteran was hypersensitive to stressors.
Thus, the Veteran should be provided another VA examination to determine whether he has a psychiatric disability that had its onset in or is due to active service.
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:
The examiner should provide a full multi-axial diagnosis pursuant to DSM-IV and specifically state whether each criterion for a diagnosis of PTSD is met, to include discussion of the sufficiency of the stressors involving the assault in the shower and seeing the physical assaults of other recruits.
The examiner should address the June 1968 service medical record showing that the Veteran was treated for angioneurotic edema and recurrent urticaria and prescribed Atarax for nervous problems, the August 2005 VA examiner's opinion that the Veteran's PTSD with secondary depression was related to a traumatic event during active duty, the March 2007 Vet Center opinion that the Veteran's overall military experience may have led to depression, the March 2011 VA physician's conclusion that the Veteran did not meet criterion A for PTSD, and the August 2014 private physician's opinion that the stressor involving the assault in the shower was sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD and the Veteran has PTSD due to that stressor.
