Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from October 1968 to October 1970.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 1990 confirmed rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) San Juan, Puerto Rico, Regional Office (RO), which denied a claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
The Board notes that the veteran is a combat veteran, and that he has claimed combat stressors that are credible, and consistent with the circumstances, conditions and hardships of his service.
In August 1992, the veteran was again examined by VA mental health specialists, and, while a depressive disorder and alcohol dependence, in remission, were again diagnosed, it was again noted that the veteran complained of recalling inservice stressful events, such as witnessing a fellow soldier who fell from a helicopter, and killing four Vietnamese with a grenade.
In addition to the above, the vast majority of the multiple VA psychiatric admissions of the veteran throughout the years have included a diagnosis of PTSD.
As clearly shown in the above discussion of the pertinent competent evidence of record, several mental health experts have said that the veteran does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, while other mental health experts, particularly those who have treated the veteran during his multiple psychiatric hospitalizations, have indicated that the veteran indeed suffers from PTSD.
The Board then finds that the evidence as to whether the veteran has PTSD or not is in relative equipoise.
Therefore, resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran, the Board concludes that service connection for PTSD is warranted.
Service connection for PTSD is granted.
