On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1966 to July 1968, including combat service in the Republic of Vietnam.
Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran has experienced symptoms of recurrent distressing dreams of the traumatic event; intense psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event; efforts to avoid thoughts, feelings, or conversations associated with the trauma; efforts to avoid activities, places, or people that arouse recollections of the trauma; feeling of detachment or estrangement from others; difficulty falling or staying asleep; irritability or outbursts of anger; and difficulty concentrating.
The Board finds that the Veteran's reported stressors are consistent with the places, types and circumstances of his service in Vietnam.
A VA therapist, from the VA PTSD Clinical Team, provided a July 2016 statement noting diagnoses of persistent depressive disorder and PTSD related to combat he experienced in Vietnam.
She also indicated that the Veteran has consistently reported that symptoms associated with PTSD and depressive disorder began during his service and have caused him significant dysfunction throughout his life.
The Board finds that the medical evidence of record supports the finding that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms are related to his in-service stressors.
Consequently, the elements necessary to establish service connection for his psychiatric disorder have been met.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed PTSD and depressive disorder, is granted.
