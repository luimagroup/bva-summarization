Entitlement to service connection for a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from July 1968 to July 1970.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following an October 1996 decision of the Buffalo, New York, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) which denied a claim of service connection for PTSD.
The evidence obtained in connection with the veteran's attempt to reopen his claim, since the last final denial, includes VA treatment records and a VA examination report that include a diagnosis of PTSD as a result of his alleged experiences in the Republic of Vietnam.
Accordingly, the Board concludes that the veteran has submitted new and material evidence to reopen his claim of service connection for PTSD.
Initially, the Board notes that, the veteran, through both written statements to the RO (from himself and his wife) and statements at VA examinations, reported that his PTSD was brought about by, among other things, having a friend of his (from either California or Texas) killed while on guard duty in January 1969, or killed in January 1969 when his base was overrun during the Tet Offensive, or killed after he had been transferred to another unit.
Available treatment records show that the veteran was diagnosed with PTSD in August and October 1995.
As noted above, the evidence of record includes a diagnosis of PTSD by medical personnel and statements from the veteran to the effect that he was exposed to severe stressors in service, including having a friend killed.
Consequently, the yearbook and service records provide support for the veteran's recitation of events: having a friend with whom he served killed in action.
Service connection for PTSD is granted.
