#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran had active service from December 1964 to December 1968.

#Procedural History#
This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 1996 rating decision by the Huntington, West Virginia Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) which denied service connection for PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
The veteran was not engaged in combat in service, and his allegations of exposure to combat and non-combat stressors are not credible.

#Evidential Support#
The deck logs of the USS CORAL SEA contradict his report of combat exposure on mainland Vietnam in August 1966 as they clearly show no Vietnam service during this time period.

#Evidential Support#
The veteran's January 1997 testimony completely contradicts his report to VA examiners of witnessing a soldier being killed or mutilated by rotating propellers.

#Reasoning#
Overall, the veteran's report of stressors while serving on the USS CORAL SEA lack any indicia of reliability or credibility.

#Reasoning#
Based upon the above, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence establishes that the veteran was not engaged in combat, and that his allegations of exposure to combat and non-combat stressors are not credible.

#Reasoning#
The Board, therefore, finds that the veteran's PTSD is not shown to have its origins in his military service.

#Outcome#
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
