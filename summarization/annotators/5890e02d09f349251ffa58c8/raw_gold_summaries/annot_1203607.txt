#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty from October 1968 to May 1970.

#Procedural History#
This matter is on appeal from an April 2005 decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

#Evidential Support#
As an initial matter, although the Veteran stated that the mortar attack in June or July 1969, it appears that the JSRRC only reviewed records from July 1969.

#Evidential Support#
Specifically, while the VA examiner at that time did not diagnose PTSD, the Veteran did not articulate his stressors until September 2006.

#Evidential Support#
Finally, the Board notes that the Veteran is in receipt of disability benefits from the Social Security Administration (SSA) since 1999, but there is no indication that there has been an attempt to acquire the treatment records the SSA may possess.

#Outcome#
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:

#Reasoning#
Obtain the Veteran's SSA records, including the medical evidence used to determine disability eligibility.

#Reasoning#
The VA examiner should determine whether any of the stressors claimed by the Veteran are related to his fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.

#Reasoning#
Thereafter, the VA examiner should confirm whether any of the claimed stressors are adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and whether the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor(s).
