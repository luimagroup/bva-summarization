#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty from February 1967 to September 1969.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) from an August 2011 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO) in Nashville, Tennessee.

#Evidential Support#
First, the Board notes that the Veteran underwent an August 2011 VA psychiatric examination in which the examiner found in-service stressors of a fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, during the Veteran's service in Vietnam.

#Reasoning#
There is no evidence that a chronic psychiatric disorder was treated or diagnosed during service or after service.

#Evidential Support#
Indeed, in the August 2011 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he did not seek or receive psychiatric treatment before, during, or after service.

#Evidential Support#
Nonetheless, following a thorough examination of the Veteran, the examiner found that the Veteran demonstrated stable and adequate psychosocial functioning, and reported good relationships with family and friends.

#Reasoning#
The examiner concluded that although the Veteran described symptoms of PTSD, he did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, or for any psychiatric disorder.

#Reasoning#
In light of the clinical findings of the August 2011 VA examination and the absence of favorable competent medical evidence of record showing a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.

#Outcome#
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.
