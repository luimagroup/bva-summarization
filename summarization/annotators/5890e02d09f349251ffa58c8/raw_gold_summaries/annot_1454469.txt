#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as due to in-service herbicide exposure and as secondary to service-connected diabetes mellitus and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty from June 1967 to June 1969.

#Procedural History#
This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2008 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Louis, Missouri.

#Evidential Support#
As noted in the previous remand, the Board referred to the Joint Motion which noted that the Secretary has acknowledged that there is "limited or suggestive evidence of an association between hypertension and exposure to herbicides."

#Evidential Support#
The examiner stated that "First of all there is no correlation between agent orange and hypertension."

#Reasoning#
Given the acknowledgement by the Secretary that there is some evidence of an association, this opinion is inadequate as based on an inaccurate premise.

#Evidential Support#
In addition, in a November 2014 appellate brief, the Veteran's representative argued that the Veteran's hypertension may be aggravated by his service-connected PTSD.

#Reasoning#
As no opinion has been obtained concerning his new theory of entitlement, the Board finds an additional opinion is necessary as to whether the Veteran's hypertension is caused or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD.

#Reasoning#
Finally, it is unclear as to whether the Veteran's service treatment records are complete.

#Outcome#
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:
