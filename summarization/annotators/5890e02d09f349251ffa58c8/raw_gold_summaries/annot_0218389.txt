#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran had active service from March 1964 to March 1968.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a March 2002 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (PA), denying the veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
As noted above, the veteran's service medical records indicate treatment for a single incident of transient, non-disabling situational anxiety reaction while in service.

#Evidential Support#
There is no evidence of any psychiatric diagnosis at the date of the veteran's discharge or within 1 year of the veteran's discharge.

#Evidential Support#
Further, there is no evidence of a probative PTSD diagnosis following the veteran's discharge that might support the veteran's claim.

#Reasoning#
The cumulative effect of this medical evidence (i.e., the various diagnoses of the veteran's psychiatric problems issued by VA examiners who treated the veteran's psychological problems since his separation from service) demonstrates, at best, that the veteran suffers from a psychological condition other than PTSD.

#Reasoning#
Given the foregoing, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against a diagnosis of PTSD in this case.

#Reasoning#
Therefore, the Board concludes that PTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by service.

#Outcome#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is denied.
