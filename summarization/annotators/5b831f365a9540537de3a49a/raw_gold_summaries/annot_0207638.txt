#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran had active service from December 1964 to December 1968.

#Procedural History#
This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 1996 rating decision by the Huntington, West Virginia Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) which denied service connection for PTSD.

#Procedural History#
In November 1999, the Board remanded the claim to the RO for additional development.

#Evidential Support#
The veteran's service medical records do not reflect his report of exposure to combat or non-combat stressors.

#Evidential Support#
There is no report that an individual named Purcell was unavailable for duty due to injury or death.

#Reasoning#
The Board, therefore, finds that the veteran's PTSD is not shown to have its origins in his military service.

#Reasoning#
The claim for service connection for PTSD, therefore, must be denied.

#Outcome#
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
