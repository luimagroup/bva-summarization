#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran served on active military duty from July 1966 to June 1968.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2005 rating decision.

#Evidential Support#
However, the veteran's service personnel records are not currently associated with his claims file,

#Reasoning#
efforts to obtain them should be made.

#Evidential Support#
The letter sent to the veteran to inform him of the information and evidence necessary to establish his claim, indicated that his claim was for "post pragmatic syndrome" and "post pramatia syndrome," and there is no indication veteran was ever sent a stressor identification letter.

#Reasoning#
This should be accomplished.

#Outcome#
the case is REMANDED
