#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1966 to July 1968, including combat service in the Republic of Vietnam.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veteran's Appeals (Board) from a June 2011 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Newington, Connecticut. The jurisdiction has since been transferred to the RO in Detroit, Michigan.

#Evidential Support#
The July 1968 separation examination report indicates that the Veteran reported having depression or excessive worry. The record shows current diagnoses of depressive disorder and PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
A VA therapist, from the VA PTSD Clinical Team, provided a July 2016 statement noting diagnoses of persistent depressive disorder and PTSD related to combat he experienced in Vietnam.

#Evidential Support#
She also indicated that the Veteran has consistently reported that symptoms associated with PTSD and depressive disorder began during his service and have caused him significant dysfunction throughout his life.

#Reasoning#
The Board finds that the medical evidence of record supports the finding that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms are related to his in-service stressors. Consequently, the elements necessary to establish service connection for his psychiatric disorder have been met.

#Outcome#
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed PTSD and depressive disorder, is granted.
