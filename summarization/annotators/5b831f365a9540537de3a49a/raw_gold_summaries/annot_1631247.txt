#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from February 1973 to June 1981.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2011 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Roanoke, Virginia. Jurisdiction was subsequently transferred to the RO in Louisville, Kentucky.

#Evidential Support#
On remand the Veteran should be afforded an additional opportunity to submit stressor information in support of his claim and the RO should attempt to verify the Veteran's asserted in-service stressors.

#Evidential Support#
In addition, the Board notes that the Veteran has not been provided a VA examination in connection with his claim for PTSD.

#Reasoning#
Under these circumstances, the Board finds that a VA examination and a medical opinion are needed to determine the nature and etiology of any current psychiatric disorder that may be present, to include PTSD.

#Outcome#
the case is REMANDED
