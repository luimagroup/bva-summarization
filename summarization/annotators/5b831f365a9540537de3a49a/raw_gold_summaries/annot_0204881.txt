#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The appellant had active service in the Marine Corps from January 1969 to August 1970, as well as subsequent active service in the Army from July 1971 to August 1979.

#Procedural History#
This case originally came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating actions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Montgomery, Alabama that denied the appellant's claim for service connection for post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Procedural History#
Thereafter, in August 2000, the Board remanded the case to the RO for the completion of additional development. The RO has now returned the case to the Board for appellate review.

#Evidential Support#
First, his military occupational specialty of postal clerk while in Vietnam does not indicate combat service.

#Evidential Support#
There is no support in his military records for his allegation that he was involved in any combat activity.

#Evidential Support#
Second, none of the appellant's awarded medals or decorations showed active combat involvement. Some of his awards do not specifically rule in, or, for that matter, rule out, participation in combat with the enemy.

#Evidential Support#
In this case, other than the appellant's own statements concerning the alleged stressors described in the record, there is no competent evidence regarding the claimed inservice stressors in the claims file.

#Evidential Support#
the Board concludes that the appellant's assertions alone are of insufficient probative value to meet the second element required to establish service connection for PTSD, credible supporting evidence that the claimed in- service stressors actually occurred.

#Reasoning#
the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the appellant's claim for service connection for PTSD. Although diagnoses of PTSD are of record, there is no evidence of record corroborating that the alleged inservice stressors actually occurred, and there are no specific details of record indicating that any of the alleged stressors could be verified by competent evidence.

#Outcome#
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
