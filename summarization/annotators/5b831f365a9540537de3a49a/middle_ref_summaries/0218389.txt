In the summary and conclusion, the VA examiner concluded that the veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of PTSD in either terms of identified stressors or any ongoing symptoms.
The first diagnosis of PTSD was documented in the veteran's VA medical records in May 1982, more than 14 years after he was separated from service. However, subsequent mental health professions were unable to agree on a definitive diagnosis for the veteran's psychological problems.
the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against a diagnosis of PTSD in this case.
