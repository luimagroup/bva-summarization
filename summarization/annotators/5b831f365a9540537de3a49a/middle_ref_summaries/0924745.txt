However, insufficient efforts have been made to verify the Veteran's alleged in-service stressors. As such, this claim is not ready for appellate review.
The August 2008 JSRRC report makes no mention of the Veteran's April 2008 statement. Therefore, it does not appear that this evidence was considered when denying the Veteran's claim.
the record contains a much more detailed statement from the Veteran that does not appear to have been considered.
