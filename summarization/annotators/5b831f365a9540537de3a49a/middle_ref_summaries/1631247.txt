On remand the Veteran should be afforded an additional opportunity to submit stressor information in support of his claim and the RO should attempt to verify the Veteran's asserted in-service stressors.
In addition, the Board notes that the Veteran has not been provided a VA examination in connection with his claim for PTSD.
Under these circumstances, the Board finds that a VA examination and a medical opinion are needed to determine the nature and etiology of any current psychiatric disorder that may be present, to include PTSD.
