Although the RO had previously attempted to verify the veteran's alleged stressors through the USASCRUR, its request to the USASCRUR did not adequately identify the veteran's claimed stressors.
In addition, the RO failed to comply with the Board's directive to attempt to verify the veteran's claimed in-service stressors through USASCRUR.
the Board notes that during the pendency of the veteran's appeal but after the RO's most recent consideration of the veteran's claim, the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000), was signed into law. This liberalizing law is applicable to the veteran's claim.
