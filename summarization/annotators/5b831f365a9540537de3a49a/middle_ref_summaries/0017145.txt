The veteran's claim file is believed to contain information relevant to this investigation and OIG has requested that the claims file be transferred to OIG in connection with a hearing scheduled for July 3, 2000, in the jurisdiction of the RO. The Board is not aware of the documents contained within the claims file which are relevant to the pending investigation.
Consequently, the Board finds that it would not be appropriate for the Board to proceed further in this matter until the investigation has been concluded and the results of the investigation have been associated with the claims folder.
