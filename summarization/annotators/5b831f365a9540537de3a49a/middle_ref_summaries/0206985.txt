With regard to the question of whether the veteran participated in combat with the enemy during service, the Board observes that he did not have service during a period of war and was not stationed overseas at any time during service. Moreover, the veteran has not in any way alleged that he participated in combat during his military service.
The Board notes that the veteran's service medical records are entirely negative for documentation of his claimed stressors.
While the veteran was treated for right upper extremity symptomatology during service, this was attributed to sports injuries at the time of treatment.
Overall, based upon a review of the entire claims file, the Board finds that the evidence of record shows that the veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD. However, the evidence of record does not in any way reflect participation in combat with the enemy, and there is no evidence showing that the veteran's current diagnosis of PTSD is based upon a verified stressor from service. As such, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
