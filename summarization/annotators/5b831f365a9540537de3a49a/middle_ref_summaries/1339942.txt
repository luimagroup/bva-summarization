There is no evidence that a chronic psychiatric disorder was treated or diagnosed during service or after service.
In addition, there is no indication in any of his service treatment records that he was treated for symptoms consistent with, or diagnosed with, a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.
Therefore, the most probative evidence of record reflects that the Veteran lacks a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, including PTSD under the DSM-IV, during the appeals period.
Absent the required diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, including a DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD, at any time during the appeals period, there is no current disability to attribute to the Veteran's military service, irrespective of the occurrence of a stressor in service.
