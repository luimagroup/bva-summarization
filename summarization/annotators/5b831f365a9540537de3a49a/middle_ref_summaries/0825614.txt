However, the veteran's service personnel records are not currently associated with his claims file,
efforts to obtain them should be made.
The letter sent to the veteran to inform him of the information and evidence necessary to establish his claim, indicated that his claim was for "post pragmatic syndrome" and "post pramatia syndrome," and there is no indication veteran was ever sent a stressor identification letter.
This should be accomplished.
