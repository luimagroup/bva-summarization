The July 1968 separation examination report indicates that the Veteran reported having depression or excessive worry. The record shows current diagnoses of depressive disorder and PTSD.
A VA therapist, from the VA PTSD Clinical Team, provided a July 2016 statement noting diagnoses of persistent depressive disorder and PTSD related to combat he experienced in Vietnam.
She also indicated that the Veteran has consistently reported that symptoms associated with PTSD and depressive disorder began during his service and have caused him significant dysfunction throughout his life.
The Board finds that the medical evidence of record supports the finding that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms are related to his in-service stressors. Consequently, the elements necessary to establish service connection for his psychiatric disorder have been met.
