The veteran's service medical records do not reflect his report of exposure to combat or non-combat stressors.
There is no report that an individual named Purcell was unavailable for duty due to injury or death.
The Board, therefore, finds that the veteran's PTSD is not shown to have its origins in his military service.
The claim for service connection for PTSD, therefore, must be denied.
