Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1957 to March 1961.
The current appeal stems from a November 1992 decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in Fort Harrison, Montana (the RO) which denied the veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, based on lack of new and material evidence.
Dr. J.E. initially determined that it was reasonable to conclude from the medical evidence of record that the veteran had a "traumatic incident" when, at age 18, he accidentally shot a fellow soldier and experienced loss of rank, court-martial and transfer;
Dr. J.E. also noted that there was a diagnosis of anxiety neurosis in the mid 70's, diagnoses of bipolar/mixed affective/cluster C personality traits in the mid 90's, and PTSD/chronic delayed onset and major depressive disorder also in the mid 90's.
Dr. J.E. noted that the presence of Axis II "Personality traits" had been highlighted throughout the years (Passive, Aggressive, Cluster C, etc.); and that the detailed assessment in January 1999 revealed that through the years the veteran experienced the following PTSD symptoms:
With respect to element (1), a current medical diagnosis of PTSD, although there are other psychiatric diagnoses of record, the most common recent diagnosis, in addition to personality disorder, appears to be PTSD. Accordingly, the first element of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) is established.
the service administrative records serve to support the occurrence of the shooting incident and related events during service which the veteran claims caused his PTSD. Thus, the second element in a claim for PTSD is met.
With regard to element (3), nexus, the IME and a number of other psychiatric examiners have associated the diagnosis of PTSD to the accidental discharge of a weapon by the veteran in service. Thus, the Board finds that all three elements of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) have been satisfied.
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.
