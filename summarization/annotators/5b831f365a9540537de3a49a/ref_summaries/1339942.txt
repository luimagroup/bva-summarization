Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from February 1967 to September 1969.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) from an August 2011 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO) in Nashville, Tennessee.
There is no evidence that a chronic psychiatric disorder was treated or diagnosed during service or after service.
In addition, there is no indication in any of his service treatment records that he was treated for symptoms consistent with, or diagnosed with, a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.
Therefore, the most probative evidence of record reflects that the Veteran lacks a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, including PTSD under the DSM-IV, during the appeals period.
Absent the required diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, including a DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD, at any time during the appeals period, there is no current disability to attribute to the Veteran's military service, irrespective of the occurrence of a stressor in service.
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.
