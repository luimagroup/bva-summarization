Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as due to in-service herbicide exposure and as secondary to service-connected diabetes mellitus and/or posttraumatic stress disorder
The Veteran served on active duty from June 1967 to June 1969. He was awarded the Purple Heart and the Combat Infantryman Badge.
This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2008 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Louis, Missouri.
The appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).
the Board referred to the Joint Motion which noted that the Secretary has acknowledged that there is "limited or suggestive evidence of an association between hypertension and exposure to herbicides."
Given the acknowledgement by the Secretary that there is some evidence of an association, this opinion is inadequate as based on an inaccurate premise.
As no opinion has been obtained concerning his new theory of entitlement, the Board finds an additional opinion is necessary as to whether the Veteran's hypertension is caused or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD.
it is unclear as to whether the Veteran's service treatment records are complete. A request for any additional service treatment records should be made.
