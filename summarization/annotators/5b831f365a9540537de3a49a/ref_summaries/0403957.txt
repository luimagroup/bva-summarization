Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had verified active duty from March 1963 to March 1965.
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2002 rating decision by the Hartford, Connecticut, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).
To date, the service department has not been able to verify the veteran's alleged active duty in Vietnam.
In the Board's opinion further development is in order to determine if the veteran did in fact serve in Vietnam.
for the reasons noted above, the Board concludes that additional development of the record is required prior to appellate disposition.
