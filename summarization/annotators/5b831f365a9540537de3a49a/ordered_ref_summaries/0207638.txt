This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 1996 rating decision by the Huntington, West Virginia Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) which denied service connection for PTSD.
In November 1999, the Board remanded the claim to the RO for additional development.
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran had active service from December 1964 to December 1968.
The veteran's service medical records do not reflect his report of exposure to combat or non-combat stressors.
There is no report that an individual named Purcell was unavailable for duty due to injury or death.
The Board, therefore, finds that the veteran's PTSD is not shown to have its origins in his military service.
The claim for service connection for PTSD, therefore, must be denied.
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
