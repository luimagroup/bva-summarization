This matter is on appeal from an April 2005 decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from October 1968 to May 1970.
As an initial matter, although the Veteran stated that the mortar attack in June or July 1969, it appears that the JSRRC only reviewed records from July 1969. In order to prevent prejudice to the Veteran, the relevant records from June 1969 should be reviewed as well.
. While the RO attempted to obtain more information from the Veteran, it is unclear whether the morning reports were actually investigated.
From the Board's view, the PIES response did not answer the RO's request in this matter, and there is no reference to a morning reports search in the RO's June 2010 formal determination that the stressor information was insufficient.
Nevertheless, the Board concludes that a new VA examination is warranted, given the recent change to 38 C.F.R. ï¿½ 3.304 and the receipt of evidence since February 2005.
The Veteran has also been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, which has never been considered by the RO, despite the Veteran's statements that he has been experiencing symptoms since active duty.
Finally, the Board notes that the Veteran is in receipt of disability benefits from the Social Security Administration (SSA) since 1999, but there is no indication that there has been an attempt to acquire the treatment records the SSA may possess.
In general, VA is required to obtain relevant records held by any Federal department or agency that the claimant adequately identifies and authorizes the Secretary to obtain.
