This appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) arises from rating decisions in April 1996 and May 1997 by the Waco, Texas, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The appellant had active air service from June 1968 to March 1969, with time lost by reason of being absent without leave (AWOL) from duty in December 1968 and January 1969.
With regard to the first claimed in-service stressor, the appellant has not submitted any supporting evidence,
With regard to the appellant's second claimed in-service stressor arising out of an alleged collision of two military jeeps,
No supporting evidence whatsoever having been presented or identified, there is no credible evidence that the appellant's second claimed in- service stressor occurred.
Although the appellant received a diagnosis of PTSD during hospitalization in 1995 at a VA medical facility and the record includes subsequent diagnoses of PTSD
, service connection may not be granted for PTSD unless all of the requirements of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) have been fulfilled,
There is no such credible supporting evidence in this case of the occurrence of either of the appellant's two claimed in-service stressors.
The preponderance of the evidence of record is against a grant of service connection for PTSD. The benefit-of-the- doubt doctrine does not apply. See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App 49 (1990). The claim must be denied
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is denied.
