This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 1990 confirmed rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) San Juan, Puerto Rico, Regional Office (RO), which denied a claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from October 1968 to October 1970.
It was noted that the veteran had attended a VA PTSD group, and that, in the subscribing physician's opinion, he was "a severely disabled veteran that is unemployable." Major depression and PTSD were both diagnosed, and similar diagnoses were rendered in August 1990 (after a 43-day VA psychiatric admission), March 1991 (after a 28-day psychiatric admission), June 1991 (after a 22-day psychiatric admission), March 1992 (after a 21-day psychiatric admission), June 1992 (after a 37-day admission), August 1992 (after a 29-day psychiatric admission), October 1992 (after a 23-day psychiatric admission), and April 1993 (after a 22-day admission).
the record shows that the veteran is a combat veteran, who has reported stressful inservice experiences, and he has had multiple hospitalizations in which he has reported symptoms arising from those inservice experiences.
As clearly shown in the above discussion of the pertinent competent evidence of record, several mental health experts have said that the veteran does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, while other mental health experts, particularly those who have treated the veteran during his multiple psychiatric hospitalizations, have indicated that the veteran indeed suffers from PTSD. The Board then finds that the evidence as to whether the veteran has PTSD or not is in relative equipoise. Therefore, resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran, the Board concludes that service connection for PTSD is warranted.
Service connection for PTSD is granted.
