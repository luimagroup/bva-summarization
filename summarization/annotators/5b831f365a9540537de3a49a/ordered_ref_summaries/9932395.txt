This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following an October 1996 decision of the Buffalo, New York, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) which denied a claim of service connection for PTSD.
Entitlement to service connection for a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The veteran served on active duty from July 1968 to July 1970. The veteran also had a subsequent period of unverified service in a reserve component.
Available treatment records show that the veteran was diagnosed with PTSD in August and October 1995.
Subsequent to October 1995, VA treatment records show his complaints and/or treatment for intrusive thoughts and dreams of his combat experience in the Republic of Vietnam, as well as a diagnosis of PTSD.
In addition, at an October 1997 VA examination, after the veteran had discussed his Vietnam experiences (i.e., having engaged in firefights, being wounded by shrapnel, having a friend killed, being on a convoy that was ambushed, and seeing people killed), the examiner noted that he had read the claims file and formed an opinion that the veteran suffered from "schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type with comorbidity of [PTSD] resulting from the combat experience."
As noted above, the evidence of record includes a diagnosis of PTSD by medical personnel and statements from the veteran to the effect that he was exposed to severe stressors in service, including having a friend killed. Additionally, the evidence of record includes medical opinions that specifically relate his PTSD to the foregoing in-service experience. Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997). Under these circumstances, the Board finds that the veteran's claim is well grounded within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.A. ï¿½ 5107 (West 1991). The Board is also satisfied that, with reasonable doubt resolved in the veteran's favor, the evidence supports a grant of service connection.
The veteran has submitted copies of selected pages from the 1968 to 1969 yearbook for the 27th Engineering Battalion. This yearbook contained a picture of the veteran and the friend who was reportedly killed.
Accordingly, the Board finds that, in the current appeal, as in Suozzi, supra, the evidence substantiates a version of events during service which, when viewed most favorably to the veteran, supports his account of what happened. The yearbook and service records are independent descriptions of a significant part of the veteran's version of events.
Given that the October 1997 evaluation report showing PTSD reflected extensive examination and testing, given that examiners who diagnose PTSD must find that the traumatic event is being re-experienced in some way, and because the examiners in this case appear to rely on the existence of the claimed in-service event in reaching the diagnosis of PTSD, the Board finds that the evidence is in relative equipoise on this point.
Service connection for PTSD is granted.
