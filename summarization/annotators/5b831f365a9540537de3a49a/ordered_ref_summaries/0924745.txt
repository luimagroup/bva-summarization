This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2001 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO) in Montgomery, Alabama.
This claim was previously remanded by the Board in March 2005 for additional development.
Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Veteran served on active duty from August 1969 to March 1972 and from June 1979 to December 1991. He also served on active duty from March 1972 to June 1979, except for an unspecified 20 months of inactive service during that period.
However, insufficient efforts have been made to verify the Veteran's alleged in-service stressors. As such, this claim is not ready for appellate review.
The August 2008 JSRRC report makes no mention of the Veteran's April 2008 statement. Therefore, it does not appear that this evidence was considered when denying the Veteran's claim.
the record contains a much more detailed statement from the Veteran that does not appear to have been considered.
