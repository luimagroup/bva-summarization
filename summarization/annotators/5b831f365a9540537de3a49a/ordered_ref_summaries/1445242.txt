This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2005 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Oakland, California.
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression.
The Veteran served on active duty from May 1967 to August 1968.
While the March 2011 VA physician opined that the stressor involving the assault in the shower was not sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD, that opinion appears to be based on the fact that the Veteran was not physically harmed by the stressor.
he Board observes that actual harm is not needed to be a sufficient PTSD stressor.
While the August 2014 private physician opined that the stressor involving the assault in the shower was sufficient and the Veteran has PTSD due to that stressor, that opinion is based on the finding that the Veteran was hypersensitive to stressors.
Without having examined the Veteran, the Board observes that that finding and the resulting opinion are of limited probative value. Thus, the Veteran should be provided another VA examination to determine whether he has a psychiatric disability that had its onset in or is due to active service.
