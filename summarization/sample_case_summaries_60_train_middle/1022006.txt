There is no indication of relevant, available records which would support the Veteran's claim.
Thus, the Board finds that further examination is not necessary.
The Board finds there was substantial compliance with its October 2008 remand instructions.
In sum, there is no competent or credible evidence suggesting that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension during service or within the one year presumptive period following service, nor is there supporting evidence to suggest any continuity of hypertension from service to show a nexus to service.
Considering the totality of the evidence, the Board is presented with an evidentiary record which persuasively weighs against service connection for the Veteran's hypertension as secondary to PTSD.
