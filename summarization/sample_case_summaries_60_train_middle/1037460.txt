In March 2009, the Board instructed the AMC/RO to contact the Veteran and request that he furnish additional information concerning the death of a fellow service member, as noted on his March 2006 Appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (VA Form 9), and then to contact the U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) to attempt to verify the claimed incident.
An October 2009 correspondence to the Veteran documented the AMC/RO's request for the aforementioned information, but the Veteran's apparently failed to respond.
Accordingly, the Board has no choice but to remand the claim once again to obtain a sufficient medical examination.
The claims folder should be reviewed by the examiner and that review should be indicated in the examination report.
The examiner should record the full history of the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, to include a major depressive disorder and PTSD, including the Veteran's own account of the etiology of his disability.
d)  Discuss whether it is at least as likely as not that any other currently diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder is related to the Veteran's period of service and/or any of his service-connected disorders.
