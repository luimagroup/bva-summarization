His service personnel records reflect that he served at Camp Haines, Camp Evans, and the Republic of Vietnam.
After an April 1994 VA examination, the examiner noted that given the veterans on-going alcohol abuse, it was not possible to determine whether the veteran met the criteria for PTSD set forth in the DSM-IIIR.
In March 1994, the veteran submitted a statement to the RO detailing his in service stressors.
Whereas the previously applicable DSM-III-R criteria required that in order to establish a diagnosis of PTSD, the veteran must have undergone an experience which would have been of sufficient gravity to evoke the symptoms of PTSD in almost anyone, and the stressor had to be outside the range of usual human experience, and be markedly distressing to almost anyone, a diagnosis may now be established under DSM-IV when the veteran experiences, witnesses, or is confronted with an event or events that involve actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to his physical integrity or that of others, and his response involves intense fear, helplessness, or horror.
A subsequent letter scheduled him for a hearing before RO personnel, but there was no indication that he asked to be taken off the travel board list.
When the RO is satisfied that the record is complete and the psychiatric examination is adequate for rating purposes, the RO should proceed with an adjudication of the claim on the merits.
