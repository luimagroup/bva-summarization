if the veteran did not receive any of the recognized military citations which indicate combat pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) and no evidence of combat has been presented by the veteran, the Board may properly conclude that the veteran did not engage in combat and the Board is not required, pursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. § 1154(b), to accept his lay testimony as conclusive evidence of the presence of in-service stressors.
During the veterans June 1975 discharge examination, he was again psychiatrically evaluated as normal.
