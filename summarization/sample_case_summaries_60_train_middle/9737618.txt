Through the course of his appeal, the veteran has asserted that certain stressful incidents which occurred while serving in Vietnam led to the development of PTSD.
Additionally, service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence establishing a clear diagnosis of the condition, credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred, and a link, established by the medical evidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.
In view of the foregoing, it is the BoardÂ’s judgment that the RO should obtain additional information from the veteran regarding his alleged in-service stressors and forward this information to the USASCRUR for verification of the stressors.
If indicated, the RO should then schedule a VA psychiatric examination.
