The Veteran contends that he suffers from PTSD which is due to his experiences in service.
A July 2007 VA psychiatry note notes he had been thinking more about Vietnam since his mother's death; sometimes the memories caught him unaware.
The examiner diagnosed residuals, including anxiety disorder NOS, and opined it was at as likely as not incurred in service.
Given the above, the Board will resolve any reasonable doubt as to the existing diagnosis of PTSD in the Veteran's favor and finds that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD.
