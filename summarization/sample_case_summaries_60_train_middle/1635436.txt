In the present case, the Veteran has a diagnosis of hypertension, and the service personnel records show that the Veteran served in Vietnam and is presumed to have been exposed to herbicides during this time.
The Secretary discussed the 2006, 2008, and 2010 Updates, which contain the same analysis with respect to hypertension, in the Federal Register. See e.g. 77 Fed. Reg. 47,924 -01 (Aug. 10, 2012) (noting "[i]n Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 2006 . . . and Update 2008, NAS elevated hypertension to the 'Limited or Suggestive Evidence' category"); 75 Fed. Reg. 32,540, 32,549 (June 8, 2010) ("In Update 2006, NAS concluded that there was 'limited or suggestive evidence of an association between exposure to the compounds of interest and hypertension.'"); 75 Fed. Reg. 81,332, 81,333 (NAS, in 2008, categorized certain health outcomes, including hypertension, to have "'limited or suggestive evidence of an association.'
As a result the Board finds that the VA specialist opinion from May 2016 is most probative.
In conclusion, the Board has competent and credible testimony from the Veteran regarding his exposure to herbicides in-service and a positive probative opinion from a specialist providing a causal connection between the Veteran's hypertension and his active service.
