The Board concludes that all available evidence that is pertinent to the claim decided herein has been obtained and that there is sufficient medical evidence on file on which to make a decision on the issue.
The veteran asserts that he has PTSD caused by stressful events to which he was exposed in service.
Subsequent VA and private treatment records show continued psychiatric problems, including several diagnoses of PTSD.
In order to establish service connection for a veteran who had no combat experience, as here, there must be independent evidence of record to corroborate the veteran's statement as to the occurrence of a claimed stressor.
