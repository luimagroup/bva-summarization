Collectively, the VCAA letters notified the veteran of what information and evidence is needed to substantiate his claim of service connection for PTSD, as well as what information and evidence must be submitted by the claimant, what information and evidence will be obtained by VA, and the need for the claimant to submit any evidence in his possession that pertains to the claim.
Despite initial inadequate notice provided to the veteran, the Board finds no prejudice to him in proceeding with the issuance of a final decision.
The Board also finds that VA has complied with all assistance provisions of VCAA.
If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.
If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
The veteran's DD Form 214 reflects that he served during the Vietnam Era; however, he had no foreign and/or sea service.
Because the record does not persuasively show participation in combat, the claimed stressors must be corroborated.
Thus, the veteran has not furnished any details of alleged stressors to allow for an attempt to verify such claimed stressors.
