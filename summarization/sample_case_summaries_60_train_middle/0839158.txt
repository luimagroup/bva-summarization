Additionally, the RO ascertained that the veteran's alleged assailant served in the military at the same time as the veteran.
In February 2005, the veteran's mental health care provider opined that the veteran's diagnoses of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, and mood disorder were related to an in-service sexual trauma.
