While VA did not provide the Veteran with an examination and/or did not obtain a medical opinion, the Board finds that VA had no obligation to do so in connection with the current appeal because both the STRs and post service treatment records are completely negative for evidence of a diagnosis of PTSD or any other psychiatric disability.
As discussed in further detail below, the Veteran has failed to submit or identify any medical evidence showing a current psychiatric diagnosis of any kind.
While sensitivity to loud noise is the type of symptom capable of lay observation, the record is devoid of evidence to suggest that the Veteran has ever been seen or treated for PTSD or any related psychiatric condition, either during service or after service separation.
Consequently, the probative value of the Veteran's implied or explicit assertions that he has PTSD are greatly outweighed by the objective findings of record.
