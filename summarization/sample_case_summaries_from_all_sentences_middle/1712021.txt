The letter informed the Veteran of what evidence was required to substantiate the claim, and of his and VA's respective duties for obtaining evidence, as well as how disability ratings and effective dates are assigned.
Generally, lay testimony alone is not sufficient to establish that a stressor occurred and the record must contain evidence substantiating the occurrence of the claimed stressors.
In a September 2008 VA examination, the examiner opined that the DSM-IV criteria for a PTSD diagnosis were not met.
Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of PTSD during the pendency of the appeal, but the Veteran does have current diagnoses of panic disorder with agoraphobia and depressive disorder NOS.
The examiner noted that discharge documents were negative for complaints of anxiety, depression, or other psychiatric disorders.
As such, the Board will resolve all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and find that the Veteran's panic disorder and depressive disorder are etiologically related to service.
