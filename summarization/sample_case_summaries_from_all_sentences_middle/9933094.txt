The veteran contends that he developed arrhythmia after taking Nardil, a medication which was prescribed by his VA physicians as treatment for PTSD, which was established as service-connected in 1997.
He reported that since being off of the Nardil for two weeks, he experienced almost hourly palpitations associated with shortness of breath and occasional chest burning.
In any case, the veteran was reassured that the nature of his arrhythmia was benign.
