Resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD-variously diagnosed as bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety-was incurred during active duty service.
After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD have been met.
A review of the record reflects that the Veteran filed his claim to reopen service connection for a psychiatric disorder in April 2002, and since that time, VA treatment records initially discussed several diagnoses, including a history of bipolar I versus bipolar II disorder, mood disorder not otherwise specified, bipolar disorder, and rule out bipolar I disorder.
However, the VA examiner does not discuss the in-service symptoms and in-patient treatment for depression, nor does the VA examiner provide any further rationale for his negative nexus conclusion.
Furthermore, the Veteran also submitted a September 2014 statement from the Veteran's treating psychologist at VA, who determined that the Veteran's "symptoms, significantly affecting his daily functioning, have reportedly been persistent since his time in the service.
This competent evidence strongly supports a finding of in-service incurrence.
