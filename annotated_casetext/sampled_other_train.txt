Alternatively, when a disease at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is not shown to be chronic during service or the one year presumptive period, service connection may also be established by showing continuity of symptomatology after service.
Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 66 (1993); see also 38 U.S.C.A. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).
See Reeves v. Shinseki, 682 F.3d 988, 999 (Fed. Cir. 2012).
The Board acknowledges that blurred vision is listed in a VA Live Manual table as one of the potential physical residuals or sequelae of a TBI.  TBI residuals can resolve in a short period of time, persist chronically or permanently, or may also have a delayed onset.
The Board has also reviewed VA psychiatry notes and history and physicals dated in September 2011, January 2014, December 2015, and August 2016 from the same VA psychiatrist who was familiar with the Veteran due to repeated treatment.
The RO requested copies of the Veteran's service treatment records through the VA Records Management Center, the Marine Corps Reserve Support Command, and the National Personnel Records Management Center.
The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.
Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.
Later in June 1972, the Veteran's condition was evaluated by the Army Medical Board, where it was determined that the Veteran's back condition rendered him physically unfit for active service, and he was subsequently discharged from service.
PTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by the Veteran's active military service.
However, the Board finds that neither examiner provided an adequate level of affirmation of the Veteran's pre-existing condition to rebut the Veteran's presumption of soundness.
The term marker refers to evidentiary signs, events, or circumstances indicating a possibility that the claimed stressor occurred, such as reports, lay statements, or behavioral changes that may be associated with the approximate timeframe of the claimed stressor.
See 38 C.F.R. � 3.156(b).
See M21-1, Part III, Subpart iv, Chapter 4, Section B, Topic 1, Blocks b, c, and e (May 7, 2015).
Evidence received since the November 2005 Board decision is not cumulative of the evidence of record at the time of the last prior denial as it relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim of service connection for PTSD and raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating the Veteran's claim of service connection.
The Veteran was considered to be disabled by the SSA post-service since 1992, after the Veteran injured himself hauling furniture, according to a June 2012 VA psychological examination.
Entitlement to service connection for a chronic acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, MDD, and anxiety, is denied.
That is, lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.
Veterans Law Judge
In July 2014, the Board reopened the claim and subsequently remanded it for additional evidentiary development.
Proper notice from VA must inform the claimant of any information and evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide.
Secondary service connection may also be established for a nonservice-connected disability which is aggravated by a service connected disability.
These VA examinations also considered the Veteran's reported lay history.
This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c) (2016).
As a general matter, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service, and; (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service.
The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from May 1972 to June 1972.
If the determinations remain adverse to the Veteran, he and his representative should be furnished with a Supplemental Statement of the Case.
This evidence is material as it relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim, namely evidence of a diagnosis of PTSD based on a verified stressor.
In fact, secondary evidence or behavior change evidence typically needs interpretation by a clinician in personal trauma claims.

Accordingly, the Board may consider this evidence in the first instance.
The Veteran has reported that in May or June of 1963 near Camp Casey in Korea, he was attacked by two Korean civilians.
Service connection for chronic adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious features is granted.
An application for accrued benefits must be filed within one year after the date of death.
In general, a VA examiner may not rely on the absence of evidence as negative evidence, particularly where there is no indication that the fact should have been recorded.

Service connection may be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated in active military service.
In February 2009, the Veteran attended a Decision Review Officer (DRO) hearing at the RO, and in August 2010, the Veteran attended a Board hearing before the undersigned.
See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 105-106 (2012).
Appellant represented by:	The American Legion
Archive Date: 11/25/15
Per the authority granted in 38 U.S.C.A. � 7109 and 38 C.F.R. � 20.901, the Board requested that a medical expert from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) render an opinion regarding the potential relationship between a psychiatric disorder and service.
Subject to the provisions governing the award of monetary benefits, service connection for left eye blindness with loss of visual acuity as secondary to a service-connected TBI with a fracture of the left zygoma, is granted.
To this end, the Board notes that the Veteran has submitted several lay statements from his co-worker/classmates and his sports coach during high school, noting that they witnessed and knew of no evidence that the Veteran suffered from any type of back condition.
The Veteran also reported "erythematous scaling rash in face and ears" for the past 10 years.
The resultant disabling effects of a TBI event beyond those that follow immediately from the acute injury to the brain are known as TBI residuals or TBI sequelae.
As will be discussed below, these VA examinations were thorough, supported by explanations, based on a review of the claims folder, and supported by clinical evidence of record.
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION
38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (2016).
Several of the Veteran's National Guard examinations are of record, and furthermore, the Veteran has asserted that her psychiatric problems began in 1985 or 1986, after the birth of her son, which is both after her National Guard service and several years after her active duty from December 1981 to May 1982.
Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition; a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.
At that point, however, a veteran still must establish that he has a current disability that is related to the in-service injury or disease.
In Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004), the Court held that a VCAA notice, as required by 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a), must be provided to a claimant before the initial unfavorable agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on the claim for VA benefits.
The preponderance of the evidence indicates that, for years following service, the Veteran did not have characteristic manifestations sufficient to identify a chronic disease entity.
Left Eye Blindness with Loss of Visual Acuity
The attention of the RO is specifically directed to records from the D. S., LCSW.
VA optometrists added that although the Veteran's left eye cataract was consistent  with reduced vision, the loss of visual acuity still appears to VA medical professionals to be worse than expected with a cataract alone.
The RO was also requested to send the Veteran a letter informing her of the information and evidence required to substantiate her claim for service connection for PTSD in cases alleging PTSD due to personal assault.
That letter was send.
Initially, the Board notes that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record.
The Federal Circuit noted that "a consequence of the derivative nature of the surviving spouse's entitlement to a veteran's accrued benefits claim is that, without the veteran having a claim pending at time of death, the surviving spouse has no claim upon which to derive his or her own application."
Upon examination of the Veteran and his medical history, both VA examiners initially noted that the Veteran's back condition more likely than not pre-existed his service.
The Veteran is also competent to testify about observable symptoms or injury residuals.
On Report of Medical History completed by the Veteran in June 1984, he noted foot trouble; in response, the examiner noted soft tissue strain both knees and ankles after joining Marine Corps during boot camp which resolved after boot camp.
Citation Nr: 1615630
Thereafter, the Veteran should be afforded a VA psychiatric examination.
The Military Police Office requested names and social security numbers of the casualties with an exact date.

See also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).
38 U.S.C.A. § 1111 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b) (2015).
Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, the extensive evidence of record.
Service Connection - Back Condition
If PTSD is not diagnosed, indicate clearly what symptom(s) needed for such diagnosis is/are lacking.
DATE
Further, "mental health professionals are experts and are presumed to know the DSM requirements applicable to their practice and to have taken them into account in providing a PTSD diagnosis."
In addition, these disabilities did not develop post-service as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected TBI.
See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 548 (1993); Sklar v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 140 (1993); Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467 (1993).

Many of the records show that the image obtained was the "best image" available even where the image remains illegible.

This connection or etiology is not amenable to observation alone.
These VA eye notes and examinations provide strong evidence in support of the left eye claim.
Thus, DSM-IV is still the governing directive.
Therefore, any such error is harmless and does not prohibit consideration of this matter on the merits.
See 73 Fed. Reg. 23,353-23,356 (April 30, 2008).
38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 1131 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R.        § 3.303(a) (2011).
See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).
See 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3 (2011).
The Board must consider the type of condition specifically claimed and whether it is readily amenable to lay diagnosis or probative comment on etiology.
As the July 2009 VA examination did not address the etiology of the Veteran's lateral meniscus tear or his ACL condition, a new examination is necessary.
38 U.S.C.A. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. §§§ 3.159(c), (d).
The law requires only that the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the claimant.
With respect to CUE, an April 2012 rating decision addresses CUE in a September 1971 rating decision.
In such circumstances, service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis for any disease listed in 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(e).
Importantly, the Veteran is already service-connected for a broad array of residuals of his in-service TBI.
See http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Chronologies/Yearly/1991.htm and http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Chronologies/Yearly/1992.htm.
To the extent that the Veteran has offered his own opinion concerning the etiology of his respiratory disability, he has not demonstrated that he has any knowledge or training in determining the etiology of such conditions.
Additionally, new and material evidence was received with the time to appeal a December 2010 rating decision in the form of a July 2011 private treatment record.

Preliminary Discussion of Already Service-Connected TBI Injury
Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995).
The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from May 1974 to May 1975.
38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2016).
Thus, the evidence clearly reveals current bilateral eye disabilities for the Veteran as assessed by VA eye physicians.
No medical professional of record has assessed additional neurological impairment to the face as a residual of the Veteran's TBI, aside from the motor activity mildly decreased or with moderate slowing due to "apraxia."
In order to rebut the presumption of sound condition, VA must show by clear and unmistakable (obvious or manifest) evidence both (1) that the disease or injury existed prior to service and (2) that the disease or injury was not aggravated by service.
Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.
See VAOPGCPREC 82-90, VAOPGCPREC 67-90.
In addition, the record indicates that the Veteran has left upper lid ptosis due to CVA as well as depression and anxiety due to stroke.
Consequently, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, must be reopened.
See Bonny v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 504, 507 (2002).
Because the Veteran is no longer represented by the FDVA, the Board finds it unnecessary to return the claims folder.
Finally, the February 2017 VA TBI examiner found no evidence of cranial nerve dysfunction.
Entitlement to service connection for a bilateral hip disability.
Consequently, service connection for PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder is warranted.
The rationale was that "traumatic" cataracts would have a stellate appearance, but in contrast the Veteran has nuclear and cortical cataracts which are usually caused by aging.
A statement of the case (SOC) was issued in March 2006, and the Veteran filed a substantive appeal (via a VA Form 9, Appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals) in May 2006.
DOCKET NO.  06-14 708
The Board notes that the presumption of soundness applies only when a disease or injury not noted upon entry to service manifests in service, and a question arises as to whether it preexisted service.
VA has a duty to notify and to assist the Veteran in the development of his claims.
The RO was instructed to request any outstanding information or records.
The Veteran had verified active duty from December 1981 to May 1982.
See Bloom, supra.
In doing so, please address whether any of the performance/disciplinary problems which the Veteran had in service represented symptoms of a current psychiatric disability.
As such, the Board finds that the evidence of record does not rise to the level as to rebut the presumption of soundness and an evaluation of service connection, on a direct basis must be made.
Decision Date: 04/27/17
This case was previously remanded in May 2011 and July 2014.
The prior version of 38 U.S.C.A. § 5121(a) provided for 1) periodic payments to which an individual was entitled at death under existing ratings for decisions; or 2) periodic monetary benefits based on evidence in the file at the date of an entitled individual's death and due and unpaid for a period not to exceed two years.
The Veteran had active duty service from May 1961 to April 1964 in the United States Army.
The Veteran also noted pain with palpation of plantar aponeurosis, and mild triceps equinous.
Moreau, 9 Vet. App. at 396.
She also had subsequent service in the United States Marine Corp Reserves.
Service connection for PTSD has unique evidentiary requirements.
The opinions provided must specifically reflect consideration of the Veteran's military performance evaluations and his post service VA and private treatment records and examination reports.
Finally, the Veteran submitted additional VA treatment records and Vet Center records in January 2017, after certification of his appeal.
To address whether the Veteran's current respiratory problems were related to his in-service treatment or otherwise caused by his military service, the matter was referred for a VA medical opinion.
The issue of entitlement to service connection for a bilateral knee condition is addressed in the REMAND portion of the decision below and is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).
See Cohen, 10 Vet. App. at 146-47; see also Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 394-95 (1996).
The evidence also indicates that the Veteran experienced a skin disorder during service.
And the Veteran did not mention skin problems in multiple claims he filed following service, prior to his original service connection claim for skin disability in 1990.
If a current psychiatric disorder was not present during service then is it at least as likely as not (50 percent or greater probability) that the current psychiatric disorder is otherwise etiologically related to the Veteran's period of active service?
When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the claimant.
J. Acosta, Associate Counsel
The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) substantially complied with the remand order, and the Board finds that it may proceed with a decision at this time.
The Veteran presented sworn testimony at a hearing before a Decision Review Officer in October 2007.
The Veteran's second VA C&P examination, in January 2015, provides a confusing and nearly contradictory conclusion and rationale.
Kate Sosna, Associate Counsel
The appeal is once again before the Board for review.
The Board must assess the credibility and weight of all evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant.
The Veteran seeks service connection for a psychiatric disorder.
In September 2014, the Court granted the Joint Motion for Partial Remand (Joint Motion); vacated that portion of the March 2014 Board decision which denied service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and major depression, and entitlement to a TDIU rating; and remanded the appeal to the Board for additional action consistent with the Joint Motion.
Satisfactory lay or other evidence that an injury or disease was incurred or aggravated in combat will be accepted as sufficient proof of service connection if the evidence is consistent with the circumstances, conditions or hardships of such service even though there is no official record of such incurrence or aggravation.
This notice must be provided prior to an initial unfavorable decision on a claim by the agency of original jurisdiction.
See Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 140 (1997).
A VA Form 4597, Board of Veterans' Appeals Notice, was attached to that decision and neither the Veteran, nor a representative, filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.
See Bloom v. West, 12 Vet. App. 185, 187 (1999) (the value of a physician's statement is dependent, in part, upon the extent to which it reflects clinical data or other rationale to support the opinion).
38 U.S.C.A. � 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).
Again, the Veteran has not submitted any medical evidence to the contrary.
If it is determined that a psychiatric disorder did not exist prior to service, the examiner should reconcile such finding with the December 2012 VA examination report, which includes the finding that the Veteran's depression predated service.
See 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c) (2015); Bryant v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 488, 492 (2010).
At this time, in order to comply with the above case-law and allow the broadest possible interpretation of his claims in light of the evidence of record, the Board has revised the Veteran's original claim in the title page.
At the outset, the Board emphasizes that in the present decision it is service-connecting the Veteran for left eye blindness with loss of visual acuity as secondary to the service-connected TBI with a fracture of the left zygoma.
On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Salt Lake City, Utah
The Veteran served on active duty from August 1967 to August 1969.
A history of a pre-service injury, of itself, is not a notation of a disability on service entrance, and does not suffice to rebut the presumption of soundness in the face of a normal clinical evaluation on service entrance.
The presumption of soundness applies only where there is evidence that a disease or injury was not noted upon entry into service manifested or was incurred in service.
38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304 (2015).
In December 2013, the Veteran testified at a videoconference hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge.
Additionally, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f), VA can submit any evidence, including alternate source evidence, to a medical or mental health professional for interpretation.

In Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disorder that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and other information of record.
Lay testimony alone can be used to establish the occurrence of an in-service stressor in these situations.
If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.
In addition, there is no current diagnosis of pes planus of record.
C. Ryan, Associate Counsel
In order for a claimant to be granted service connection for a claimed disability, there must be evidence of a current disability.
38 U.S.C.A. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).
See Archbold v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 124, 130 (1996) (stating that pursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. § 7105(a), the filing of a notice of disagreement initiates appellate review in the VA administrative adjudication process, and the request for appellate review is completed by the claimant's filing of a substantive appeal after a statement of the case is issued by VA.)
Therefore, in affording the Veteran the benefit-of-the-doubt, the Veteran's claim of service connection for a back condition must be granted.
Whether there was clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in a September 1971 rating decision that denied the claim of service connection for chronic anxiety state.
Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (lay testimony is competent to describe observations, but must be weighed against the other evidence of record).
Where a preexisting disease or injury is noted on the entrance examination, 38 U.S.C.A. � 1153 provides that "[a] preexisting injury or disease will be considered to have been aggravated by active military, naval, or air service, where there is an increase in disability during such service, unless there is a specific finding that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease."
This information was then shared with the Military Police Office at Camp Pendleton.
However, November 2010, January 2011, May 2011, and August 2011 VA eye notes opined there was visual loss of the left eye of +2' due to trauma from the 1963 service-connected TBI.
Based on the above evidence, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for a respiratory disability is denied.
Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.
Subject to the provisions governing the award of monetary benefits, service connection for PTSD with depression and polysubstance abuse is granted.
The December 2014 Remand Argument notes that the Veteran's treatment records from D. S., LCSW (licensed clinical social worker), have not been obtained and provides the contact information for this clinician.
See Bagby v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 225, 227 (1991).
However, the remaining two elements of service connection are not met for these particular eye disorders.
See, e.g., Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384 (1993); VAOPGCPREC 16-92, 57 Fed. Reg. 49,747 (1992).
Veteran represented by:	The American Legion
38 C.F.R. � 3.310(a).
Once the presumption of soundness is applied, if the Secretary is unable to rebut the presumption, the disease or injury that manifested in service is deemed incurred in service, such that the second element of service connection is established.
See Alemany and Gilbert, both supra.
The Veteran asserts that his current diagnosed back condition is due to an injury he incurred while performing maneuvers during boot-camp during his military service.
Appellant represented by:	Joseph R. Moore, Esq.
See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102.
In the report, the examiner also detailed the Veteran's medical history of skin problems.
When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the appellant prevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against a claim, in which case, the claim is denied.
The criteria for entitlement to service connection for MDD, dysthymia and depressive disorder NOS are met.
The claim for service connection for residuals of a left eye injury loss is well grounded, and to this extent, the appeal is granted, subject to the development requested below.
Suozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307, 311 (1997).

However, the Veteran was provided adequate VCAA notice for the appeal in May 2004, August 2004, December 2004, April 2005, June 2005, March 2006, and April 2006.
See Id. at Block e.
But the Veteran's lay assertions in the present case are outweighed by the clinical findings of the October 2011 VA eye examiner, who determined that the Veteran's current bilateral eye disabilities did not originate during service or as the result of the Veteran's TBI.
Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).
In this case, as pes planus was noted on his entrance examination, the presumption of soundness does not apply.
The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.
Citation Nr: 1713743
This would entail consideration of non-presumptive service connection, established by the evidence of record.
As the opinion is based on the evidence of record detailed earlier, and is explained, the opinion is of probative value.

This recent regulatory change has eliminated the requirement for submitting credible supporting evidence of the claimed in-service stressor if it is related to the veteran's "fear of hostile military or terrorist activity."
38 U.S.C.A. � 3.307(a)(6)(iii).
In addition, the notice requirements of the VCAA apply to all five elements of a service-connection claim, including: (1) veteran status; (2) existence of a disability; (3) a connection between the veteran's service and the disability; (4) degree of disability; and (5) effective date of the disability.
Service treatment records do show that in May and August 1966, the Veteran was treated for a cold along with chest pain, coughing, and vomiting.
The Veteran initially requested a Travel Board hearing.
Citation Nr: 1632746
Where a Veteran served for at least 90 days during a period of war or after December 31, 1946, and manifests certain chronic diseases, including psychoses, to a degree of 10 percent within one year from the date of termination of such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred or aggravated in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.

The Veteran was an active participant in the claims process, identifying pertinet medical evidence and submitting evidence.
38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(2).
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.
C.
38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b)(1).
Service connection requires evidence satisfying three criteria:  (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship ("nexus") between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.
The Veteran served on active duty from May 1968 to June 1969.
See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).
While the appeal was in development, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) recognized the widely-held view that the absence of an entry in a record may which would ordinarily be recorded gives rise to a legitimate negative inference that the event did not occur; Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 224 (2011); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 440 (2011) (Lance, J., concurring) (citing the Federal Rules of Evidence for the proposition that "the absence of an entry in a record may be evidence against the existence of a fact if such a fact would ordinarily be recorded").
See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009) (holding that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record).
38 U.S.C.A. § 7107(a)(2) (West 2014).
The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.
Service connection for major depressive disorder, dysthymia and depressive disorder NOS is granted.
The Board notes that the weight of a medical opinion is diminished where that opinion is ambivalent, based on an inaccurate factual premise, based on an examination of limited scope, or where the basis for the opinion is not stated.
Accordingly, service connection for the Veteran's respiratory disability must denied pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.300(a).
See also Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181, 182 (1998) (in the absence of medical evidence that does so, VA is precluded from differentiating between symptomatology attributed to a nonservice-connected disability and symptomatology attributed to a service-connected disability).
Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 86-87 (2009); see also Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009) (stating that, when determining the scope of a claim, the Board must consider the claimant's description of the claim; the symptoms the claimant describes; and the information the claimant submits or that the Secretary obtains in support of that claim).
The evidence in this case is not so evenly balanced so as to allow application of the benefit-of- the-doubt rule.
In short, in order to establish entitlement to service connection on this secondary basis, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) probative evidence establishing a nexus (i.e., link) between the service-connected disability and the current disability.
Entitlement to service connection for Crohn's Disease, for purposes of accrued benefits.
See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting general competence to testify as to symptoms but not to provide medical diagnosis).
The Veteran was also provided with VA examinations which, collectively, contain a description of the history of the disabilities at issue; document and consider the relevant medical facts and principles; and provide opinions regarding the etiology of the Veteran's claimed conditions.
Accordingly, as evaluation of the same disability or the same manifestations of disability under multiple diagnoses (i.e., pyramiding) is to be avoided, service connection or secondary service connection for separate nerve damage to the face is not warranted.
Service connection for Crohn's disease, for purposes of accrued benefits, is granted.
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with depression and polysubstance abuse, based on an alleged personal assault.
Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.
In addition, for chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(a) - such as glaucoma - service connection may be established by showing continuity of symptoms, which requires a claimant to demonstrate (1) that a condition was "noted" during service; (2) evidence of post-service continuity of symptoms; and (3) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a link between the present disability and the post-service symptoms.
The March 2009 letter from the AOJ, for example, followed the February 2009 Remand in which the Board advised the Veteran of the elements required to establish service connection for PTSD and the types of evidence that tend to substantiate claims of physical or sexual assault in service.
In granting service connection for PTSD with depression, the RO should assign a disability rating or ratings that encompass the symptoms of these disorders.
In assessing this claim, the Board has considered the Veteran's assertions regarding skin disability, particularly that his problems relate to herbicides exposure.
Indeed, the Federal Circuit has held that the Board must review the entire record, but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence.
The Veteran served on active duty from January 1977 to January 1981.
Under 38 U.S.C.A. � 7252 (West 2014), only a decision of the Board of Veterans' Appeals is appealable to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.
38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (2015); Bryant v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 488, 492, 496 (2010).
However, the Veteran was provided adequate VCAA notice for these issues in October 2010, November 2010, September 2011, November 2011, and July 2012 letters.
In essence, efforts to obtain these SSA records are clearly not warranted, as they are not relevant to the claims being denied and would provide no reasonable possibility of substantiating the claims on appeal.
This matter initially came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2004 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in New Orleans, Louisiana, which denied service connection for PTSD.
Id. (citing Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2009) ("The presumption of soundness . . . does not relieve the veteran of the obligation to show the presence of a current disability and to demonstrate a nexus between that disability and the in-service injury or disease or aggravation thereof.")).
On the Report of Medical History completed by the Veteran in conjunction with his entrance physical, he denied ever having foot trouble.
Jurisdiction has since been transferred to the VA RO in Denver, Colorado.
Although the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's argument that he began smoking in service due, in part, to the cigarettes he was provided by the military, Congress has spoken to this issue in 38 U.S.C.A. § 1103, and prohibited service connection for disabilities based upon effects of tobacco products.
See Soyini v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 (1991) (strict adherence to requirements of the law does not dictate an unquestioning, blind adherence in the face of overwhelming evidence in support of the result in a particular case; such adherence would result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the appellant); Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (remands which would only result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the appellant are to be avoided).
"[F]ear of hostile military or terrorist activity" means that a Veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the Veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the Veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror.
In January 2013, the Board obtained an expert medical opinion from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) regarding whether the Veteran had any psychiatric disorders that pre-existed service.
See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 54-55 (2012)
Winsett v. West, 11 Vet. App. 420 (1998), aff'd 217 F.3d 854 (Fed. Cir. 1999).
It is therefore unnecessary to examine causality, or consider VA's presumption of soundness under 38 U.S.C.A. � 1111, because personality disorders cannot legally be service-related.
In addition, the April 2011 examiner opined that "I can see no evidence that any aspect of his military service caused his current lung condition . . . separate from his history of use of tobacco products." (emphasis added).
The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a respiratory disability, to include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), have not been met.
The Veteran says he did not receive any medical treatment for the blurred vision until VA treatment in 2010.
Entitlement to an initial evaluation in excess of 10 percent prior to March 24, 2010, and in excess of 20 percent since March 24, 2010, for left knee degenerative joint disease.
The VCAA also redefines the obligations of VA with respect to its statutory duty to assist veterans in the development of their claims.
If a PTSD claim is based on in-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than the Veteran's service records may corroborate the Veteran's account of the stressor incident.
The VA examiner must provide a detailed rationale for all opinions rendered.
Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. �4.125(a), if the diagnosis of a mental disorder does not conform to DSM-IV or is not supported by the findings on the examination report, the rating agency shall return the report to the examiner to substantiate the diagnosis.
To the extent the Veteran alleged CUE in the December 2011 rating decision.
The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in October 2011.
A medical professional's opinion based on a post-service examination of a veteran is not competent evidence that an in-service stressor occurred.
Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 120-121 (2004).
The examiner explained that the Veteran was treated in service for upper respiratory infections, which are a common illness and not indicative of a chronic disability.
See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007) (although the claimant is competent in certain situations to provide a diagnosis of a simple condition such as a broken leg or varicose veins, the claimant is not competent to provide evidence as to more complex medical questions).
A review of the documents in Virtual VA reveals that, with the exception of a copy of the September 2013 Board hearing transcript and VA treatment records dated through November 2012, which were considered by the RO in the November 2012 supplemental statement of the case, they are either duplicative of the evidence in the paper claims file or are irrelevant to the issue on appeal.
The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a back condition have been met.
This nexus determination is based on a weighing of the evidence by the preponderance of the evidence standard, with the benefit of the doubt given to the veteran.
Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.
"To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service"-the so-called "nexus" requirement."
In deciding whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD, it is the responsibility of the Board to weigh the evidence and decide where to give credit and where to withhold the same and, in so doing, accept certain medical opinions over others.
DOCKET NO.  06-13 505
Military sexual trauma is a subset of personal trauma and refers to sexual harassment, sexual assault, or rape that occurs in a military setting.
In the present case, the RO certified the Veteran's PTSD appeal to the Board in March 2015, which is after August 4, 2014.
See Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 394 (1996).

For the foregoing reasons, the Board concludes that VA made all reasonable efforts to obtain evidence necessary to substantiate the Veteran's claim.
See 38 U.S.C.A. § 1110 (West 1991); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) (1999).

For the showing of chronic disease such as glaucoma in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word "chronic."
Service Connection - Acquired Psychiatric Condition, PTSD
Thereafter, the case should be returned to the Board for further appellate consideration, if in order.
The Board notes that, in addition to the paper claims file, the Veteran also has electronic Virtual VA and Veteran Benefits Management System (VBMS) paperless claims files.
See Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096.
The issues of entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the feet, and entitlement to a temporary total disability rating for left great toe surgery, were remanded in November 2011 along with the claim currently on appeal.

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.
Therefore, the Board will consider all of these disorders on a non-presumptive basis as well.
Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004).
The Board recognizes that there is no bright line rule that laypersons are not competent to offer etiology opinions.
38 C.F.R. § 3.300(a).
Absent probative or reliable evidence of any current, distinct neurological symptomatology to the face other than the Veteran's already service-connected apraxia, service connection cannot be granted in the present case.
Id. at 118.
This presumption likewise can be rebutted only by clear and unmistakable evidence (of non-aggravation).
See also 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d) (pertaining to combat Veterans).
See Murphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 78, 81-82 (1990); Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992).
Clear and unmistakable evidence includes medical facts and principles which may be considered to determine whether the increase is due to the natural progress of the disability at issue.
However, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) and private medical treatment records reveal that the Veteran has been diagnosed with and treated for a cough along with sinusitis and bronchitis.
38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).
Rather it is common knowledge that such relationships are the subject of extensive research by scientific and medical professionals.
(c)
The appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matters the Board has remanded.
The Board finds that such VA examination and accompanying opinion is adequate to decide the issue as they are predicated on an interview with the Veteran; a review of the record, to include his service treatment records; and a mental status examination.
Personal trauma for the purpose of VA disability compensation claims based on PTSD refers broadly to stressor events involving harm perpetrated by a person who is not considered part of an enemy force.
Material evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim.
Thus, for the foregoing reasons, the claim for service connection for pes planus must be denied.
38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1116, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.306, 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e).

The Board acknowledges the argument of the Veteran's attorney that improper development was completed, citing the Court's decision in Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305 (2003).
See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed.Cir.2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F. 3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table).
I.  Duties to Notify and Assist
However, corroboration of every detail of a claimed stressor, including the veteran's personal participation, is not required; rather, a veteran only needs to offer independent evidence of a stressful event that is sufficient to imply his or her personal exposure.
38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.310(a), (d).

See 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 5103, 5103A (West 2002 & Supp. 2011); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (2011).
As the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim to service connection for lipomas and seborrheic dermatitis, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply, and the claim must be denied.
Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.
The term "at least as likely as not" does not mean within the realm of possibility, but rather that the evidence both for and against a conclusion is so evenly divided that it is as sound to find in favor of a certain conclusion as it is to find against it.
The Veteran contended that his left knee pain was secondary to a right knee condition.

See YR v. West, 11 Vet. App. 393, 399 (1998); Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272 (1999); M21-1, Part III, para.5.14d; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3).
38 C.F.R. � 3.303(c).  See, e.g., Browder v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 204 (1991) (pertaining to refractive error).
That revision provides that, in certain circumstances, a veteran who has been diagnosed with PTSD by a VA or VA-contracted psychiatrist or psychologist based on a claimed stressor that is related to the veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor with lay testimony alone.
In a June 2011 decision, the Board denied the claims for service connection of PTSD and a psychiatric disorder other than PTSD.
The Veteran's claims file is now wholly electronic.
Moreover, for both the left face nerve damage and bilateral eye issues on appeal, neither the Veteran nor his representative has advanced any procedural arguments in relation to VA's duties to notify and assist.
Id.; see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) (2014).
Service connection for PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder is granted.
If the presumption of soundness has not been rebutted, the disease or injury that manifested in service is deemed incurred in service, such that the second element of service connection is established.
See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) and 38 C.F.R. � 4.125 (requiring PTSD diagnoses to conform to the DSM-IV-V).
Entitlement to service connection for brain aneurysm and stroke.
Furthermore, the Board does not dispute the Veteran's assertions that she requested maternity leave in 1985 while serving in the National Guard and that her request was refused by her superior officer; confirmation of these events through service records is therefore unnecessary.
See id. at 1094 (holding that Congress intended to "convert aggravation claims to ones for service connection when the government fails to overcome the presumption of soundness under section 1111").
See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).
He also had a debridement arthroscopy of the right knee in August 2010.
Finally, the third prong to establish service connection, also known as the nexus element, has also been established by the evidence of record.
Aggravation may not be conceded where the disability underwent no increase in severity during service on the basis of all the evidence of record pertaining to the manifestations of the disability prior to, during, and subsequent to service.
