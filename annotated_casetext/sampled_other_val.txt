X-rays revealed a "posterior horn, lateral meniscus possible tear" of the right knee.
However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, that doctrine is not applicable.
As such, in order to make a finding that the Veteran in this case did not have a valid PTSD diagnosis, the Board must clearly articulate its reasons for finding that the PTSD diagnosis was not made in accordance with the DSM-IV requirements.
This may be considered in the Board's evaluation of the evidence.
For all the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that service connection for a left knee disability must be denied.
Establishment of service connection for PTSD in particular requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.
In September 2010, the Board remanded the claims for further development, including a VA examination.
After-the-fact medical nexus evidence cannot be the sole evidence of the occurrence of the claimed stressor.
Effective July 13, 2010, if a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to that Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that a Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of that Veteran's service, a Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
A transcript of the hearing is associated with the claims file.
A medical examination report or opinion must also "contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two."
Although there is a passing reference to CUE in the SOC, a reasonable person would not understand this was a SOC for that issue as the issue was not listed on the SOC (or the SSOC) and there is little to no discussion of that potential issue or identification of any prior decision being challenged.

If the Board cannot support a conclusion that the diagnosis was not made in accordance with DSM-IV requirements, it must accept the diagnosis as valid.

See Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

She had additional duty with the Indiana Army National Guard/Army Reserve.
If the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.

See Jones v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 134, 137-38 (1994).  As the Veteran and his representative are not shown to be other than laypersons without the appropriate medical training and expertise, neither is competent to render a probative (persuasive) opinion on such a medical matter.  See, e.g., Bostain v. West, 11 Vet. App. 124, 127 (1998), citing Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492 (1992).  See also Routen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 183, 186 (1997) ("a layperson is generally not capable of opining on matters requiring medical knowledge").

Thus she has been provided with a meaningful opportunity to participate in the claims process and has done so.
A further Remand or further attempt to develop the claim would be fruitless, and is not required.
Current visual acuity in the left eye was 20/400, while in the right eye it was much better at 20/30+.
The Veteran was also afforded VA examinations and opinions in October 2011 and February 2017 to determine the etiology of his left face nerve damage and bilateral eye disability, to include as secondary to a service-connected TBI.
In addition, VA eye notes dated in October 2013 and August 2014 reflected that visual acuity in the left eye was reduced, but the etiology was unclear.
The Veteran should be advised that he may also submit any evidence or further argument relative to the claim at issue.
See Jandreau, supra.
Upon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application for benefits, VA is required to notify the claimant and her representative, if any, of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, that is necessary to substantiate the claim.
Upon review of the evidence of record, the Board concludes that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection or secondary service connection for left face nerve damage.
INTRODUCTION
In reaching the conclusion above the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.
PTSD was incurred as a result of active duty service.
