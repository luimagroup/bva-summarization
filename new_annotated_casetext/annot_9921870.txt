#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran served on active duty from August 1960 to August 1961.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Jackson, Mississippi, which denied entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
Accordingly, there was no mention of the veteran's active duty service in connection with the diagnosis of PTSD at the time it was made.

#Evidential Support#
the Board has also considered the statement of the veteran's friend that she has known the veteran for two years and was told by the veteran that she had been raped in service.

#Evidential Support#
The testimony, in 1996, does not provide a basis for relating PTSD to service, some 35 years earlier, nor is she competent to make that medical connection.

#Reasoning#
the veteran has failed to show a medical nexus between service and PTSD, as required by law, and the claim must be denied.

#Outcome#
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
