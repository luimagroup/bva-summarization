#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty from February 1972 to May 1973.

#Procedural History#
This matter is on appeal from a November 2009 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

#Evidential Support#
Initially, the Board observes that following the Veteran's September 2016 VA examination, the VA examiner determined that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of PTSD.

#Reasoning#
In light of the competent medical evidence of record, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence of record indicates that the Veteran does not currently have a diagnosis of PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
Despite having a current medical disability, and an in-service injury, the competent medical evidence of record does not establish that the Veteran's current unspecified depressive disorder is related to the mental health symptoms and disorder diagnosed during the Veteran's active service.

#Reasoning#
The Board concludes that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for service connection for the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder.

#Outcome#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.
