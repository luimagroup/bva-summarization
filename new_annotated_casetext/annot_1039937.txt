#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for peptic ulcer disease including as secondary to service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty from April 1972 to May 1975.

#Procedural History#
This appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2005 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO.

#Evidential Support#
In September 2009, a VA physician noted a review of the claims file and the Veteran's report of receiving a diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease with gastroesophageal reflux disease in 1977, regular use of over-the-counter and prescription medication for stomach acidity, and current symptoms of acid reflux, heartburn, and indigestion on a daily basis.

#Evidential Support#
Service connection for peptic ulcer disease is not warranted on a direct basis because there is no credible lay or medical evidence that the disease first manifested in service or within the presumptive period after service.

#Reasoning#
There is no credible lay or medical evidence that the disease is directly related to any aspect of service.

#Evidential Support#
The Board concludes that service connection for peptic ulcer disease is warranted on a secondary basis as a result of service- connected substance and alcohol abuse.

#Reasoning#
As substance and alcohol abuse has been determined to be service-connected and as the physician concluded that the abuse was a contributing and proximately aggravating factor, secondary service connection for peptic ulcer disease is warranted.

#Outcome#
Service connection for peptic ulcer disease is granted, subject to the legal criteria governing the payment of monetary benefits.
