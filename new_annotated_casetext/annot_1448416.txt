#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran had active service from November 1971 to December 1975.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2011 rating decision of the above Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

#Evidential Support#
The STRs do not show any complaints considered by medical personnel as related to an acquired psychiatric disability.

#Evidential Support#
When discharged from service in 1975, the Veteran denied ever experiencing depression or excessive worry, nervous trouble of any sort, or any illness other than those he already identified.

#Reasoning#
The Board finds that the December 1973 incident in which the Veteran killed a man was willful misconduct.

#Evidential Support#
While the Veteran has consistently described the man who was killed as being the attacker, the incident happened when he was buying illegal drugs, and to cover up the events, he weighed down the body with rocks and disposed of it in a river.

#Reasoning#
Although a nexus has been made between PTSD and the December 1973 in-service incident, service connection for PTSD must be denied because compensation may not be paid for diseases or disabilities that are due to willful misconduct.

#Evidential Support#
He was not diagnosed with an acquired psychiatric disability until several years after service.

#Reasoning#
The Board also notes that the VA treatment records do not show that the Veteran has always been truthful when describing his symptoms.

#Reasoning#
The treatment records, including the January 2011 and July 2013 statements from treating providers, do not indicate that an acquired psychiatric disorder is due to any event, disease or injury from military service that was not willful misconduct.

#Outcome#
Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, is denied.
