#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from February 1968 to April 1970.

#Procedural History#
This appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) arose from a December 2007 rating decision in which the RO, inter alia, denied service connection for PTSD.

#Outcome#
For reasons expressed below, the matter on appeal is being remanded to the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

#Evidential Support#
The claims file currently includes VA treatment records from the Prescott VA Medical Center (VAMC), dated from June 2000 through March 2014; and from the Las Vegas VAMC dated from March 2011 through April 2016.

#Evidential Support#
hus, outstanding mental health records-to include Prescott VAMC records dated since March 2014 , and Las Vegas VAMC records dated since April 2016-likely exist.

#Reasoning#
Hence, the AOJ should obtain all outstanding, pertinent records of mental evaluation and/or treatment of the Veteran, following the procedures prescribed in 38 C.F.R. ï¿½ 3.159(c) as regards requests for records from Federal facilities.
