#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran had active duty in the Army from June 1953 to Sepember 1958, and in the Air Force from October 1958 to May 1973, at which point he retired based on 20 years of service.

#Procedural History#
He appeals to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an RO decision which denied service connection for PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
The veteran has reported particular service stressors, but the RO has not attempted to verify them through the U.S. Armed Services Center for Unit Records Research (CURR). Outpatient records which have been obtained include references to possible PTSD, although the veteran has not been given a VA compensation examination.

#Evidential Support#
In written argument to the Board, the veteran's representative argues that the VA should attempt to verify stressors and provide a VA examination.

#Reasoning#
The Board agrees that such is warranted as part of the VA's duty to assist the veteran in developing evidence pertinent to his claim.

#Outcome#
the case is remanded
