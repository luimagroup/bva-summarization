#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty from December 1969 to July 1971.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2010 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

#Reasoning#
The December 2014 Board remand instructed the AOJ to schedule the Veteran for a VA psychological examination to determine the nature and etiology of his claimed mental disorder.

#Evidential Support#
A review of the record reveals that the Veteran missed his examination due to a medical emergency. The Veteran has requested that the examination be rescheduled.

#Evidential Support#
As the Veteran has presented good cause for his failure to appear at the examination, his request will be granted and another mental health examination should be scheduled in compliance with the Board's initial remand directives.

#Outcome#
the case is REMANDED
