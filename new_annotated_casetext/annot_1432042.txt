#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran had active military service from June 1965 to August 1972, including two tours of duty in the Republic of Vietnam.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2007 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Houston, Texas, which denied service connection for PTSD and entitlement to nonservice-connected pension.

#Reasoning#
The medical and lay evidence of record fails to demonstrate the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD.

#Reasoning#
The Veteran's depressive and anxiety symptoms are more likely than not related to his polysubstance abuse and/or dependence.

#Evidential Support#
In rendering this diagnosis, the examiner stated that it was made primarily by review of medical records, including medical consequences of substances as the Veteran reported minimal to no significant negative consequences of drug/alcohol use and only acknowledged alcohol and crack cocaine use.

#Evidential Support#
Consequently, the only evidence of record that indicates the Veteran has PTSD is his own statements to that effect.

#Outcome#
Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.
