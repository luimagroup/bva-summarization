#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for hypertension to include as secondary to head/neck trauma and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran served on active duty from October 1973 to October 1993.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision dated in January 2004 by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Columbia, South Carolina.

#Outcome#
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC. VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.

#Evidential Support#
The VA examiner did not address the question of whether the Veteran's PTSD caused the Veteran's hypertension and he did not address at all the issue of whether the Veteran's residuals of a head trauma caused or aggravated the Veteran's hypertension.

#Evidential Support#
Furthermore, the Board notes that the VA examiner did not provide a rationale for his opinion.

#Reasoning#
The examiner is requested to review all pertinent records associated with the claims file and offer an opinion as to whether it is more likely than not (i.e., probably greater than 50 percent), at least as likely as not (i.e., probability of 50 percent), or less likely than not (i.e., probability less than 50 percent), that the Veteran's service-connected residuals of head trauma and/or PTSD caused or aggravated his hypertension.

#Reasoning#
The examiner should also provide an opinion on whether the Veteran's hypertension is as likely as not (i.e., probability of 50 percent) related to active military service or any symptomatology shown in service.

#Reasoning#
The examiner is requested to include a rationale for all conclusions and confirm that the claims file was available for review.
