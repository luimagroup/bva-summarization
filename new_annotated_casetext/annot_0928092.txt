#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran had active military service from December 1973 to December 1974 and from March 1981 to April 1983.

#Procedural History#
This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a July 2003 rating action of the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in New Orleans, Louisiana, that declined to reopen the claim for service connection for PTSD.

#Outcome#
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.

#Evidential Support#
There is no indication of record that the RO adjudicated the Veteran's claimed personal (sexual assault) stressor.

#Evidential Support#
Thereafter, the record reflects that the Veteran has been treated, at times, in the VA clinical setting for PTSD. The basis for the diagnosis is not fully explained.

#Evidential Support#
Moreover, the record contains conflicting opinions by various examiners as to whether the DSM-IV criteria for a PTSD diagnosis have been met, and the Board cannot discern from either the favorable or unfavorable opinions the exact basis as to how all DSM-IV criteria have been met.

#Reasoning#
the favorable opinions in this case are not based upon sufficient facts, some of which remained to be adjudicated,

#Reasoning#
As such, the Board finds ample and necessary basis to remand this case for additional medical opinion.
