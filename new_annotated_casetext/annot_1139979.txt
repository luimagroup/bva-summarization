#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include bipolar disorder, depression, schizoaffective disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran was in the United States Navy from August 1976 to March 1984 but with only one year, four months, and 12 days of active service due to unauthorized absences from October 28, 1977 to April 30, 1978 and from May 3, 1978 to January 9, 1984.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2008 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Nashville, Tennessee, Regional Office (RO) that denied the appellant's claim for depression.

#Outcome#
The appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.

#Evidential Support#
A March 1984 service personnel record shows that the United States Navy was unable to locate the appellant's health and dental records due to his lengthy periods of unauthorized absence.

#Reasoning#
In light of the above, a VA examination with a medical opinion is necessary for the adjudication of this claim.

#Evidential Support#
The Veteran is receiving Social Security disability benefits.

#Reasoning#
The Social Security Administration records are potentially relevant to his claim and must be obtained.

#Reasoning#
Finally, the Veteran has identified various providers of psychiatric treatment and should be afforded one last opportunity to submit individual authorizations of release for those providers.
