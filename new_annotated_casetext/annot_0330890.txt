#Procedural History#
On appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Louisville, Kentucky

#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Evidential Support#
In August 2002, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) ordered further development in your case.

#Evidential Support#
Thereafter, your case was sent to the Board's Evidence Development Unit (EDU), to undertake the requested development.

#Reasoning#
Recently, in light of the Federal Circuit Court's decision and other policy considerations, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) determined that VBA would resume all development functions.

#Reasoning#
In other words, aside from the limited class of development functions that the Board is statutorily permitted to carry out, see 38 U.S.C.A. �� 7107(b), 7109(a), all evidence development will be conducted at the regional office (RO) level.

#Outcome#
Accordingly, this matter is REMANDED to the RO

#Service History#
Such records should encompass the veteran's entire period of active duty, from August 1965 until August 1967.

#Reasoning#
After the development requested above has been completed to the extent possible, the RO should again review the record.
