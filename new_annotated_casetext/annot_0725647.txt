#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The appellant is a veteran who served on active duty from July 1966 to July 1969, including service in the Republic of Vietnam from September 1968 to July 1969.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2004 rating decision by the Togus, Maine, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

#Reasoning#
The evidence of record demonstrates the veteran's presently diagnosed PTSD is a result of a verified stressor that occurred during active service in Vietnam.

#Evidential Support#
In this case, the veteran's service records show that he served in Vietnam with the Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) 54th General Support Group.

#Evidential Support#
From January 2002 to September 2003, C. A. P., D.O. treated the veteran for depression and PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
In his notes, Dr. W. explained that the veteran had PTSD secondary to his military service due to his exposure to combat in Vietnam.

#Evidential Support#
Of those stressors, the psychiatrist specifically mentioned that the verified mortar fire in Nha Trang on February 24, 1969, would be enough of a stressor on its own to meet the criteria for a credible diagnosis of PTSD.

#Reasoning#
Based upon the evidence of record, the Board finds the veteran has a present PTSD disability.

#Reasoning#
Those opinions provided the necessary medical nexus between the veteran's current PTSD and an in-service stressor.

#Reasoning#
The veteran's claimed in-service stressor of rocket fire around Nha Trang was verified by a search of his unit's records.

#Outcome#
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.
