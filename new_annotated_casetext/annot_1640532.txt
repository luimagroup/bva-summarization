#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The Veteran had active duty service from June 1980 to September 1988.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2011 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Detroit, Michigan.

#Evidential Support#
The Veteran is currently diagnosed with major depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD.

#Evidential Support#
The enlistment examination and separation records were negative for symptoms or a diagnosis of a mental disability.

#Evidential Support#
An August 2009 VA treatment record reflects severe depression possibly attributed to military intelligence stress and dangerous situations.

#Evidential Support#
A December 2010 VA examination, in part, the examiner opined that anxiety and major depression was less likely as not related to the in service experiences.

#Outcome#
Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:

#Reasoning#
After completing the development requested above, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate medical examiner to determine the nature and etiology of any psychiatric disorder(s).

#Reasoning#
(a) Identify whether the Veteran currently has PTSD under the diagnostic criteria, and if so, whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., a 50 percent or greater probability) that the disability is etiologically related to the Veteran's active military service, to include her service in Berlin, being in fear of hostile military activity, and/or military sexual trauma. If specific stressors have been verified, the examiner should be advised of such stressors.

#Reasoning#
(b) Identify whether the Veteran has any other acquired psychiatric disorder(s) under the diagnostic criteria, and if so, provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the disorder had its onset during, or is otherwise etiologically related to, the Veteran's active military service.
