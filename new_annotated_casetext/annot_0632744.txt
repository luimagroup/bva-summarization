#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran had active service from April 1965 until May 1970.

#Procedural History#
This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) from a December 2002 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO) in No. Little Rock, Arkansas.

#Evidential Support#
The RO also stated that the veteran has not provided the name of the person killed.

#Evidential Support#
The veteran's contention that he was driving a military vehicle that struck and killed a seven-year old Korean girl, his stressor, is unsupported by the objective evidence of record.

#Reasoning#
Therefore, in the absence of objective evidence to corroborate the veteran's presence as to the event he described, the claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD must be denied.

#Outcome#
Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.
