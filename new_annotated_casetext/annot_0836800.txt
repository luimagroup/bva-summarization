#Issue#
Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

#Service History#
The veteran served on active duty from December 1984 to December 1987.

#Procedural History#
This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) on appeal from a May 2004 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in Atlanta, Georgia (RO), which denied the benefit sought on appeal.

#Evidential Support#
In the present case, the evidence indicates the veteran had PTSD that clearly preexisted service.

#Evidential Support#
For example, a June 2003 report from a private psychologist, R.R.B., Ph.D., provides that the veteran had long-standing mood and anxiety problems.

#Evidential Support#
The Board also finds that the medical evidence of record, overall, demonstrates that the veteran's preexisting PTSD did not undergo an increase in severity during service and was thus not aggravated by service.

#Reasoning#
Overall, the Board finds that the evidence shows that the veteran did not incur or aggravate PTSD during active duty. As the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.

#Outcome#
Service connection for PTSD is denied.
